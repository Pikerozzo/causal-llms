37598488,Precision anatomy for minimally invasive spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy in children: A case report of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm in a 12-year-old girl.,"Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a rare and low malignant tumor found mainly in young females. There is no standardized procedure for SPN of the pancreatic body and tail in children. In adults, an international consensus on precision anatomy for minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy (MIDP) was established recently (PAM-HBP Surgery Project). The aim of this study is to demonstrate that precision anatomy can also be safely and effectively implemented in the pediatric population. A 12-year-old girl with an incidentally found SPN located in the pancreatic tail was referred to our hospital. She successfully underwent an R0 resection by laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (LSPDP) under the concept of precision anatomy. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day 7. This is the first successful report of LSPDP under the concept of precision anatomy in children. In accordance with the recommendations from the international consensus, the ""anterior approach"" was selected to dissect and encircle the splenic artery based on the vascular anatomy identified by preoperative imaging. The dorsal dissection border of the pancreas along the anterior layer above the Gerota's fascia was carefully maintained and the splenic vessels were preserved taking into consideration the low malignant potential of SPN and to decrease the risk of complications associated with splenectomy, which were also the essential issues of the consensus. The implementation of precision anatomy for pediatric pancreas surgery should facilitate the safe diffusion of MIDP for SPN and other benign or low-malignant tumors in children.","['Case report', 'Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy', 'Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy', 'Pediatric pancreatic tumor', 'Precision anatomy', 'Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm']",2023-04-12,['splenectomy']
37593336,Splenic infarction secondary to polycythemia Vera: Case report and literature review.,"Splenic infarction is a medical condition characterized by compromised blood flow to the spleen, resulting in partial or complete organ infarction. This condition is commonly observed in patients with an increased risk of thrombosis, such as those with Polycythemia Vera (PV). A 40-year-old female patient presented with fatigue, weakness, and an enlarged spleen, further tests revealed elevated levels of hemoglobin, white blood cells, and platelets. A bone marrow biopsy and positive Jack II mutations confirmed the diagnosis of PV. The patient later developed portal hypertension, varices, and splenic infarction. This case report aims to raise awareness about the potential complications of PV and emphasizes the importance of early intervention to prevent serious consequences such as splenic infarction. Additionally, it highlights the role of splenectomy in managing complications associated with PV.","['Case', 'Infarction', 'Polycythemia Vera', 'Report', 'Secondary', 'Splenic']",2023-06-11,['splenectomy']
37589433,Endotheliopathy of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver disease.,"Liver is the largest solid organ in the abdominal cavity, with sinusoid occupying about half of its volume. Under liver disease, hemodynamics in the liver tissue dynamically change, resulting in injury to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). We discuss the injury of LSECs in liver diseases in this article. Generally, in noninflamed tissues, vascular endothelial cells maintain quiescence of circulating leukocytes, and unnecessary blood clotting is inhibited by multiple antithrombotic factors produced by the endothelial cells. In the setting of inflammation, injured endothelial cells lose these functions, defined as inflammatory endotheliopathy. In chronic hepatitis C, inflammatory endotheliopathy in LSECs contributes to platelet accumulation in the liver tissue, and the improvement of thrombocytopenia by splenectomy is attenuated in cases with severe hepatic inflammation. In COVID-19, LSEC endotheliopathy induced by interleukin (IL)-6 trans-signaling promotes neutrophil accumulation and platelet microthrombosis in the liver sinusoids, resulting in liver injury. IL-6 trans-signaling promotes the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL1), and CXCL2, which are the neutrophil chemotactic mediators, and P-selectin, E-selectin, and von Willebrand factor, which are involved in platelet adhesion to endothelial cells, in LSECs. Restoring LSECs function is important for ameliorating liver injury. Prevention of endotheliopathy is a potential therapeutic strategy in liver disease.","['SARS-CoV-2', 'chronic hepatitis', 'interleukin-6', 'liver sinusoidal endothelial cell', 'thrombosis']",2023-07-21,['splenectomy']
37587041,A Case of Gastric Varices Rupture Due to Splenic Vein Obstruction Associated with Autoimmune Pancreatitis.,"A 60-year-old man with a high IgG4 level was found to have pancreatic tail enlargement on computed tomography (CT), and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) was confirmed by a histological diagnosis. He was treated with prednisolone for one year and seven months, at which point his treatment finished. Four months later, however, he had hematemesis from gastric varices. CT showed recurrence of pancreatic tail enlargement with obstruction of the splenic artery and vein and formation of collateral blood vessels to the gastric fornix. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy was performed, and he underwent splenectomy. This case highlights the importance of paying attention to peripancreatic vascular abnormalities during follow-up of AIP patients.","['autoimmune pancreatitis', 'splenic vein', 'varices']",,['splenectomy']
37582488,Prevalence of malignancy and factors affecting outcome of cats undergoing splenectomy.,"To determine the prevalence of splenic malignancy in cats undergoing splenectomy and to investigate possible factors associated with post-operative outcome. 62 client-owned cats that underwent splenectomy. Medical records of 4 UK-based referral hospitals were searched and data reviewed retrospectively over 17 years. Factors associated with outcomes post-splenectomy were analyzed. 50 out of 62 cats (81%) were diagnosed with splenic neoplasia. Mast cell tumor ([MCT], 42%), hemangiosarcoma ([HSA], 40%), lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma (6% each) were the most common tumor types. Fifteen cats (24%) presented with spontaneous hemoabdomen and were all diagnosed with splenic neoplasia. The diagnostic accuracy of cytology to detect splenic malignant lesions was 73% (100% for MCTs and 54% for mesenchymal tumors). Median survival time for cats with nonneoplastic splenic lesions was 715 days (IQR, 18 to 1,368) and 136 days for cats with splenic neoplasia (IQR, 35 to 348); median survival time was longer for cats with splenic MCT when compared to cats with HSA (348 vs 94 days; P < .001). Presence of metastatic disease and anemia (PCV < 24%) at diagnosis were associated with a poorer survival when considering all cats. Presence of anemia, a splenic mass on imaging or spontaneous hemoabdomen were associated with a diagnosis of HSA (P < .001). Benign splenic lesions were uncommon in this cohort of cats. Spontaneous hemoabdomen should prompt the clinician to suspect neoplasia in cats with splenic disease. Anemia and evidence of metastasis at diagnosis were poor prognostic factors regardless of the final diagnosis.","['feline', 'hemangiosarcoma', 'hemoabdomen', 'mast cell tumor', 'splenectomy']",2023-05-23,['splenectomy']
