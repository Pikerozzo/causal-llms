37253410,Metformin protects against retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury through AMPK-mediated mitochondrial fusion.,"Retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathological process responsible for cellular damage in glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy. Metformin is a biguanide drug that exerts strong effects on multiple diseases. This study aims to evaluate the protective effect of metformin against retinal I/R injury and its underlying mechanism. I/R induced reduction in retina thickness and cell number in ganglion cell layer, and metformin alleviated I/R-induced retinal injury. Both retinal I/R and simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SIR) in R28 cells down-regulated expression of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 and OPA1, which led to mitochondrial fission. Metformin also alleviated damage in R28 cells, and reversed the alteration in Mfn2 and OPA1, mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption-induced by I/R or SIR as well. Intriguingly, inhibition of AMPK by compound C or siRNA prevented metformin-mediated up-regulation of Mfn2 and OPA1. Compound C and knockdown of Mfn2 or OPA1 dramatically alleviated the protective effect of metformin against intracellular ROS generation, MMP disruption, mitochondrial fission and loss of RGCs in ganglion cell layer-induced by SIR or I/R. Moreover, scavenging mitochondrial ROS (mito-ROS) by mito-TEMPO exerted the similar protection against I/R-induced retinal injury or SIR-induced damage in R28 cells as metformin. Our data show for the first time that metformin protects against retinal I/R injury through AMPK-mediated mitochondrial fusion and the decreased mito-ROS generation. These findings might also repurpose metformin as a therapeutic agent for retinal I/R injury.","['AMPK', 'Metformin', 'Mitochondrial dynamics', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury']",2023-03-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37252276,Ginsenoside compound K protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via Mul1/Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergy.,"Ginsenoside compound K (CK), the main active metabolite in Panax ginseng, has shown good safety and bioavailability in clinical trials and exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemic stroke. However, its potential role in the prevention of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of ginsenoside CK against cerebral I/R injury.We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion induced PC12 cell model and middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion induced rat model, to mimic I/R injury. Intracellular oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate were analyzed by Seahorse multifunctional energy metabolism system; ATP production was detected by luciferase method. The number and size of mitochondria were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and MitoTracker probe combined with confocal laser microscopy. The potential mechanisms of ginsenoside CK on mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergy were evaluated by RNA interference, pharmacological antagonism combined with co-immunoprecipitation analysis and phenotypic analysis.Ginsenoside CK pretreatment could attenuate mitochondrial translocation of DRP1, mitophagy, mitochondrial apoptosis, and neuronal bioenergy imbalance against cerebral I/R injury in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our data also confirmed that ginsenoside CK administration could reduce the binding affinity of Mul1 and Mfn2 to inhibit the ubiquitination and degradation of Mfn2, thereby elevating the protein level of Mfn2 in cerebral I/R injury.These data provide evidence that ginsenoside CK may be a promising therapeutic agent against cerebral I/R injury via Mul1/Mfn2-mediated mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergy.","['Bioenergy', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Ginsenoside compound K', 'Mitochondrial dynamics', 'Mul1/Mfn2 ubiquitination']",2022-06-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37251826,Non-coding RNA mediates endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in heart disease.,"Apoptosis is a complex and highly self-regulating form of cell death, which is an important cause of the continuous decline in ventricular function and is widely involved in the occurrence and development of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocarditis. Endoplasmic reticulum stress plays a crucial role in apoptosis-inducing. Accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins causes cells to undergo a stress response called unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR initially has a cardioprotective effect. Nevertheless, prolonged and severe ER stress will lead up to apoptosis of stressed cells. Non-coding RNA is a type of RNA that does not code proteins. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that non-coding RNAs are involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cardiomyocyte injury and apoptosis. In this study, the effects of miRNA and LncRNA on endoplasmic reticulum stress in various heart diseases were mainly discussed to clarify their protective effects and potential therapeutic strategies for apoptosis.","['Apoptosis', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'Heart disease', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Non-coding RNA', 'microRNA']",2022-09-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37251271,E-Selectin/AAV Gene Therapy Promotes Myogenesis and Skeletal Muscle Recovery in a Mouse Hindlimb Ischemia Model.,"The response to ischemia in peripheral artery disease (PAD) depends on compensatory neovascularization and coordination of tissue regeneration. Identifying novel mechanisms regulating these processes is critical to the development of nonsurgical treatments for PAD. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule that mediates cell recruitment during neovascularization. Therapeutic priming of ischemic limb tissues with intramuscular E-selectin gene therapy promotes angiogenesis and reduces tissue loss in a murine hindlimb gangrene model. In this study, we evaluated the effects of E-selectin gene therapy on skeletal muscle recovery, specifically focusing on exercise performance and myofiber regeneration. C57BL/6J mice were treated with intramuscular E-selectin/adeno-associated virus serotype 2/2 gene therapy (E-sel/AAV) or LacZ/AAV2/2 (LacZ/AAV) as control and then subjected to femoral artery coagulation. Recovery of hindlimb perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and muscle function by treadmill exhaustion and grip strength testing. After three postoperative weeks, hindlimb muscle was harvested for immunofluorescence analysis. At all postoperative time points, mice treated with E-sel/AAV had improved hindlimb perfusion and exercise capacity. E-sel/AAV gene therapy also increased the coexpression of MyoD and Ki-67 in skeletal muscle progenitors and the proportion of Myh7+ myofibers. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that in addition to improving reperfusion, intramuscular E-sel/AAV gene therapy enhances the regeneration of ischemic skeletal muscle with a corresponding benefit on exercise performance. These results suggest a potential role for E-sel/AAV gene therapy as a nonsurgical adjunct in patients with life-limiting PAD.",[],2023-02-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249913,Insufficient oxygen inhalation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation induces early changes in hemodynamics followed by late and unfavorable systemic responses in post-cardiac arrest rats.,"Cardiac arrest (CA) and concomitant post-CA syndrome lead to a lethal condition characterized by systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxygen (O2 ) supply during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the key to success in resuscitation, but sustained hyperoxia can produce toxic effects post CA. However, only few studies have investigated the optimal duration and dosage of O2 administration. Herein, we aimed to determine whether high concentrations of O2 at resuscitation are beneficial or harmful. After rats were resuscitated from the 10-min asphyxia, mechanical ventilation was restarted at an FIO2 of 1.0 or 0.3. From 10 min after initiating CPR, FIO2 of both groups were maintained at 0.3. Bio-physiological parameters including O2 consumption (VO2 ) and mRNA gene expression in multiple organs were evaluated. The FIO2 0.3 group decreased VO2 , delayed the time required to achieve peak MAP, lowered ejection fraction (75.1 ± 3.3% and 59.0 ± 5.7% with FIO2 1.0 and 0.3, respectively; p < .05), and increased blood lactate levels (4.9 ± 0.2 mmol/L and 5.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L, respectively; p < .05) at 10 min after CPR. FIO2 0.3 group had significant increases in hypoxia-inducible factor, inflammatory, and apoptosis-related mRNA gene expression in the brain. Likewise, significant upregulations of hypoxia-inducible factor and apoptosis-related gene expression were observed in the FIO2 0.3 group in the heart and lungs. Insufficient O2 supplementation in the first 10 min of resuscitation could prolong ischemia, and may result in unfavorable biological responses 2 h after CA. Faster recovery from the impairment of O2 metabolism might contribute to the improvement of hemodynamics during the early post-resuscitation phase; therefore, it may be reasonable to provide the maximum feasible O2 concentrations during CPR.","['cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'heart arrest', 'hyperoxia', 'ischemia', 'oxygen consumption', 'reperfusion injury']",2022-12-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249897,NR4A1 Aggravates Myocardial Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting OPA1-Mediated Mitochondrial Fusion.,"Mitochondrial fusion is an important process that protects the myocardium. However, mitochondrial fusion is often inhibited in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IR). The upstream mechanism of this effect is unclear. Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) can aggravate myocardial IR and increase the level of oxidative stress, thereby affecting mitochondrial function and morphology. Inhibiting NR4A1 can improve oxidative stress levels and mitochondrial function and morphology, thereby reducing IR. Downregulating NR4A1 increases the expression level of the mitochondrial fusion-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), which is associated with these benefits. Inhibiting OPA1 expression with MYLS22 abrogates the effects of NR4A1 downregulation on IR. Furthermore, NR4A1 disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and activates the STING and NF-κB pathways. Insufficient mitochondrial fusion and increased apoptosis and inflammatory reactions worsen irreversible damage to cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, NR4A1 can exacerbate IR by inhibiting OPA1, causing mitochondrial damage.","['Mitochondria', 'Myocardial ischaemia–reperfusion injury', 'NR4A1', 'OPA1', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-12-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249725,Revascularization and angiogenesis for bone bioengineering in the craniofacial region: a review.,"The revascularization of grafted tissues is a complicated and non-straightforward process, which makes it challenging to perform reconstructive surgery for critical-sized bone defects. This challenge is combined with the low vascularity that results from radiotherapy. This low vascularity could result from ischemia-reperfusion injuries, also known as ischemia which may happen upon grafting. Ischemia may affect the hard tissue during reconstruction, and this can often cause resorption, infections, disfigurement, and malunion. This paper therefore reviews the clinical and experimental application of procedures that were employed to improve the reconstructive surgery process, which would ensure that the vascularity of the tissue is maintained or enhanced. It also presents the key strategies that are implemented to perform tissue engineering within the grafted sites aiming to optimize the microenvironment and to enhance the overall process of neovascularization and angiogenesis. This review reveals that the current strategies, according to the literature, are the seeding of the mature and progenitor cells, use of extracellular matrix (ECM), co-culturing of osteoblasts with the ECM, growth factors and the use of microcapillaries incorporated into the scaffold design. However, due to the unstable and regression-prone capillary structures in bone constructs, further research focusing on creating long-lasting and stable blood vessels is required.","['Bioengineering', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injuries', 'Mesenchymal stromal cells', 'Neovascularization', 'Reconstructive surgery', 'Revascularization']",2022-12-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249560,Myocardial protection in paediatric cardiac surgery: building an evidence-based strategy.,"Cardioplegia is fundamental to the surgical repair of congenital heart defects by protecting the heart against ischaemia/reperfusion injury, characterised by low cardiac output and troponin release in the early postoperative period. The immature myocardium exhibits structural, physiological and metabolic differences from the adult heart, with a greater sensitivity to calcium overload-mediated injury during reperfusion. Del Nido cardioplegia was designed specifically to protect the immature heart, is widely used in North America and may provide better myocardial protection in children; however, it has not been commercially available in the UK, where most centres use St Thomas' blood cardioplegia. There are no phase 3 clinical trials in children to support one solution over another and this lack of evidence, combined with variations in practice, suggests the presence of clinical equipoise. The best cardioplegia solution for use in children, and the impact of age and other clinical factors remain unknown. In this Hunterian lecture, I propose an evidence-based strategy to improve myocardial protection during cardiac surgery in children through: (1) conducting multicentre clinical trials of established techniques; (2) improving our knowledge of ischaemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of cardioplegic arrest; (3) applying this to drive innovation, moving beyond current cardioplegia solutions; (4) empowering personalised medicine, through combining clinical and genomic data, including ethnic diversity; and (5) understanding the impact of cardioplegic arrest on the late outcomes that matter to patients and their families.","['Cardiac surgery', 'Cardioplegia', 'Children', 'Myocardial protection']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249366,The plant-derived alkaloid aloperine prevents ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced sudden cardiac death.,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a major cause of global mortality. In addition to modern interventions, botanical folk medicines have long been used to treat cardiovascular disease, although the efficacy and underlying mechanisms are often unresolved. Aloperine, a bioactive quinolizidine alkaloid isolated from Sophora alopecuroides plants, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and vasorelaxant properties, but possible antiarrhythmic effects of aloperine in SCD are unclear. Here, we examined whether aloperine protects against ischemia and reperfusion injury-associated lethal ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Rats were divided into sham, control, and aloperine groups, and reperfusion-provoked ventricular arrhythmogenesis, cardiac damage markers, and signaling pathways quantified following left main coronary artery ischemia and reperfusion. In vitro studies of effects of aloperine on hERG and Kv4.3 cardiac voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels were performed using two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of cloned channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Aloperine pretreatment (10 mg/kg) did not affect baseline cardiac electrical stability; yet, it reduced ventricular arrhythmogenesis and susceptibility to SCD (mortality rate: control: 64.3%; aloperine: 0%) induced by reperfusion injury. Aloperine also reduced serum levels of LDH, CK-MB, α-HBDH, and cTnI post-I/R, and stimulated phosphorylation of ventricular ERK1/2 and STAT-3, which are key components of RISK and SAFE signaling pathways. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 (with U0126) or STAT-3 (with Ag490) abolished aloperine-induced anti-arrhythmic effects and ERK1/2 and STAT-3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, while aloperine (100 μM) had no effect on cloned Kv4.3 activity, aloperine (1 μM and up) negative-shifted the voltage dependence of hERG activation by ~10 mV and increased peak hERG current by 35%. Thus, aloperine exerts striking anti-arrhythmic effects against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury-induced severe lethal ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death via the ERK1/2/STAT-3 signaling pathway, with potential additional contribution from increased cardiac myocyte repolarization capacity via augmented hERG activity.","['\nSophora\n', 'ERK1/2', 'STAT3', 'arrhythmia']",2023-02-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249015,Spatial Multiplexed Protein Profiling of Cardiac Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Reperfusion therapy is critical to myocardial salvage in the event of a myocardial infarction but is complicated by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Limited understanding of the spatial organization of cardiac cells, which governs cellular interaction and function, has hindered the search for targeted interventions minimizing the deleterious effects of IRI.We used imaging mass cytometry to characterize the spatial distribution and dynamics of cell phenotypes and communities in the mouse left ventricle following IRI. Heart sections were collected from 12 cardiac segments (basal, mid-cavity, apical, and apex of the anterior, lateral, and inferior wall) and 8 time points (before ischemia [I-0H], and postreperfusion [R-0H, R-2H, R-6H, R-12H, R-1D, R-3D, R-7D]), and stained with 29 metal-isotope-tagged antibodies. Cell community analysis was performed on reconstructed images, and the most disease-relevant cell type and target protein were selected for intervention of IRI.We obtained a total of 251 multiplexed images, and identified 197 063 single cells, which were grouped into 23 distinct cell communities based on the structure of cellular neighborhoods. The cellular architecture was heterogeneous throughout the ventricular wall and exhibited swift changes following IRI. Analysis of proteins with posttranslational modifications in single cells unveiled 13 posttranslational modification intensity clusters and highlighted increased H3K9me3 (tri-methylated lysine 9 of histone H3) as a key regulatory response in endothelial cells during the middle stage of IRI. Erasing H3K9 methylation, by silencing its methyltransferase Suv39h1 or overexpressing its demethylase Kdm4d in isolated endothelial cells, attenuated cardiac dysfunction and pathological remodeling following IRI. in vitro, H3K9me3 binding significantly increased at endothelial cell function-related genes upon hypoxia, suppressing tube formation, which was rescued by inhibiting H3K9me3.We mapped the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of cellular phenotypes in the adult heart upon IRI, and uncovered H3K9me3 in endothelial cells as a potential therapeutic target for alleviating pathological remodeling of the heart following myocardial IRI.","['endothelial cells', 'ischemia', 'myocardial infarction', 'reperfusion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37249014,Exogenous GalR2-specific peptide agonist as a tool for treating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"The aim of this work was to elucidate the role of GalR2 receptor activation in protecting the rat heart in vivo from I/R damage by a pharmacological peptide agonist WTLNSAGYLLGPβAH-OH (G1) and full-length rat galanin GWTLNSAGYLLGPHAIDNHRSFSDKHGLT-NH2 (G2) using M871, a selective inhibitor of GalR2. The peptides were prepared by the automatic solid phase synthesis using the Fmoc-strategy and purified by HPLC. 40-minute LAD coronary artery occlusion followed by a 60-minute reperfusion was performed. The criteria for damage/protection of the heart were the infarct size (IS) and plasma activity of CK-MB at the end of reperfusion. Intravenous injection of G1 or G2 at an optimal dose of 1 mg/kg at the 5th minute of reperfusion significantly reduced the IS (by 35 and 32%, respectively) and activity of CK-MB at the end of reperfusion (by 43 and 38%, respectively) compared with the control. Administration of M871 (8 mg/kg) 5 min before the onset of reperfusion abolished the effects of G1 on IS and CK-MB activity, returning them to control values. Co-administration of M871 (8 mg/kg) with G2 attenuated protective effect of G2 on both IS and plasma СK-MB activity. However, differences in these parameters between the M871+G2 and G2 groups did not reach statistical significance (P=0.139 and P=0.121, respectively). Thus, GalR2 is the principal receptor subtype that transduces the protective effects of galanin and ligand G1 in myocardial I/R injury. This suggests that GalR2-specific peptide agonists could be used as drug candidates for treating ischemic heart disease.","['GalR2 receptor', 'M871', 'myocardial infarction', 'rat heart', 'solid phase synthesis']",2023-03-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37248964,Cpd-42 Alleviates Acute Kidney Injury via Targeting RIPK3-mediated Necroptosis.,"Necroptosis plays an essential role in acute kidney injury (AKI) and is mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinases (RIPK)1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). As a novel RIPK3 inhibitor, Cpd-42 alleviates the systemic inflammatory response. The current study was designed to investigate whether Cpd-42 exhibits protective effects on AKI and reveal the underlying mechanisms.The effects of Cpd-42 were determined in vivo through cisplatin- and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced AKI, and in vitro through cisplatin- and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell damage. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and periodic acid-schiff (PAS) staining were used to identify renal pathology. Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and RIPK3 knockout (KO) mTECs were used to explore the relationship between Cpd-42 and RIPK3. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine the binding site of RIPK3 with Cpd-42.Cpd-42 reduced HK-2 cell damage, necroptosis, and inflammatory responses in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo, cisplatin- and I/R-induced AKI was alleviated by Cpd-42 treatment. Cpd-42 inhibited necroptosis by interacting with two key hydrogen bonds of RIPK3 at Thr94 and Ser146, which further blocked the phosphorylation of RIPK3 and mitigated AKI.As a novel RIPK3 inhibitor, Cpd-42 reduced kidney damage, inflammatory response, and necroptosis in AKI by binding to sites Thr94 and Ser146 on RIPK3 and might be a promising treatment for AKI.","['Cpd-42', 'RIPK3 inhibitor', 'acute kidney injury', 'necroptosis']",2022-07-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37248543,TRIM67 alleviates cerebral ischemia‒reperfusion injury by protecting neurons and inhibiting neuroinflammation via targeting IκBα for K63-linked polyubiquitination.,"Excessive and unresolved neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders, such as ischemic stroke, yet there are no effective treatments. Tripartite motif-containing 67 (TRIM67) plays a crucial role in the control of inflammatory disease and pathogen infection-induced inflammation; however, the role of TRIM67 in cerebral ischemia‒reperfusion injury remains poorly understood.In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression level of TRIM67 was significantly reduced in middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) mice and primary cultured microglia subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion. Furthermore, a significant reduction in infarct size and neurological deficits was observed in mice after TRIM67 upregulation. Interestingly, TRIM67 upregulation alleviated neuroinflammation and cell death after cerebral ischemia‒reperfusion injury in MCAO/R mice. A mechanistic study showed that TRIM67 bound to IκBα, reduced K48-linked ubiquitination and increased K63-linked ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting its degradation and promoting the stability of IκBα, ultimately inhibiting NF-κB activity after cerebral ischemia.Taken together, this study demonstrated a previously unidentified mechanism whereby TRIM67 regulates neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis and strongly indicates that upregulation of TRIM67 may provide therapeutic benefits for ischemic stroke.","['Cerebral ischemia‒reperfusion injury', 'IκBα', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Neuronal apoptosis', 'TRIM67', 'Ubiquitination']",2023-02-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37248113,Adipose delivered stem cells protect liver after ischemia-reperfusion injury by controlling autophagy.,"Ischemia-reperfusion(I/R) injury is an unavoidable side effect of liver surgery and transplantation. A potentially useful tool for cellular therapy and tissue engineering is adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs).The process of autophagy is used by the cell to break down inappropriate molecules.The study's goal was to examine the impact of ADSCs on the autophagic pathway after rat hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.Thirty male rats used in our study were divided into control, ADSC, ischemia, I/R, and I/R+ ADSC groups (n = 6). Liver tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and histological changes were evaluated with Suzuki scoring. Immunoexpressions of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) and autophagy markers LC3B, p62 were analyzed using the immunohistochemical method.As a result of histological evaluation the ischemia and I/R groups displayed sinusoid congestion, vacuolization, and necrosis in liver tissues. We showed that the immunostaining of LC3B and TGF- β were elevated, and p62 decreased in the rat liver from ischemia and I/R groups when compared to the control group.ADSCs reduced the excessive level of autophagy and structural damage to hepatocytes and the pathological alterations in the liver after ıschemia-reperfusion injury.","['Adipose-derived stem cells(ADSCs)', 'Autophagy', 'Histopathology', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Liver']",2023-04-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37247854,[Acupuncture regulates autophagy in hippocampal neurons of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injured rats by activating type Ⅲ PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway].,"To observe the effects of acupuncture on the expression of type Ⅲ phosphatidylinositol 3-hydroxykinase (PI3K) and Beclin-1 in hippocampus of rats with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI), so as to explore the mechanism of acupuncture in regulating type Ⅲ PI3K pathway to activate autophagy in the hippocampal neurons of CI/RI rats.SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group (n=11) and operation group. Then after successful modeling, rats in the operation group were randomly divided into model, acupuncture, model+3-MA and acupuncture+3-MA groups, with 11 rats in each group. The model of CI/RI was established by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Rats in the model+3-MA and acupuncture+3-MA groups were injected with 3-MA (400 nmol/ 5 μL) 5 μL into the lateral ventricle 30 min before reperfusion. Rats in the acupuncture and acupuncture+3-MA groups were punctured with filiform needles at ""Dazhui"" (GV14), ""Shuigou"" (GV26) and ""Baihui"" (GV20) and stimulated manually once every 15 min. The acupuncture intervention was conducted for 30 min each time, once every 12 h for a total of 7 times. The degree of neurological impairment was evaluated 2 h after reperfusion and after intervention by Garcia score. After intervention, the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was observed by TTC staining, the protein expression levels of type Ⅲ PI3K, Beclin-1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), lysosome associated membrane protein 2 (Lamp2) and P62 in ischemic hippocampal tissue were detected by Western blot, the ultrastructure of neurons in ischemic hippocampus was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).Compared with the sham operation group, the Garcia score was decreased (P<0.01), the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was increased (P<0.01), the expression levels of type Ⅲ PI3K, Beclin-1, LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ, Lamp2 proteins were decreased (P<0.01), and the expression level of P62 protein was increased (P<0.01) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the model group. Compared with the model group, the Garcia score was increased (P<0.01), the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was decreased (P<0.01), the expression levels of type Ⅲ PI3K, Beclin-1, LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ, Lamp2 proteins were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05) and the expression level of P62 was decreased (P<0.01) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the acupuncture group； the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was increased (P<0.05), the expressions of type Ⅲ PI3K and Beclin-1 were decreased (P<0.01) and the expression level of P62 protein was increased (P<0.05) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the mo-del+3-MA group. Compared with the model +3-MA group, the Garcia score was increased (P<0.05), the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was decreased (P<0.01), the expression levels of type Ⅲ PI3K, Beclin-1, LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ in ischemic hippo-campal tissue were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the acupuncture+3-MA group. Compared with the acupuncture group, the Garcia score was decreased, the percentage of cerebral ischemic area was increased (P<0.05, P<0.01), the expression levels of type Ⅲ PI3K, Beclin-1, Lamp2 proteins were decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05) and P62 protein was increased (P<0.05) in ischemic hippocampal tissue in the acupuncture+3-MA group. The results of TEM showed that the edema of neurons was heavier, and few hypolysosomes existed in the model group; there was no obvious damage to neuronal structure, intracellular matrix was abundant, and a few lysosomes existed in the acupuncture group; the neuronal cells had mild edema and primary lysosomes were present in the acupuncture +3-MA group.Acupuncture can improve the symptoms of neurological impairment and reduce the percentage of cerebral ischemic area in rats with CI/RI. The mechanism may be related to regulating type Ⅲ PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway, up-regulating the expressions of autophagy related factors LC3B-Ⅱ and Lamp2, and down-regulating the expression of P62.目的：观察针刺对脑缺血再灌注损伤大鼠缺血侧海马组织Ⅲ型磷脂酰肌醇-3-羟激酶(PI3K)及Beclin-1等自噬相关指标的影响，探讨针刺调控Ⅲ型PI3K/Beclin-1通路适度激活脑缺血再灌注损伤大鼠缺血侧海马神经细胞自噬的作用机制。方法：SD大鼠按照随机数字表法分为假手术组、模型组、针刺组、模型+3-甲基腺嘌呤(3-MA)组、针刺+3-MA组，每组11只。使用改良线栓法制备大鼠大脑中动脉闭塞再灌注模型。模型+3-MA组、针刺+3-MA组于再灌注前30 min予侧脑室注射3-MA 5 μL(400 nmol/5 μL)。针刺组、针刺+3-MA组针刺“大椎”“水沟”“百会”，每15 min捻转1次，留针30 min，每12 h治疗1次，共7次。于再灌注后2 h、干预后进行Garcia神经功能评分，干预后通过TTC染色法观察大鼠脑组织缺血面积百分比，Western blot法检测缺血侧海马组织Ⅲ型PI3K、Beclin-1、自噬标志物微管相关蛋白1轻链3B（LC3B）、溶酶体相关膜蛋白 2(Lamp2)、P62的蛋白表达水平，透射电镜法观察缺血侧海马组织神经细胞超微结构。结果：再灌注后与假手术组比较，其余各组大鼠神经功能评分降低(P<0.01)。与假手术组比较，模型组大鼠神经功能评分显著降低、脑梗死面积百分比升高(P<0.01)，缺血侧海马组织Ⅲ型PI3K、Beclin-1、LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ、Lamp2表达显著降低(P<0.01)，P62表达显著升高(P<0.01)，神经细胞水肿较重。与模型组比较，干预后针刺组神经功能评分升高、脑梗死面积百分比降低(P<0.01)，缺血侧海马组织Ⅲ型PI3K、Beclin-1、LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ、Lamp2表达升高（P<0.01, P<0.05），P62表达降低(P<0.01)，神经元结构未见明显损伤，溶酶体增多；模型+3-MA组脑梗死面积百分比升高(P<0.05)，Ⅲ型PI3K、Beclin-1表达降低(P<0.01)，P62表达水平升高(P<0.05)，神经细胞中重度水肿，初级溶酶体存在。与模型+3-MA组比较，针刺+3-MA组神经功能评分显著升高、脑梗死面积百分比显著降低(P<0.05，P<0.01)，缺血侧海马组织Ⅲ型PI3K、Beclin-1、LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ表达升高(P<0.01，P<0.05)，神经细胞轻度水肿，初级溶酶体存在。与针刺组比较，针刺+3-MA组神经功能评分显著降低、脑梗死面积百分比升高（P<0.05，P<0.01），缺血侧海马组织Ⅲ型PI3K、Beclin-1、Lamp2表达水平降低（P<0.01，P<0.05），P62表达水平升高（P<0.05）。结论：针刺可改善脑缺血再灌注损伤大鼠神经功能缺损症状，减少脑梗死面积，其机制可能与调控Ⅲ型PI3K/Beclin-1通路，上调海马区自噬相关因子 LC3B-Ⅱ/Ⅰ、Lamp2表达，下调P62表达有关。.","['Acupuncture', 'Autophagy', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Type Ⅲ phosphatidylinositol 3-hydrorykinase/Beclin-1 signaling']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37246982,Acid-sensing ion channel 1a exacerbates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury through the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), and there is no effective therapy. Microenvironmental acidification is generally observed in ischemic tissues. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) can be activated by a decrease in extracellular pH which mediates neuronal IRI. Our previous study demonstrated that, ASIC1a inhibition alleviates renal IRI. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we determined that renal tubule-specific deletion of ASIC1a in mice (ASIC1afl/fl/CDH16cre) attenuated renal IRI, and reduced the expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD-N, and IL-1β. Consistent with these in vivo results, inhibition of ASIC1a by the specific inhibitor PcTx-1 protected HK-2 cells from hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury, and suppressed H/R-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, the activation of ASIC1a by either IRI or H/R induced the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, which translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. Blocking NF-κB by treatment with BAY 11-7082 validated the roles of H/R and acidosis in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This further confirmed that ASIC1a promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which requires the NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, our study suggests that ASIC1a contributes to renal IRI by affecting the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Therefore, ASIC1a may be a potential therapeutic target for AKI. KEY MESSAGES: Knockout of ASIC1a attenuated renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. ASIC1a promoted the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inhibition of the NF-κB mitigated the NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by ASIC1a.","['Acid-sensing ion channel 1a', 'Acute kidney injury', 'Ischemia-reperfusion', 'NF-κB', 'NLRP3 inflammasome']",2022-05-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37246844,Circadian and sex differences in post-ischemic vasodilation and reactive hyperemia in young individuals and elderly with and without type 2 diabetes.,"Cardiovascular events show morning preference and sex differences, and are related to aging and type 2 diabetes. We assessed circadian variations and sex differences in vascular conductance (VC) and blood flow (BF) regulations following a brief bout of forearm ischemia.Young healthy individuals (H18-30) and elderly without (H50-80) and with type 2 diabetes (T2DM50-80) of both sexes were included. Forearm VC and BF, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at baseline and following circulatory reperfusion were measured at 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.In the morning compared to evening, following reperfusion, the VC and BF increments were similar in H18-30 (p>.71), but lower in H50-80 (p<.001) and T2DM50-80 (p<.01). VC and BF following circulatory reperfusion were higher in men than women in H18-30 (p<.001), but similar between sexes in the older groups (p>.23).Forearm vasodilation following reperfusion is attenuated in the morning in the elderly, impairing BF towards an ischemic area. Diabetes does not affect the circadian regulation of VC and BF, but that of MAP. There are sex differences in VC and BF at baseline and after circulatory reperfusion at a young age, being greater in men, which disappear with aging without being affected by diabetes.","['aging', 'cardiovascular disease', 'circadian changes', 'diabetes mellitus', 'risk factors', 'sex differences', 'sympathetic activation']",2022-07-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37246833,Hypoxic preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells ameliorate rat brain injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation by suppressing neuronal pyroptosis.,"Cardiac arrest (CA) can result in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury and poor neurological outcomes. While bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been shown to have protective effects in brain ischaemic disease, their efficacy can be reduced by the poor oxygen environment. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of hypoxic preconditioned BMSCs (HP-BMSCs) and normoxic BMSCs C (N-BMSCs) in a cardiac arrest rat model by examining their ability to ameliorate cell pyroptosis. The mechanism underlying the process was also explored. Cardiac arrest was induced in rats for 8 min and surviving rats received 1 × 106 normoxic/hypoxic BMSCs or PBS via intracerebroventricular (ICV) transplantation. Neurological function of rats was evaluated using neurological deficit scores (NDSs) and examined for brain pathology. Serum S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels and cortical proinflammatory cytokines were measured to evaluate brain injury. Pyroptosis-related proteins in the cortex after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were measured using western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Transplanted BMSCs were tracked using bioluminescence imaging. Results showed significantly better neurological function and neuropathological damage after transplantation with HP-BMSCs. In addition, HP-BMSCs reduced levels of pyroptosis-related proteins in the rat cortex after CPR and significantly reduced levels of biomarkers for brain injury. Mechanistically, HP-BMSCs alleviated brain injury by reducing the expressions of HMGB1, TLR4, NF-κB p65, p38 MAPK and JNK in the cortex. Our study demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning could enhance the efficacy of BMSCs in alleviating post-resuscitation cortical pyroptosis. This effect may be related to the regulation of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB, MAPK signalling pathways.","['HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB', 'MAPK', 'bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells', 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'hypoxic preconditioning', 'pyroptosis']",2023-01-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37246769,A Pilot Study of Ratiometric Creatine CEST MRI Assessment of Rabbit Skeletal Muscle Energy Metabolism at 3 T.,"pH MRI may provide useful information to evaluate metabolic disruption following ischemia. Radiofrequency amplitude-based creatine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CrCEST) ratiometric MRI is pH-sensitive, which could but has not been explored to examine muscle ischemia.To investigate skeletal muscle energy metabolism alterations with CrCEST ratiometric MRI.Prospective.Seven adult New Zealand rabbits with ipsilateral hindlimb muscle ischemia.3 T/two MRI scans, including MRA and CEST imaging, were performed under two B1 amplitudes of 0.5 and 1.25 μT after 2 hours of hindlimb muscle ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion recovery, respectively.CEST effects of two energy metabolites of creatine and phosphocreatine (PCrCEST) were resolved with the multipool Lorentzian fitting approach. The pixel-wise CrCEST ratio was quantified by calculating the ratio of the resolved CrCEST peaks under a B1 amplitude of 1.25 μT to those under 0.5 μT in the entire muscle.One-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.MRA images confirmed the blood flow loss and restoration in the ischemic hindlimb at the ischemia and recovery phases, respectively. Ischemic muscles exhibited a significant decrease of PCr at the ischemia (under both B1 amplitudes) and recovery phases (under B1 amplitude of 0.5 μT) and significantly increased CrCEST from normal tissues at both phases (under both B1 levels). Specifically, CrCEST decreased, and PCrCEST increased with the CrCEST ratio. Significantly strong correlations were observed among the CrCEST ratio, and CrCEST and PCrCEST under both B1 levels (r > 0.80).The CrCEST ratio altered substantially with muscle pathological states and was closely related to CEST effects of energy metabolites of Cr and PCr, suggesting that the pH-sensitive CrCEST ratiometric MRI is feasible to evaluate muscle injuries at the metabolic level.2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY STAGE: 1.","['chemical exchange saturation transfer', 'energy metabolism', 'pH', 'ratiometric imaging']",2023-04-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37246731,Exploratory metabolomic analysis based on UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS to study hypoxia-reoxygenation energy metabolic alterations in HK-2 cells.,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury(IRI)is a major cause of acute kidney injury(AKI), the injury and repair of renal tubular epithelial cells play an important role in the pathological process of IR-AKI. Metabolomics was used to detect cell metabolism alterations and metabolic reprogramming in the initial injury, peak injury, and recovery stage of human renal proximal tubular cells (HK-2 cells) to provide insights into clinical prevention and treatment of IRI-induced AKI.An in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (H/R) injury and the recovery model of HK-2 cells were established at different times of hypoxia/reoxygenation. Comprehensive detection of metabolic alterations in HK-2 cells after H/R induction by nontarget metabolomics. Interconversion of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in HK-2 cells after H/R induction was examined by western blotting and qRT-PCR.Multivariate data analysis found significant differences among the groups, with significant changes in metabolites such as glutamate, malate, aspartate, and L-palmitoylcarnitine. Hypoxia-reoxygenated HK-2 cells are accompanied by altered metabolisms such as disturbance of amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, dysregulation of lipid metabolism, increased glycolysis, and metabolic reprogramming, which manifests as a shift in energy metabolism from FAO to glycolysis.The development of IRI-induced AKI in HK-2 cells is accompanied by the disturbance of amino acid, nucleotide, and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism and specifically metabolic reprogramming of FAO to glycolytic conversion. The timely recovery of energy metabolism in HK-2 cells is of great significance for treating and prognosis IRI-induced AKI.","['Metabolomics', 'acute kidney injury', 'glycolysis', 'metabolic pathways', 'metabolic reprogramming']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37246314,Improved catheter delivery for aspiration thrombectomy using Tenzing 7 ledge reducing catheter and FreeClimb 70.,"Previous comparative mechanical thrombectomy device trials reported a substantial crossover rate from first-line aspiration to stent-retriever thrombectomy. A specialized delivery catheter may help track large-bore aspiration catheters to target occlusions. We report our multicenter experience of aspiration thrombectomy of intracranial large vessel occlusions using the FreeClimbTM 70 and Tenzing® 7 delivery catheter (Route 92, San Mateo, CA).After local Institutional Review Board approval, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical, procedural, and imaging data of patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with the FreeClimb 70 and Tenzing 7.FreeClimb 70 was successfully delivered using Tenzing 7 to target occlusion in 30/30 (100%) patients (18 M1, 6 M2, 4 ICA-terminus, and 2 basilar artery occlusions), without the use of a stent-retriever for anchoring. In 21/30 (70%) cases, a leading microwire was not needed to advance the Tenzing 7 to the target. Median (interquartile range) time from groin puncture to first pass was 12 (interquartile range 8-15) minutes. Overall first pass effect, or first pass effect (modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2C-3), was achieved 16/30 (53%). For M1 occlusions, first pass effect was 11/18 (61%). Successful reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia ≥ 2B) was achieved in 29/30 (97%) cases after a median of 1 pass (interquartile range 1-3). Median groin puncture to reperfusion time was 16 (interquartile range 12-26) minutes. There were no procedural complications or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Average improvement in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at discharge was 6.6  ±  7.1. There were three patient deaths (renal failure, respiratory failure, and comfort care).Initial data support the use of Tenzing 7 with FreeClimb 70 catheter for reliable access to rapid, effective, and safe aspiration thrombectomy of large vessel occlusions.","['Thrombectomy', 'aspiration', 'catheter', 'ischemic stroke']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37245860,Berberine modulates gut microbiota to attenuate cerebral ferroptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion in mice.,"Ferroptosis was reported to be involved in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI), on which the effects of berberine (BBR) remain unclear. Moreover, based on the critical role of gut microbiota in pleiotropic actions of BBR, we hypothesized that BBR can suppress CIRI-induced ferroptosis by modulating the gut microbiota. In this study, the results showed that BBR obviously attenuated the behavioral deficits of CIRI mice, accompanied with the improved survival rate and neuron damages, as phenocopied by dirty cage experiment. The typical morphological changes in ferroptotic cells and biomarkers of ferroptosis were attenuated in BBR- and its fecal microbiota-treated mice, accompanied by reduced malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species, and the increased glutathione (GSH). BBR was found to alter the gut microbiota of CIRI mice with decreased abundance of Muribaculaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Helicobacteraceae, Streptococcaceae and Tannerellaceae, but elevated Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. KEGG analysis based on the 16S rRNA results indicated that multiple metabolic pathways including ferroptosis and GSH metabolism, were altered by BBR. Oppositely, the antibiotics administration counteracted the protective properties of BBR. Summarily, this study revealed the therapeutic potential of BBR on CIRI via inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis, in which upregulated glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) was possibly involved. Moreover, the BBR-modulated gut microbiota was shown to play the critical role in the underlying mechanism.","['Berberine', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Ferroptosis', 'GPXs', 'Lipid peroxidation', 'Microbiota-gut-brain axis']",2023-02-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37245722,The Apelin-Apela Receptor APJ is Necessary for Formation and Healing of Ischemia Reperfusion-Induced Gastric Ulcer in Rats.,"The apelinergic system, widely expressed and regulates hormone-enzyme secretion, motility, and protective mechanisms of the stomach. This system consists of the apelin receptor (APJ) and two peptides known as apela and apelin. The IR-induced experimental gastric ulcer model, is a well-known and commonly used one that induces hypoxia and causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Expressions of apelin and its receptor APJ are induced by hypoxia and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Apelin has been shown to affect angiogenesis positively, considered the most critical component of the healing process. Although it is known that apelin and AJP expressions are induced by inflammatory stimuli and hypoxia, stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and have a role in regenerative angiogenesis, no information or has been found in the literature regarding the role of APJ in the formation and healing of gastric mucosal lesions induced by I/R. So, we conducted a study to clarify the role of APJ in formation and healing mechanisms of IR-induced gastric lesions. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups; control, sham-operated, IR, APJ antagonist treated-IR group (F13A+IR), and the healing groups. F13A was intravenously given to the animals. Gastric lesion index, mucosal blood flow, PGE2, NOx, 4-HNE-MDA, HO activity, and protein expressions of VEGF and HO-1 were measured. F13A application before the IR increased the mucosal injury, F13A application following the ischemia delayed the mucosal healing during the reperfusion period. Consequently, blocking apelin receptors may worsen gastric injury due to the IR and delay mucosal healing.","['APJ', 'F13A', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'apelinergic system', 'gastroprotection', 'mucosal healing']",2023-03-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37244563,"Long-term Effects of Prenatal Arsenic Exposure from Gestational Day 9 to Birth on Lung, Heart, and Immune Outcomes in the C57BL/6 Mouse Model.","Prenatal arsenic exposure is a major public health concern, associated with altered birth outcomes and increased respiratory disease risk. However, characterization of the long-term effects of mid-pregnancy (second trimester) arsenic exposure on multiple organ systems is scant. This study aimed to characterize the long-term impact of mid-pregnancy inorganic arsenic exposure on the lung, heart, and immune system, including infectious disease response using the C57BL/6 mouse model. Mice were exposed from gestational day 9 till birth to either 0 or 1000µg/L sodium (meta)arsenite in drinking water. Male and female offspring assessed at adulthood (10-12 weeks of age) did not show significant effects on recovery outcomes after ischemia reperfusion injury but did exhibit increased airway hyperresponsiveness compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significantly greater total numbers of cells in arsenic-exposed lungs, lower MHCII expression in natural killer cells, and increased percentages of dendritic cell populations. Activated interstitial (IMs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) isolated from arsenic-exposed male mice produced significantly less IFN-γ than controls. Conversely, activated AMs from arsenic-exposed females produced significantly more IFN-γ than controls. Although systemic cytokine levels were higher upon Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in prenatally arsenic-exposed offspring there was no difference in lung Mtb burden compared to controls. This study highlights significant long-term impacts of prenatal arsenic exposure on lung and immune cell function. These effects may contribute to the elevated risk of respiratory diseases associated with prenatal arsenic exposure in epidemiology studies and point to the need for more research into mechanisms driving these maintained responses.","['animal model', 'arsenic', 'developmental (or pregnancy)', 'immunotoxicity']",2022-10-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37244481,Necrostatin-1 attenuates delayed paraplegia after transient spinal cord ischemia in rabbits by inhibiting the upregulation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 and 3.,"Delayed-onset paraplegia is a disastrous complication after thoracoabdominal aortic open surgery and thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Studies have revealed that transient spinal cord ischemia caused by temporary occlusion of the aorta induces delayed motor neuron death owing to apoptosis and necroptosis. Recently, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), a necroptosis inhibitor, has been reported to reduce cerebral and myocardial infarction in rats or pigs. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Nec-1 in delayed paraplegia after transient spinal cord ischemia in rabbits and assessed the expression of necroptosis- and apoptosis-related proteins in motor neurons.This study used rabbit transient spinal cord ischemia models using a balloon catheter. They were divided into a vehicle-treated group (n = 24), Nec-1-treated group (n = 24), and sham-controls (n = 6). In the Nec-1-treated group, 1 mg/kg Nec-1 was intravascularly administered immediately before ischemia induction. Neurological function was assessed using the modified Tarlov score, and the spinal cord was removed 8 h and 1, 2, and 7 days after reperfusion. Morphological changes were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The expression levels of necroptosis-related proteins (receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP) 1 and 3) and apoptosis-related proteins (Bax and caspase-8) were assessed using western blotting and histochemical analysis. We also performed double-fluorescence immunohistochemical studies of RIP1, RIP3, Bax and caspase-8.Neurological function significantly improved in the Nec-1-treated group compared with that in the vehicle-treated group 7 days after reperfusion (median 3 and 0, p = 0.025). Motor neurons observed 7 days after reperfusion were significantly decreased in both groups compared with in the sham group (vehicle-treated, p < 0.001; Nec-1-treated, p < 0.001). However, significantly more motor neurons survived in the Nec-1-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group (p < 0.001). Western blot analysis revealed RIP1, RIP3, Bax, and caspase-8 upregulation 8 h after reperfusion in the vehicle-treated group (RIP1, p = 0.001; RIP3, p = 0.045; Bax, p = 0.042; caspase-8, p = 0.047). In the Nec-1-treated group, the upregulation of RIP1 and RIP3 was not observed in any time point, whereas that of Bax and caspase-8 was observed 8 h after reperfusion (Bax, p = 0.029; caspase-8, p = 0.021). Immunohistochemical study revealed the immunoreactivity of these proteins in motor neurons. Double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed the induction of RIP1 and RIP3, and that of Bax and caspase-8 in the same motor neurons.These data suggest that Nec-1 reduces delayed motor neuron death and attenuates delayed paraplegia after transient spinal cord ischemia in rabbits by selectively inhibiting necroptosis of motor neurons, with minimal effect on their apoptosis.","['apoptosis', 'necroptosis', 'necrostatin-1', 'paraplegia', 'spinal cord ischemia']",2023-03-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37244471,Tolerogenic dendritic cells protect against acute kidney injury.,"Ischemia reperfusion injury is a common precipitant of acute kidney injury that occurs following disrupted perfusion to the kidney. This includes blood loss and hemodynamic shock, as well as during retrieval for deceased donor kidney transplantation. Acute kidney injury is associated with adverse long-term clinical outcomes and requires effective interventions that can modify the disease process. Immunomodulatory cell therapies such as tolerogenic dendritic cells remain a promising tool, and here we tested the hypothesis that adoptively transferred tolerogenic dendritic cells can limit kidney injury. The phenotypic and genomic signatures of bone marrow-derived syngeneic or allogeneic, Vitamin-D3/IL-10 conditioned tolerogenic dendritic cells were assessed. These cells were characterized by high PD-L1:CD86, elevated IL-10, restricted IL-12p70 secretion and a suppressed transcriptomic inflammatory profile. When infused systemically, these cells successfully abrogated kidney injury without modifying infiltrating inflammatory cell populations. They also provided protection against ischemia reperfusion injury in mice pre-treated with liposomal clodronate, suggesting the process was regulated by live, rather than reprocessed cells. Co-culture experiments and spatial transcriptomic analysis confirmed reduced kidney tubular epithelial cell injury. Thus, our data provide strong evidence that peri-operatively administered tolerogenic dendritic cells have the ability to protect against acute kidney injury and warrants further exploration as a therapeutic option. This technology may provide a clinical advantage for bench-to-bedside translation to affect patient outcomes.","['Tolerogenic', 'acute kidney injury', 'dendritic cell', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'kidney']",2022-05-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37243945,Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells alleviate biliary ischemia reperfusion injury in fatty liver transplantation by inhibiting ferroptosis.,"Fatty liver grafts are susceptible to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), increasing the risk of biliary complications after liver transplantation (LT). Ferroptosis, a newly recognized programmed cell death, is expected to be a novel therapeutic target for IRI. We investigated whether exosomes derived from heme oxygenase 1-modified bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HExos) relieve ferroptosis and protect biliary tracts from IRI in a rat fatty liver transplantation model. Rats were fed with a methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet for 2 weeks to induce severe hepatic steatosis. Steatotic grafts were implanted and HExos were administered after liver transplantation. A series of functional assays and pathological analysis were performed to assess ferroptosis and biliary IRI. The HExos attenuated IRI following liver transplantation, as demonstrated by less ferroptosis, improved liver function, less Kupffer and T cell activation, and less long-term biliary fibrosis. MicroRNA (miR)-204-5p delivered by HExos negatively regulated ferroptosis by targeting a key pro-ferroptosis enzyme, ACSL4. Ferroptosis contributes to biliary IRI in fatty liver transplantation. HExos protect steatotic grafts by inhibiting ferroptosis, and may become a promising strategy to prevent biliary IRI and expand the donor pool.","['Exosome', 'Ferroptosis', 'Liver transplantation', 'Mesenchymal stem cell']",2023-04-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to be immunomodulatory, antioxidative and contribute to liver regeneration in fulminant hepatic failure. We aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which MSCs protect against liver IR injury in a mouse model.MSCs suspension was injected 30 min prior to hepatic warm IR. Primary kupffer cells (KCs) were isolated. Hepatic injury, inflammatory responses, innate immunity, KCs phenotypic polarization and mitochondrial dynamics were evaluated with or without KCs Drp-1 overexpression RESULTS: MSCs markedly ameliorated liver injury and attenuated inflammatory responses and innate immunity after liver IR injury. MSCs significantly restrained M1 phenotypic polarization but boosted M2 polarization of KCs extracted from ischemic liver, as demonstrated by lowered transcript levels of iNOS and IL-1β but raised transcript levels of Mrc-1 and Arg-1 combined with p-STAT6 up-regulation and p-STAT1 down-regulation. Moreover, MSCs inhibited KCs mitochondrial fission, as evidenced by decreased Drp1 and Dnm2 levels. We overexpressed Drp-1 in KCs which promote mitochondrial fission during IR injury. the regulation of MSCs towards KCs M1/M2 polarization was abrogated by Drp-1 overexpression after IR injury. Ultimately, in vivo Drp-1 overexpression in KCs hampered the therapeutic effects of MSCs against hepatic IR injury CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that MSCs facilitated M1-M2 phenotypic polarization through inhibiting Drp-1 dependent mitochondrial fission and further attenuated liver IR injury. These results add a new insight into regulating mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics during hepatic IR injury and may offer novel opportunities for developing therapeutic targets to combat hepatic IR injury.","['Drp-1', 'Liver ischemia and reperfusion injury', 'Macrophage', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Mitochondria dynamics']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37243806,Immp2l Mutation Induces Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization and Complex III Activity Suppression after Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Mice.,"We previously reported that mutations in inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase 2-like (Immp2l) increase infarct volume, enhance superoxide production, and suppress mitochondrial respiration after transient cerebral focal ischemia and reperfusion injury. The present study investigated the impact of heterozygous Immp2l mutation on mitochondria function after ischemia and reperfusion injury in mice.Mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h followed by 0, 1, 5, and 24 h of reperfusion. The effects of Immp2l+/- on mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiratory complex III activity, caspase-3, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation were examined.Immp2l+/- increased ischemic brain damage and the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared with wild-type mice. Immp2l+/- led to mitochondrial damage, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, mitochondrial respiratory complex III activity suppression, caspase-3 activation, and AIF nuclear translocation.The adverse impact of Immp2l+/- on the brain after ischemia and reperfusion might be related to mitochondrial damage that involves depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory complex III, and activation of mitochondria-mediated cell death pathways. These results suggest that patients with stroke carrying Immp2l+/- might have worse and more severe infarcts, followed by a worse prognosis than those without Immp2l mutations.","['apoptosis', 'cerebral ischemia', 'inner mitochondrial membrane peptidase 2-like', 'mitochondrial complex III', 'mitochondrial membrane potential']",2022-05-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37243325,A single administration of FGF2 after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury alleviates post-injury interstitial fibrosis.,"Despite lack of clinical therapy in acute kidney injury (AKI) or its progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD), administration of growth factors shows great potential in the treatment of renal repair and further fibrosis. At early phase of AKI, administration of exogenous fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) protects against renal injury by inhibition of mitochondrial damage and inflammatory response. Here, we investigated whether this treatment attenuates the long-term renal interstitial fibrosis induced by I/R injury.Unilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) with contralateral nephrectomy was utilized as an in vivo model for AKI and subsequent CKD. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: Sham-operation group, I/R group, I/R-FGF2 group and FGF2-3D group. These groups were monitored for up to 2 months. Serum creatinine, inflammatory response and renal histopathology changes were detected to evaluate the role of FGF2 in AKI and followed renal interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, the expression of vimentin, α-SMA, CD31 and CD34 were examined.Two months after I/R injury, the severity of renal interstitial fibrosis was significantly attenuated in both of I/R-FGF2 group and FGF2-3D group, compared with I/R group. The protective effects of FGF2 administration were associated with the reduction of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) mediated inflammatory response, the inhibition of TGF-β1/Smads signaling induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the maintenance of peritubular capillary structure.A single dose of exogenous FGF2 administration 1 hour or 3 days after reperfusion inhibited renal fibrogenesis and thus blocked the transition of AKI to CKD. Our findings provided novel insight into the role of FGF signaling in AKI to CKD progression and underscored potential of FGF based therapy for this devastating disease.","['AKI', 'CKD', 'FGF2', 'myofibroblast', 'renal fibrosis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37242611,Fluoxetine Protects Retinal Ischemic Damage in Mice.,"To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of the topical ocular administration of fluoxetine (FLX) in a mouse model of acute retinal damage.Ocular ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in C57BL/6J mice was used to elicit retinal damage. Mice were divided into three groups: control group, I/R group, and I/R group treated with topical FLX. A pattern electroretinogram (PERG) was used as a sensitive measure of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) function. Finally, we analyzed the retinal mRNA expression of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, Iba-1, IL-1β, and S100β) through Digital Droplet PCR.PERG amplitude values were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the I/R-FLX group compared to the I/R group, whereas PERG latency values were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in I/R-FLX-treated mice compared to the I/R group. Retinal inflammatory markers increased significantly (p < 0.05) after I/R injury. FLX treatment was able to significantly (p < 0.05) attenuate the expression of inflammatory markers after I/R damage.Topical treatment with FLX was effective in counteracting the damage of RGCs and preserving retinal function. Moreover, FLX treatment attenuates the production of pro-inflammatory molecules elicited by retinal I/R damage. Further studies need to be performed to support the use of FLX as neuroprotective agent in retinal degenerative diseases.","['fluoxetine', 'ischemia reperfusion', 'neuroprotection', 'retinal ganglion cells']",2023-04-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37242521,Natural Products Targeting PI3K/AKT in Myocardial Ischemic Reperfusion Injury: A Scoping Review.,"This scoping review aimed to summarize the effects of natural products targeting phosphoinositide-3-kinases/serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). The review details various types of natural compounds such as gypenoside (GP), gypenoside XVII (GP-17), geniposide, berberine, dihydroquercetin (DHQ), and tilianin which identified to reduce MIRI in vitro and in vivo by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In this study, 14 research publications that met the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria were shortlisted. Following the intervention, we discovered that natural products effectively improved cardiac functions through regulation of antioxidant status, down-regulation of Bax, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 and caspases cleavage. Furthermore, although comparing outcomes can be challenging due to the heterogeneity in the study model, the results we assembled here were consistent, giving us confidence in the intervention's efficacy. We also discussed if MIRI is associated with multiple pathological condition such as oxidative stress, ERS, mitochondrial injury, inflammation, and apoptosis. This brief review provides evidence to support the huge potential of natural products used in the treatment of MIRI due to their various biological activities and drug-like properties.","['PI3K/AKT', 'cardiovascular disease', 'medicinal plants', 'myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury', 'phytochemicals']",2023-03-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37241906,"Purification, Structural Analysis and Cardio-Protective Activity of Polysaccharides from Radix Astragali.","Two polysaccharides, named APS2-I and APS3-I, were purified from the water extract of Radix Astragali. The average molecular weight of APS2-I was 1.96 × 106 Da and composed of Man, Rha, GlcA, GalA, Glc, Gal, Xyl, and Ara in a molar ratio of 2.3:4.8:1.7:14.0:5.8:11.7:2.8:12.6, while the average molecular weight of APS3-I was 3.91 × 106 Da and composed of Rha, GalA, Glc, Gal, and Ara in a molar ratio of 0.8:2.3:0.8:2.3:4.1. Biological evaluation showed APS2-I and APS3-I had significant antioxidant activity and myocardial protection activity. Furthermore, total polysaccharide treatment could significantly enhance hemodynamic parameters and improve cardiac function in rat ischemia and reperfusion isolated heart models. These results provided important information for the clinical application of APS in the field of cardiovascular disease and implied that Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) could be considered as a reference for the quality control of Radix Astragali.","['Astragalus membranaceus', 'antioxidant', 'cardio-protection', 'polysaccharide']",2023-04-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37241859,Salvianolic Acid B Inhibits Ferroptosis and Apoptosis during Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Decreasing the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Degradation of GPX4 and the ROS-JNK/MAPK Pathways.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is related to ferroptosis and apoptosis elicited by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this research, we investigated the protective effect of salvianolic acid B (SAB) as a natural antioxidant on ferroptosis and apoptosis in the MIRI process, and discussed the protective mechanism inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) apoptosis signal pathway. We observed that ferroptosis and apoptosis occurred in the MIRI rat model in vivo and the H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) damage model in vitro. SAB can alleviate tissue damage related to ROS, ferroptosis and apoptosis. Ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of GPX4 occurred in H/R models, and SAB reduced the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of GPX4. SAB downregulates JNK phosphorylation and the expression of BCL2-Associated X (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Caspase-3 to inhibit apoptosis. The role of GPX4 in the cardioprotection of SAB was further verified by the elimination effect of the GPX4 inhibitor RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3). This research shows that SAB may be used as a myocardial protective agent against oxidative stress, ferroptosis and apoptosis, and has potential clinical application prospects.","['GPX4', 'apoptosis', 'ferroptosis', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI)', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'salvianolic acid B']",2022-12-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37240873,Impact of Hypothermic Oxygenated Machine Perfusion on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence after Liver Transplantation.,"Machine perfusion may be able to mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which increases hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT). This study aimed to investigate the impact of dual-hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion (D-HOPE) on HCC recurrence in LT.A single-center retrospective study was conducted from 2016 to 2020. Pre- and postoperative data of HCC patients undergoing LT were analyzed. Recipients of a D-HOPE-treated graft were compared to those of livers preserved using static cold storage (SCS). The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS).Of 326 patients, 246 received an SCS-preserved liver and 80 received a D-HOPE-treated graft (donation after brain death (DBD), n = 66; donation after circulatory death (DCD), n = 14). Donors of D-HOPE-treated grafts were older and had higher BMI. All DCD donors were treated by normothermic regional perfusion and D-HOPE. The groups were comparable in terms of HCC features and estimated 5-year RFS according to the Metroticket 2.0 model. D-HOPE did not reduce HCC recurrence (D-HOPE 10%; SCS 8.9%; p = 0.95), which was confirmed using Bayesian model averaging and inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted RFS analysis. Postoperative outcomes were comparable between groups, except for lower AST and ALT peak in the D-HOPE group.In this single-center study, D-HOPE did not reduce HCC recurrence but allowed utilizing livers from extended criteria donors with comparable outcomes, improving access to LT for patients suffering from HCC.","['hepatocellular carcinoma', 'hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'tumor recurrence']",2023-03-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37240675,Comparison of Different Ex-Vivo Preservation Strategies on Cardiac Metabolism in an Animal Model of Donation after Circulatory Death.,"Transplantation of heart following donation after circulatory death (DCD) was recently introduced into clinical practice. Ex vivo reperfusion following DCD and retrieval is deemed necessary in order to evaluate the recovery of cardiac viability after the period of warm ischemia. We tested the effect of four different temperatures (4 °C-18 °C-25 °C-35 °C) on cardiac metabolism during 3-h ex vivo reperfusion in a porcine model of DCD heart. We observed a steep fall in high-energy phosphate (ATP) concentrations in the myocardial tissue at the end of the warm ischemic time and only limited regeneration during reperfusion. Lactate concentration in the perfusate increased rapidly during the first hour of reperfusion and slowly decreased afterward. However, the temperature of the solution does not seem to have an effect on either ATP or lactate concentration. Furthermore, all cardiac allografts showed a significant weight increase due to cardiac edema, regardless of the temperature.","['donation after circulatory death', 'ex-vivo machine perfusion', 'heart transplant']",2023-04-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37240345,Single-Dose Treatment with Rapamycin Preserves Post-Ischemic Cardiac Function through Attenuation of Fibrosis and Inflammation in Diabetic Rabbit.,"Robust activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling in diabetes exacerbates myocardial injury following lethal ischemia due to accelerated cardiomyocyte death with cardiac remodeling and inflammatory responses. We examined the effect of rapamycin (RAPA, mTOR inhibitor) on cardiac remodeling and inflammation following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic rabbits. Diabetic rabbits (DM) were subjected to 45 min of ischemia and 10 days of reperfusion by inflating/deflating a previously implanted hydraulic balloon occluder. RAPA (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) or DMSO (vehicle) was infused 5 min before the onset of reperfusion. Post-I/R left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography and fibrosis was evaluated by picrosirius red staining. Treatment with RAPA preserved LV ejection fraction and reduced fibrosis. Immunoblot and real-time PCR revealed that RAPA treatment inhibited several fibrosis markers (TGF-β, Galectin-3, MYH, p-SMAD). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed the attenuation of post-I/R NLRP3-inflammasome formation with RAPA treatment as shown by reduced aggregation of apoptosis speck-like protein with a caspase recruitment domain and active-form of caspase-1 in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our study suggests that acute reperfusion therapy with RAPA may be a viable strategy to preserve cardiac function with the alleviation of adverse post-infarct myocardial remodeling and inflammation in diabetic patients.","['diabetes', 'fibrosis', 'inflammation', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'mTOR', 'rapamycin']",2023-04-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Recent studies have reported that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs) play an important role in repairing organ and tissue injuries because of their unique characteristics. However, the potential of HucMSC extracellular vesicles (HucMSC-EVs) to promote the repair of renal tubular cells remains to be explored. This study found that HucMSC-EVs derived from HucMSCs played a protective role and were associated with kidney I/R injury. We found that miR-148b-3p in HucMSC-EVs had a protective effect against kidney I/R injury. HK-2 cells overexpressing miR-148b-3p were protected against I/R injury by inhibiting apoptosis. Next, the target mRNA of miR-148b-3p was predicted online, and the target mRNA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), was identified and verified using dual luciferase. We discovered that I/R injury significantly increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, whereas siR-PDK4 inhibited these effects and protected against I/R injury. Interestingly, after administrating HucMSC-EVs to HK-2 cells, PDK4 expression and ER stress induced by I/R injury were significantly inhibited. HK-2 ingested miR-148b-3p from HucMSC-EVs, and its ER induced by I/R injury was significantly deregulated. This study suggests that HucMSC-EVs protect kidneys from I/R injury during the early I/R stage. These results suggest a new mechanism for HucMSC-EVs in treating AKI and provide a new treatment strategy for I/R injury.","['MicroRNA', 'apoptosis', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'extracellular vesicles', 'human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury']",2023-03-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37240000,Nanoemulsions of Hydroxysafflor Yellow A for Enhancing Physicochemical and In Vivo Performance.,"Stroke was always a disease that threatened human life and health worldwide. We reported the synthesis of a new type of hyaluronic acid-modified multi-walled carbon nanotube. Then, we produced hydroxysafflor yellow A-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin phospholipid complex water-in-oil nanoemulsion with hyaluronic acid-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes and chitosan (HC@HMC) for oral treatment of an ischemic stroke. We measured the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetics of HC@HMC in rats. We found that the intestinal absorption and the pharmacokinetic behavior of HC@HMC was superior to that of HYA. We measured intracerebral concentrations after oral administration of HC@HMC and found that more HYA crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of HC@HMC in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injured mice. In MCAO/R mice, oral administration of HC@HMC demonstrated significant protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Furthermore, we found HC@HMC may exert a protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through the COX2/PGD2/DPs pathway. These results suggest that oral administration of HC@HMC may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stroke.","['cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'hydroxysafflor yellow A', 'nanoparticle', 'oral administration']",2023-03-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cardiomyocytes have a high density of mitochondria and mitochondrial damage is present in a variety of cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we describe mitochondrial damage in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, coronary heart disease, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, and drug-induced cardiotoxicity, in the context of the key roles of mitochondria in cardiac development and homeostasis. Finally, we discuss the main current therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating mitochondrial impairment-related cardiac dysfunction, including pharmacological strategies, gene therapy, mitochondrial replacement therapy, and mitochondrial transplantation. It is hoped that this will provide new ideas for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.","['cardiomyocytes', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'mitochondria', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria']",2023-03-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37238988,Biomarkers of Spinal Cord Injury in Patients Undergoing Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair Procedures-A Narrative Review of Current Literature.,"Complex endovascular aortic repair (coEVAR) of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) has greatly evolved in the past decades. Despite substantial improvements of postoperative care, spinal cord injury (SCI) remains the most devastating complication of coEVAR being associated with impaired patient outcome and having an impact on long-term survival. The rising number of challenges of coEVAR, essentially associated with an extensive coverage of critical blood vessels supplying the spinal cord, resulted in the implementation of dedicated SCI prevention protocols. In addition to maintenance of adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP), early detection of SCI plays an integral role in intra- and postoperative patient care. However, this is challenging due to difficulties with clinical neurological examinations during patient sedation in the postoperative setting. There is a rising amount of evidence, suggesting that subclinical forms of SCI might be accompanied by an elevation of biochemical markers, specific to neuronal tissue damage. Addressing this hypothesis, several studies have attempted to assess the potential of selected biomarkers with regard to early SCI diagnosis. In this review, we discuss biomarkers measured in patients undergoing coEVAR. Once validated in future prospective clinical studies, biomarkers of neuronal tissue damage may potentially add to the armamentarium of modalities for early SCI diagnosis and risk stratification.","['S100 calcium-binding protein β', 'biomarkers', 'complex abdominal aortic aneurysm', 'endovascular aortic repair', 'glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'neurofilament light (NFL)', 'neuron specific enolase (NSE)', 'spinal cord ischemia', 'thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm']",2023-03-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37238692,"The Induction Mechanism of Ferroptosis, Necroptosis, and Pyroptosis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Colorectal Cancer, and Intestinal Injury.","Cell death includes programmed and nonprogrammed cell death. The former mainly includes ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis, while the latter refers to necrosis. Accumulating evidence shows that ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis play essential regulatory roles in the development of intestinal diseases. In recent years, the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), and intestinal injury induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), sepsis, and radiation have gradually increased, posing a significant threat to human health. The advancement in targeted therapies for intestinal diseases based on ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis provides new strategies for treating intestinal diseases. Herein, we review ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis with respect to intestinal disease regulation and highlight the underlying molecular mechanisms for potential therapeutic applications.","['colorectal cancer', 'ferroptosis', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'intestinal injury', 'necroptosis', 'pyroptosis']",2023-02-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37237948,Aucubin Exerts Neuroprotection against Forebrain Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury in Gerbils through Antioxidative and Neurotrophic Effects.,"Aucubin is an iridoid glycoside that displays various pharmacological actions including antioxidant activity. However, there are few reports available on the neuroprotective effects of aucubin against ischemic brain injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether aucubin protected against damage to hippocampal function induced by forebrain ischemia-reperfusion injury (fIRI) in gerbils, and to examine whether aucubin produced neuroprotection in the hippocampus against fIRI and to explore its mechanisms by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western analysis. Gerbils were given intraperitoneal injections of aucubin at doses of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, once a day for seven days before fIRI. As assessed by the passive avoidance test, short-term memory function following fIRI significantly declined, whereas the decline in short-term memory function due to fIRI was ameliorated by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg, but not 1 or 5 mg/kg, of aucubin. Most of the pyramidal cells (principal cells) of the hippocampus died in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) area four days after fIRI. Treatment with 10 mg/kg, but not 1 or 5 mg/kg, of aucubin protected the pyramidal cells from IRI. The treatment with 10 mg/kg of aucubin significantly reduced IRI-induced superoxide anion production, oxidative DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation in the CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, the aucubin treatment significantly increased the expressions of superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2) in the pyramidal cells before and after fIRI. Furthermore, the aucubin treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression levels of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor-I, in the hippocampal CA1 area before and after IRI. Collectively, in this experiment, pretreatment with aucubin protected CA1 pyramidal cells from forebrain IRI by attenuating oxidative stress and increasing neurotrophic factors. Thus, pretreatment with aucubin can be a promising candidate for preventing brain IRI.","['aucubin', 'hippocampus', 'histopathology', 'immunohistochemistry', 'oxidative stress', 'transient ischemia', 'western blotting']",2023-04-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37237867,Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress Mediates Bradyarrhythmia in Leigh Syndrome Mitochondrial Disease Mice.,"Mitochondrial oxidative stress has been implicated in aging and several cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, and atrial fibrillation. The role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in bradyarrhythmia is less clear. Mice with a germline deletion of Ndufs4 subunit respiratory complex I develop severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy resembling Leigh Syndrome (LS). Several types of cardiac bradyarrhythmia are present in LS mice, including a frequent sinus node dysfunction and episodic atrioventricular (AV) block. Treatment with the mitochondrial antioxidant Mitotempo or mitochondrial protective peptide SS31 significantly ameliorated the bradyarrhythmia and extended the lifespan of LS mice. Using an ex vivo Langendorff perfused heart with live confocal imaging of mitochondrial and total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), we showed increased ROS in the LS heart, which was potentiated by ischemia-reperfusion. A simultaneous ECG recording showed a sinus node dysfunction and AV block concurrent with the severity of the oxidative stress. Treatment with Mitotempo abolished ROS and restored the sinus rhythm. Our study reveals robust evidence of the direct mechanistic roles of mitochondrial and total ROS in bradyarrhythmia in the setting of LS mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Our study also supports the potential clinical application of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants or SS31 for the treatment of LS patients.","['Leigh Syndrome', 'arrhythmia', 'bradycardia', 'cardiomyopathy', 'mitochondria', 'oxidative stress']",2023-02-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37237865,Epimedium Aqueous Extract Ameliorates Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury through Inhibiting ROS/NLRP3-Mediated Pyroptosis.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion causes exacerbated neuronal damage involving excessive neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. ROS is considered a signal molecule to activate NLRP3; thus, the ROS/NLRP3/pyroptosis axis plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). Therefore, targeting the inhibition of the ROS/NLRP3/pyroptosis axis may be a promising therapeutic tactic for CIRI. Epimedium (EP) contains many active ingredients (ICA, ICS II, and ICT), which have a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, whether EP can protect against CIRI remains unknown. Thus, in this study, we designed to investigate the effect and possible underlying mechanism of EP on CIRI. The results showed that treatment with EP dramatically mitigated brain damage in rats following CIRI, which was achieved by suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we identified the ROS/NLRP3/pyroptosis axis as a vital process and NLRP3 as a vital target in EP-mediated protection. Most interestingly, the main compounds of EP directly bonded with NLRP3, as reflected by molecular docking, which indicated that NLRP3 might be a promising therapeutic target for EP-elicited cerebral protection. In conclusion, our findings illustrate that ICS II protects against neuron loss and neuroinflammation after CIRI by inhibiting ROS/NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.","['Epimedium', 'NLRP3', 'cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuron loss']",2023-03-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Adipose-derived endothelial progenitor cell (AdEPCs) transplantation is beneficial for AKI but suffers from low delivery efficiency. This study was conducted to explore the protective effects of magnetically delivered AdEPCs on the repair of renal IRI. Two types of magnetic delivery methods, namely the endocytosis magnetization (EM) method and the immunomagnetic (IM) method were fabricated using PEG@Fe3O4 and CD133@Fe3O4, and their cytotoxicities in AdEPCs were assessed. In the renal IRI rat model, magnetic AdEPCs were injected via the tail vein and a magnet was placed beside the injured kidney for magnetic guidance. The distribution of transplanted AdEPCs, renal function, and tubular damage were evaluated. Our results suggested that CD133@Fe3O4 had the minimum negative effects on the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and migration of AdEPCs compared with PEG@Fe3O4. Renal magnetic guidance could significantly enhance the transplantation efficiency and the therapeutic outcomes of AdEPCs-PEG@Fe3O4 and AdEPCs-CD133@Fe3O4 in the injured kidneys. However, under renal magnetic guidance, AdEPCs-CD133@Fe3O4 had stronger therapeutic effects than PEG@Fe3O4 after renal IRI. The immunomagnetic delivery of AdEPCs with CD133@Fe3O4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for renal IRI.","['CD133', 'EPCs', 'magnetic nanoparticles', 'renal IRI']",2023-02-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Ischemic brain lesion was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion, and the animals with ischemic lesion were compared to the sham controls. Progression of the brain damage and subsequent recovery was longitudinally monitored structurally, by magnetic resonance imaging, and functionally, by neurological deficit assessment. Seven days after the ischemic injury the brains were isolated and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The results showed higher expression in the brain of both, BCL11B and SATB2 in the animals with ischemic lesion compared to the sham controls. The co-expression of both markers, BCL11B and SATB2, increased in the ischemic brains, as well as the co-expression of BCL11B with the beneficial transcriptional factor ATF3 but not its co-expression with detrimental HDAC2. BCL11B was mainly implicated in the ipsilateral and SATB2 in the contralateral brain hemisphere, and their level in these regions correlated with the functional recovery rate. The results indicate that the reactivation of corticogenesis-related transcription factors BCL11B and SATB2 is beneficial after brain ischemic lesion.",[],2023-03-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37236604,Upregulation of P2Y14 receptor in neutrophils promotes inflammation after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"P2Y14 receptor is expressed in neutrophils and is involved in activation of inflammatory signaling. However, the expression and function of P2Y14 receptor in neutrophils after myocardial infarction/reperfusion (MIR) injury remain to be elucidated.In this research, rodent and cellular models of MIR were used to detect the involvement and function of P2Y14 receptor, as well as the regulation of inflammatory signaling via P2Y14 receptor in neutrophils post-MIR.In the early stage post MIR, the expression of P2Y14 receptor was upregulated in CD4+Ly-6G+ neutrophils. Additionally, the expression of P2Y14 receptor was highly induced in neutrophils subjected to uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glu), which is proven to be secreted by cardiomyocytes during ischemia and reperfusion. Our results also showed the beneficial role of P2Y14 receptor antagonist PPTN in counteracting inflammation via promoting polarization of neutrophils to N2 phenotype in the infarct area of the heart tissue after MIR.These findings prove that the P2Y14 receptor is involved in the regulation of inflammation in the infarct area after MIR, and establish a novel signaling pathway concerning the interplay between cardiomyocytes and neutrophils in the heart tissue.","['Inflammation', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'Neutrophil', 'P2Y14 receptor', 'UDP-glucose']",2023-02-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37235522,Mitochondrial respiration analysis in permeabilized porcine left ventricular and human right atrial specimens with ischemia/reperfusion.,"Mitochondrial function is critical to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardioprotection. The measurement of mitochondrial function in isolated mitochondria requires cardiac specimens of about 300 mg and is therefore only possible at the end of an animal experiment or during cardiosurgical interventions in humans. As an alternative, mitochondrial function can be measured in permeabilized myocardial tissue (PMT) specimens of about 2-5 mg, which are retrieved by sequential biopsies in animal experiments and during cardiac catheterization in humans. We attempted to validate measurements of mitochondrial respiration from PMT by comparison to those from isolated mitochondria of left ventricular myocardium from anesthetized pigs undergoing 60 min coronary occlusion and 180 min reperfusion. Mitochondrial respiration was normalized to the content of mitochondrial marker proteins (cytochrome c oxidase 4 (COX4), citrate synthase and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase). When normalized to COX4, mitochondrial respiration measurements in PMT and isolated mitochondria agreed well in Bland-Altman plots (bias score: -0.03 nmol/min/COX4; 95% confidence interval: 6.31 nmol/min/COX4 and -6.37 nmol/min/COX4) and correlated well (slope of 0.77 and Pearson R of 0.87). Mitochondrial dysfunction by ischemia/reperfusion was equally reflected in PMT and isolated mitochondria (44% and 48% reduction of ADP-stimulated complex I respiration). Also in isolated human right atrial trabeculae, simulation of ischemia/reperfusion injury by exposure to 60 min hypoxia and 10 min reoxygenation reduced mitochondrial ADP-stimulated complex I respiration by 37% in PMT. In conclusion, mitochondrial function measurements in permeabilized cardiac tissue can substitute for that in isolated mitochondria to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction following ischemia/reperfusion.","['bioassay', 'mitochondria', 'myocardial ischemia reperfusion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37235521,Placenta-targeted treatment with nMitoQ prevents an endothelin receptor A pathway cardiac phenotype observed in adult male offspring exposed to hypoxia in utero.,"Prenatal hypoxia is associated with an enhanced susceptibility to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in adult offspring, however the mechanisms remain to be fully investigated. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor that acts via endothelin A (ETA) and endothelin B (ETB) receptors and is essential in maintaining cardiovascular (CV) function. Prenatal hypoxia alters the ET-1 system in adult offspring possibly contributing to I/R susceptibility. We previously showed that ex vivo application of ETA antagonist ABT-627 during I/R prevented the recovery of cardiac function in prenatal hypoxia-exposed males but not in normoxic males nor normoxic or prenatal hypoxia-exposed females. In this follow-up study we examined whether placenta-targeted treatment with a nanoparticle encapsulated mitochondrial antioxidant (nMitoQ) during hypoxic pregnancies could alleviate this hypoxic phenotype observed in adult male offspring. We used a rat model of prenatal hypoxia where pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hypoxia (11% O2) from gestational days (GD) 15-21 after injection with 100μL saline or nMitoQ (125 μM) on GD 15. Male offspring were aged to 4 months and ex vivo cardiac recovery from I/R was assessed. Offspring born from hypoxic pregnancies treated with nMitoQ had increased cardiac recovery from I/R in the presence of ABT-627 compared to their untreated counterparts where ABT-627 prevented recovery.

37235497,Neuroprotective Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rats.,"The number of patients having ischemic stroke is increasing year on year. The anesthetic adjuvant dexmedetomidine is neuroprotective in rats and has potential for use in the treatment of ischemic stroke.The neuroprotective mechanism of dexmedetomidine in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was studied in relation to its regulation of the oxidative stress response, astrocyte response, microglia overactivation, and apoptosis-related protein expression.We randomly and equally divided 25 male Sprague-Dawley rats into 5 groups: a sham-operation group, an ischemia-reperfusion injury group, and low-, medium-, and high-dose dexmedetomidine groups. A rat model of focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by embolization of the right middle cerebral artery for 60 minutes and reperfusion for 2 hours. The volume of cerebral infarction was calculated by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. The protein expression levels of caspase-3, methionyl aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2 or MAP2), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF-1) in the cerebral cortex were determined by Western blot and immunohistochemistry.The volume of cerebral infarction in rats decreased with increasing dose of dexmedetomidine (P = .039, 95% CI = .027 to .044). The expression levels of caspase-3, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and allograft inflammatory factor 1 and the amount of 4-hydroxynonenal decreased with increasing doses of dexmedetomidine (P = .033, 95% CI = .021 to .037). Methionyl aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2 or MAP2) expression increased with increasing doses of dexmedetomidine (P = .023, 95% CI = .011 to .028).Dexmedetomidine has a dose-dependent protective effect on cerebral ischemic injury in rats. The neuroprotective effects of dexmedetomidine are achieved, in part, by reducing the oxidative stress response, inhibiting glial overactivation, and inhibiting expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37234367,Transcriptome analysis reveals ADAMTS15 is a potential inflammation-related gene in remote ischemic postconditioning.,"Remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC) induced by brief episodes of the limb ischemia is a potential therapeutic strategy for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, achieved by reducing cardiomyocyte death, inflammation and so on. The actual mechanisms underlying cardioprotection conferred by RIPostC remain unclear. Exploring gene expression profiles in myocardium at transcriptional level is helpful to deepen the understanding on the cardioprotective mechanisms of RIPostC. This study aims to investigate the effect of RIPostC on gene expressions in rat myocardium using transcriptome sequencing.Rat myocardium samples from the RIPostC group, the control group (myocardial ischemia/reperfusion group) and the sham group were performed transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing. The levels of cardiac IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα were analyzed by Elisa. The expression levels of candidate genes were verified by qRT-PCR technique. Infarct size was measured by Evans blue and TTC staining. Apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assays and caspase-3 levels were detected using western blotting.RIPostC can markedly decrease infarct size and reduce the levels of cardiac IL-1β, IL-6 and increase the level of cardiac IL-10. This transcriptome analysis showed that 2 genes were up-regulated (Prodh1 and ADAMTS15) and 5 genes (Caspase-6, Claudin-5, Sccpdh, Robo4 and AABR07011951.1) were down-regulated in the RIPostC group. Go annotation analysis showed that Go terms mainly included cellular process, metabolic process, cell part, organelle, catalytic activity and binding. The KEGG annotation analysis of DEGs found only one pathway, amino acid metabolism, was up-regulated. The relative mRNA expression levels of ADAMTS15, Caspase-6, Claudin-5 and Prodh1 were verified by qRT-PCR, which were consistent with the RNA-seq results. In addition, the relative expression of ADAMTS15 was negatively correlated with the level of cardiac IL-1β (r = -0.748, P = 0.005) and positively correlated with the level of cardiac IL-10 (r = 0.698, P = 0.012). A negative correlation statistical trend was found between the relative expression of ADAMTS15 and the level of cardiac IL-6 (r = -0.545, P = 0.067).ADAMTS15 may be a potential inflammation-related gene in regulation of cardioprotection conferred by remote ischemic postconditioning and a possible therapeutic target for myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in the future.","['ADAMTS15', 'acute myocardial infarction', 'inflammation', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPostC)', 'transcriptome analysis']",2022-11-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37234204,Slowly activating voltage-gated potassium current potentiation by ML277 is a novel cardioprotective intervention.,"Cardiovascular disease is thought to account for nearly a third of deaths worldwide, with ischemic heart disease, including acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction, accounting for 1.7 million deaths per year. There is a clear need for interventions to impart cardioprotection against ischemia. Here, we show that the slowly activating voltage-gated potassium current (IKs) potentiator ML277 imparts cardioprotection against ischemia in cellular and whole-heart models by modulating the action potential duration. In three different metabolic inhibition and reperfusion models, an increased contractile recovery and cell survival was observed with ML277, indicative of protection. Finally, ML277 reduced infarct size in an ex vivo Langendorff coronary ligation model, including if only applied on reperfusion. In conclusion, potentiation of the IKs with ML277 imparted a cardioprotection that was equivalent to the protection reported previously by ischemic preconditioning. These data suggest that IKs potentiation may be therapeutically useful in acute coronary syndromes.","['KCNQ1 (Kv7.1)/KCNE1', 'cardioprotection', 'ischemic protection', 'myocardial infarction', 'slowly activating voltage-gated potassium current (IKs)']",2022-12-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Damage to the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the pathological basis of HT. Here, we investigated the molecular events of BBB damage after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) using in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and in vivo mice middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models. Our results showed that the permeability of bEND.3 monolayer endothelial cells was significantly increased after being exposed to OGD for 2 h. Mice were subjected to 90-min ischemia with 45-min reperfusion, and BBB integrity was significantly damaged, accompanied by tight junction protein occludin degradation, downregulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), phosphorylated Smad (p-Smad), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and the upregulation of PDZ and LIM domain protein 5 (Pdlim5), an adaptor protein that has been shown to regulate TGF-β-Smad3 pathway. In addition, pretreatment with two-week nicotine significantly reduced AIS-induced BBB damage and its associated protein dysregulation via downregulating Pdlim5. Notably, AIS did not significantly induce BBB damage in Pdlim5 deficit mice, but overexpression of Pdlim5 in the striatum with adeno-associated virus produced BBB damage and associated protein dysregulation which could be ameliorated by two-week nicotine pretreatment. More important, AIS induced a significant miR-21 decrease, and miR-21 mimics treatment decreased AIS-induced BBB damage by decreasing Pdlim5. Together, these results demonstrate that nicotine treatment alleviates the AIS-compromised integrity of BBB by regulating Pdlim5.","['Acute ischemic stroke', 'Blood-brain barrier', 'Nicotine', 'Pdlim5', 'TGF-β/Smad3', 'miR-21']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37233787,The RISK pathway leading to mitochondria and cardioprotection: how everything started.,"Ischaemic heart disease, which often manifests clinically as myocardial infarction (MI), remains a major cause of mortality worldwide. Despite the development of effective pre-clinical cardioprotective therapies, clinical translation has been disappointing. Nevertheless, the 'reperfusion injury salvage kinase' (RISK) pathway appears to be a promising target for cardioprotection. This pathway is crucial for the induction of cardioprotection by numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as ischaemic conditioning. An important component of the cardioprotective effects of the RISK pathway involves the prevention of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening and subsequent cardiac cell death. Here, we will review the historical perspective of the RISK pathway and focus on its interaction with mitochondria in the setting of cardioprotection.","['Ischaemia–reperfusion injury', 'Ischaemic preconditioning', 'MPTP', 'Mitochondria', 'PI3Kα', 'RISK pathway']",2023-04-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

HIF stabilizers, originally developed for treating renal anemia, may offer cardiac protection in this context. This narrative review examines the molecular mechanisms governing HIF activation and function, as well as the pathways involved in cell protection. Furthermore, we analyze the distinct cellular roles of HIFs in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. We also explore potential therapies targeting HIFs, emphasizing their possible benefits and limitations.

37232941,Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) in neutrophils enhances myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"The calcium (Ca2+) permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) cation channel is expressed in neutrophils and contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here we tested the hypotheses that TRPV4 promotes neutrophil activation and subsequently aggregates myocardial I/R injury. TRPV4 protein was confirmed in neutrophils and its function was assessed by the current and intracellular Ca2+ concentration elevations evoked by TRPV4 agonists. Furthermore, TRPV4 agonists dose-repandly promoted migration toward fMLP, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) release, which were prevented by pretreatment with a selective TRPV4 antagonist, in neutrophils from TRPV4 knock-out (KO) mice, Ca2+-free medium, or BAPTA-AM + Ca2+-free medium. Blockade of TRPV4 also inhibited the effects of commonly used neutrophil activators N-formyl-l-methionyl-leucyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLP) and Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Mechanically, TRPV4 regulated neutrophil activation, particularly ROS production, by affecting PKCα, P38, and AKT via Ca2+ signaling. In addition, isolated hearts infused with neutrophils from wild-type (WT) mice showed additional myocardial I/R injuries, but not those infused with TRPV4 KO. Our study reveals that TRPV4-mediated neutrophil activation enhances myocardial I/R injury, and it might be a novel therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and other neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases.","['calcium', 'neutrophil activation', 'reactive oxygen species']",2022-10-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37232573,miR-199a-5p from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell exosomes promotes the proliferation of neural stem cells by targeting GSK-3β.,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes are a promising therapeutic agent for human disease, but their effects on neural stem cells (NSCs) subject to spinal cord ischaemia-reperfusion injury (SCIRI) remain unknown. Here, we examine the impact of miR-199a-5p-enriched exosomes derived from BMSCs on NSC proliferation. We establish a rat model of aortic cross-clamping to induce SCIRI in vivo and a primary NSC model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate SCIRI in vitro. CCK8, EdU, and BrdU assays are performed to evaluate the proliferation of NSCs. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is used to determine the number of surviving neurons. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and inclined plane test (IPT) are used to evaluate hind limb motor function. DiO-labelled exosomes are efficiently internalized by NSCs and increase ectopic amounts of miR-199a-5p, which promotes the proliferation of NSCs. In contrast, exosomes derived from miR-199a-5p-depleted BMSCs exert fewer beneficial effects. MiR-199a-5p targets and negatively regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and increases nuclear β-catenin and cyclin D1 levels. miR-199a-5p inhibition reduces the total number of EdU-positive NSCs after OGD/R, but the GSK-3β inhibitor CHIR-99021 reverses this effect. In vivo, intrathecal injection of BMSC-derived exosomes increases the proliferation of endogenous spinal cord NSCs after SCIRI. In addition, more proliferating NSCs are found in rats intrathecally injected with exosomes overexpressing miR-199a-5p. In summary, miR-199a-5p in BMSC-derived exosomes promotes NSC proliferation via GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling.","['GSK-3β', 'bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', 'exosome', 'miR-199a-5p', 'neural stem cells']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37232477,Hippo (YAP)-autophagy axis protects against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury through JNK signaling.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) remains a common complication during liver transplantation (LT) in patients. As a key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been reported to be involved in various physiological and pathological processes. However, it remains elusive whether and how YAP may control autophagy activation during ischemia-reperfusion.Human liver tissues from patients who had undergone LT were obtained to evaluate the correlation between YAP and autophagy activation. Both an in vitro hepatocyte cell line and in vivo liver-specific YAP knockdown mice were used to establish the hepatic ischemia-reperfusion models to determine the role of YAP in the activation of autophagy and the mechanism of regulation.Autophagy was activated in the post-perfusion liver grafts during LT in patients, and the expression of YAP positively correlated with the autophagic level of hepatocytes. Liver-specific knockdown of YAP inhibited hepatocytes autophagy upon hypoxia-reoxygenation and HIRI (P <0.05). YAP deficiency aggravated HIRI by promoting the apoptosis of hepatocytes both in the in vitro and in vivo models (P <0.05). Attenuated HIRI by overexpression of YAP was diminished after the inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine. In addition, inhibiting autophagy activation by YAP knockdown exacerbated mitochondrial damage through increasing reactive oxygen species (P <0.05). Moreover, the regulation of autophagy by YAP during HIRI was mediated by AP1 (c-Jun) N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling through binding to the transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD).YAP protects against HIRI by inducing autophagy via JNK signaling that suppresses the apoptosis of hepatocytes. Targeting Hippo (YAP)-JNK-autophagy axis may provide a novel strategy for the prevention and treatment of HIRI.",[],2022-11-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37232350,Ginsenoside Rg1 regulates autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress via the AMPK/mTOR and PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathways to alleviate alcohol‑induced myocardial injury.,"It has been reported that ginsenoside Rg1 (G‑Rg1) can alleviate alcoholic liver injury, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial ischemia, as well as reperfusion injury. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of G‑Rg1 in alcohol‑induced myocardial injury, as well as to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. For this purpose, H9c2 cells were stimulated with ethanol. Subsequently, H9c2 cell viability and apoptosis were determined using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase and caspase‑3 in the H9c2 cell culture supernatant were detected using corresponding assay kits. In addition, the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)‑light chain 3 (LC3) and that of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were evaluated using GFP‑LC3 assay and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis‑, autophagy‑, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)‑ and adenosine 5'‑monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway‑related proteins were detected using western blot analysis. The results revealed that treatment with G‑Rg1 enhanced the viability and suppressed the apoptosis of ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells. G‑Rg1 also attenuated autophagy and ERS in ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells. In addition, the levels of phosphorylated (p)‑protein kinase R (PKR)‑like ER kinase (PERK), p‑eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CHOP, caspase‑12 and p‑AMPK were downregulated, while the p‑mTOR level was upregulated in ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells treated with G‑Rg1. Furthermore, the co‑treatment of G‑Rg1‑treated ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells with AICAR, an AMPK agonist, or CCT020312, a PERK agonist, inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis, autophagy and ERS. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that G‑Rg1 suppresses autophagy and ERS via inhibiting the AMPK/mTOR and PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathways to alleviate ethanol‑induced H9c2 cell injury.","[""adenosine 5'‑monophosphate‑activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin"", 'autophagy', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'ginsenoside Rg1', 'myocardial injury', 'protein kinase R (PKR)‑like ER kinase']",2023-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37232163,LTBP4 (Latent Transforming Growth Factor Beta Binding Protein 4) Protects Against Renal Fibrosis via Mitochondrial and Vascular Impacts.,"As a part of natural disease progression, acute kidney injury (AKI) can develop into chronic kidney disease via renal fibrosis and inflammation. LTBP4 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4) regulates transforming growth factor beta, which plays a role in renal fibrosis pathogenesis. We previously investigated the role of LTBP4 in chronic kidney disease. Here, we examined the role of LTBP4 in AKI.LTBP4 expression was evaluated in human renal tissues, obtained from healthy individuals and patients with AKI, using immunohistochemistry. LTBP4 was knocked down in both C57BL/6 mice and human renal proximal tubular cell line HK-2. AKI was induced in mice and HK-2 cells using ischemia-reperfusion injury and hypoxia, respectively. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1, an inhibitor of DRP1 (dynamin-related protein 1), was used to reduce mitochondrial fragmentation. Gene and protein expression were then examined to assess inflammation and fibrosis. The results of bioenergetic studies for mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis were assessed.LTBP4 expression was upregulated in the renal tissues of patients with AKI. Ltbp4-knockdown mice showed increased renal tissue injury and mitochondrial fragmentation after ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as increased inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis, and decreased angiogenesis. in vitro studies using HK-2 cells revealed similar results. The energy profiles of Ltbp4-deficient mice and LTBP4-deficient HK-2 cells indicated decreased ATP production. LTBP4-deficient HK-2 cells exhibited decreased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Human aortic endothelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells exhibited decreased angiogenesis when treated with LTBP4-knockdown conditioned media. Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 treatment ameliorated inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in mice and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress in HK-2 cells.Our study is the first to demonstrate that LTBP4 deficiency increases AKI severity, consequently leading to chronic kidney disease. Potential therapies focusing on LTBP4-associated angiogenesis and LTBP4-regulated DRP1-dependent mitochondrial division are relevant to renal injury.","['angiogenesis', 'chronic kidney disease', 'latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4', 'mitochondrial function', 'renal fibrosis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37231766,Intrarenal Anti-Leptin Treatment Attenuates Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury.,"Renal ischemia and reperfusion (IR) injury introduces cellular stress and is the main cause of acute kidney damage. Renal cells exposed to noxious stress induce the expression of the pleiotropic hormone leptin. As we have previously revealed a deleterious stress-related role for leptin expression, these results suggested that leptin is also involved in pathological renal remodeling. The systemic functions of leptin preclude the study of its local effects using conventional approaches. We have therefore designed a method to locally perturb leptin activity in specific tissues without affecting its systemic levels. This study explores whether local anti-leptin strategy is reno-protection in a post-IR porcine kidney model.We induced renal IR injury in pigs by exposing kidneys to ischemia and revascularization. Upon reperfusion, kidneys instantly received an intraarterial bolus of either a leptin antagonist (LepA) or saline solution. Peripheral blood was sampled to assess systemic leptin, IL-6, creatinine, and BUN levels, and post-operative tissue samples were analyzed by H&E histochemistry and immunohistochemistry.Histology of IR/saline kidneys exhibited extensive necrosis of proximal tubular epithelial cells, as well as elevated levels of apoptosis markers and inflammation. In contrast, IR/LepA kidneys showed no signs of necrosis or inflammation, with normal IL-6 and TLR4 levels. LepA treatment led to upregulation in mRNA levels of leptin, leptin receptor, ERK1/2, STAT3, and transport molecule NHE3.Local, intrarenal post-ischemic LepA treatment at reperfusion prevented apoptosis and inflammation and was reno-protective. Selective intrarenal administration of LepA at reperfusion may provide a viable option for clinical implementation.",[],2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37231688,Improving neurological outcome for acute basilar artery occlusion with sufficient recanalization after thrombectomy by intraarterial tenecteplase (INSIST-IT): Rationale and design.,"The potential benefit of intraarterial tenecteplase in acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) patients with successful reperfusion following endovascular treatment (EVT) has not been studied.To explore the efficacy and safety of intraarterial tenecteplase in acute BAO patients with successful reperfusion after EVT.A maximum of 228 patients are required to test the superiority hypothesis with 80% power according to a two-side 0.05 level of significance, stratified by center.We will conduct a prospective, randomized, adaptive-enrichment, open-label, blinded-end point, multicenter trial. Eligible BAO patients with successful recanalization after EVT [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 2b-3] will be randomly assigned into the experimental and control group with a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the experimental group will receive intraarterial tenecteplase (0.2-0.3 mg/min for 20-30 min), while patients in the control group will receive routine treatment according to the usual practice of each center. Patients in both groups will receive standard guideline-based medical treatment.The primary efficacy endpoint is a favorable functional outcome, defined as the modified Rankin Scale 0-3 at 90 days after randomization. The primary safety endpoint is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, defined as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score increase ⩾4 caused by intracranial hemorrhage within 48 h after randomization. Subgroup analysis of the primary outcome will be performed by age, gender, baseline NIHSS score, baseline pc-ASPECTS, intravenous thrombolysis, time from estimated symptom onset to treatment, mTICI, blood glucose, and stroke etiology.The results of this study will provide evidence of whether adjunct use of intraarterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion with EVT is associated with better outcomes for acute BAO patients.","['Basilar artery occlusion', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'endovascular treatment', 'intraarterial', 'protocol', 'randomized trial', 'tenecteplase']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37231686,Prediction of delayed reperfusion in patients with incomplete reperfusion following thrombectomy.,"The clinical course of patients with incomplete reperfusion after thrombectomy, defined as an expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) score of 2a-2c, is heterogeneous. Patients showing delayed reperfusion (DR) have good clinical outcomes, almost comparable to patients with ad-hoc TICI3 reperfusion. We aimed to develop and internally validate a model that predicts DR occurrence in order to inform physicians about the likelihood of a benign natural disease progression.Single-center registry analysis including all consecutive, study-eligible patients admitted between 02/2015 and 12/2021. Preliminary variable selection for the prediction of DR was performed using bootstrapped stepwise backward logistic regression. Interval validation was performed with bootstrapping and the final model was developed using a random forests classification algorithm. Model performance metrics are reported with discrimination, calibration, and clinical decision curves. Primary outcome was concordance statistics as a measure of goodness of fit for the occurrence of DR.A total of 477 patients (48.8% female, mean age 74 years) were included, of whom 279 (58.5%) showed DR on 24 follow-up. The model's discriminative ability for predicting DR was adequate (C-statistics 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72-0.85]). Variables with strongest association with DR were: atrial fibrillation (aOR 2.06 [95% CI: 1.23-3.49]), Intervention-To-Follow-Up time (aOR 1.06 [95% CI: 1.03-1.10]), eTICI score (aOR 3.49 [95% CI: 2.64-4.73]), and collateral status (aOR 1.33 [95% CI: 1.06-1.68]). At a risk threshold of R = 30%, use of the prediction model could potentially reduce the number of additional attempts in one out of four patients who will have spontaneous DR, without missing any patients who do not show spontaneous DR on follow-up.The model presented here shows fair predictive accuracy for estimating chances of DR after incomplete thrombectomy. This may inform treating physicians on the chances of a favorable natural disease progression if no further reperfusion attempts are made.","['Perfusion Imaging', 'decision curves', 'delayed reperfusion', 'incomplete reperfusion', 'prediction model']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

We propose that improved preclinical pipelines and increased investment in drug target identification for AMI is critical to stem the increasing global health burden of heart failure.","['ASIC1a', 'Acid sensing ion channel 1a', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Drug development', 'Ischaemia–reperfusion injury']",2022-09-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37230395,Transcriptome analysis of novel macrophage M1-related biomarkers and potential therapeutic agents in ischemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplantation based on the WGCNA and CIBERSORT algorithms.,"Lung transplantation is the last effective treatment for end-stage respiratory failure, however, with ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) inevitably occurring in postoperative period. IRI is the major pathophysiologic mechanism of primary graft dysfunction, a severe complication that contributes to prolonged length of stay and overall mortality. The understanding of pathophysiology and etiology remain limited and the underlying molecular mechanism, as well as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, urgently require exploration. Excessive uncontrolled inflammatory response is the core mechanism of IRI. In this research, a weighted gene co-expression network was established using the CIBERSORT and WGCNA algorithms in order to identify macrophage-related hub genes based on the data downloaded from the GEO database (GSE127003, GSE18995). 692 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in reperfused lung allografts were identified, with three genes recognized as being related to M1 macrophages and validated as differentially expressed using GSE18995 dataset. Of these putative novel biomarker genes, TCRα subunit constant gene (TRAC) were downregulated, while Perforin-1 (PRF1) and Granzyme B (GZMB) were upregulated in reperfused vs. ischemic lung allografts. Furthermore, we obtained 189 potentially therapeutic small molecules for IRI after lung transplantation from the CMap database among which PD-98059 was the top molecule with the highest absolute correlated connectivity score (CS). Our study provides the novel insights into the impact of immune cells on the etiology of IRI and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

37230379,Distinct effects of cardiac mitochondrial calcium uniporter inactivation via EMRE deletion in the short and long term.,"Transport of Ca2+ into mitochondria is thought to stimulate the production of ATP, a critical process in the heart's fight or flight response, but excess Ca2+ can trigger cell death. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex is the primary route of Ca2+ transport into mitochondria, in which the channel-forming protein MCU and the regulatory protein EMRE are essential for activity. In previous studies, chronic Mcu or Emre deletion differ from acute cardiac Mcu deletion in response to adrenergic stimulation and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, despite equivalent inactivation of rapid mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. To explore this discrepancy between chronic and acute loss of uniporter activity, we compared short-term and long-term Emre deletion using a novel conditional cardiac-specific, tamoxifen-inducible mouse model. After short-term Emre deletion (3 weeks post-tamoxifen) in adult mice, cardiac mitochondria were unable to take up Ca2+, had lower basal mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, and displayed attenuated Ca2+-induced ATP production and mPTP opening. Moreover, short-term EMRE loss blunted cardiac response to adrenergic stimulation and improved maintenance of cardiac function in an ex vivo I/R model. We then tested whether the long-term absence of EMRE (3 months post-tamoxifen) in adulthood would lead to distinct outcomes. After long-term Emre deletion, mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and function, as well as cardiac response to adrenergic stimulation, were similarly impaired as in short-term deletion.

37230215,Regulation of pericyte metabolic reprogramming restricts the AKI to CKD transition.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality and is recognized as a long-term risk factor for progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). The AKI to CKD transition is characterized by interstitial fibrosis and the proliferation of collagen-secreting myofibroblasts. Pericytes are the major source of myofibroblasts in kidney fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanism of pericyte-myofibroblast transition (PMT) is still unclear. Here we investigated the role of metabolic reprogramming in PMT.Unilateral ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI to CKD mouse model and TGF-β-treated pericyte-like cells were used to detect the levels of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glycolysis, and the critical signaling pathways during PMT under the treatment of drugs regulating metabolic reprogramming.PMT is characterized by a decrease in FAO and an increase in glycolysis. Enhancement of FAO by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC1α) activator ZLN-005 or suppression of glycolysis by the hexokinase 2 (HK2) inhibitor 2-DG can inhibit PMT, preventing the transition of AKI to CKD. Mechanistically, AMPK modulates various pathways involved in the metabolic switch from glycolysis to FAO. Specifically, the PGC1α-CPT1A pathway activates FAO, while inhibition of the HIF1α-HK2 pathway drives glycolysis inhibition. The modulations of these pathways by AMPK contribute to inhibiting PMT.Metabolic reprogramming controls the fate of pericyte transdifferentiation and targets the abnormal metabolism of pericytes can effectively prevent AKI to CKD transition.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Fatty acid oxidation', 'Fibrosis', 'Glycolysis', 'Pericyte-myofibroblast transition']",2023-03-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37230196,Downregulation of Nogo-B ameliorates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice through regulating microglia polarization via TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway.,"Many studies have shown a close association between Nogo-B and inflammation-related diseases. However, uncertainty does exist, regarding Nogo-B function in the pathological progression of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was utilized in C57BL/6L mice to mimic ischemic stroke in vivo. Using oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (ODG/R) model in microglia cells (BV-2) to establish cerebral I/R injury in vitro. Various methods, including Nogo-B siRNA transfection, mNSS and the rotarod test, TTC, HE and Nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, ELISA, TUNEL and qRT-PCR were employed to probe into the effect of Nogo-B downregulation on cerebral I/R injury and the potential mechanisms. A small amount of Nogo-B expression (protein and mRNA) was observed in cortex and hippocampus before ischemia, then Nogo-B expression increased significantly on day 1, reaching the maximum on day 3, remaining stable on day 14 after I/R, and decreasing gradually after 21 days, but it still rose significantly compared with that observed preischemia. Nogo-B down-regulation could markedly reduce the neurological score and infarct volume, improve the histopathological changes and neuronal apoptosis, lower the number of CD86+/Iba1+ cells and the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and raise the density of NeuN fluorescence, the number of CD206+/Iba1+ cells, and the level of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β in brain of MCAO/R mice. Treatment with Nogo-B siRNA or TAK-242 in BV-2 cells could obviously decrease the CD86 fluorescence density and the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, increase CD206 fluorescence density and the mRNA expression of IL-10 after OGD/R injury. In addition, the expression of TLR4, p-IκBα and p-p65 proteins significantly increased in the brain after MCAO/R and BV-2 cells exposed to OGD/R. Treatment with Nogo-B siRNA or TAK-242 prominently reduced the expression of TLR4, p-IκBα and p-p65. Our findings suggest that the down-regulation of Nogo-B exerts protective effect on cerebral I/R injury by modulating the microglia polarization through inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Nogo-B may be a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","['Ischemic stroke', 'Microglia', 'Nogo-B', 'Polarization', 'TLR4/NF-κB']",2023-02-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37229319,Roflumilast reduces myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in vivo and in vitro by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.,"Myocardial tissue cell damage induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) notably elevates the mortality rate, increases the complications of patients with myocardial infarction and decreases reperfusion benefit in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. Roflumilast protect against cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of roflumilast on MI/R injury and the underlying mechanisms. To simulate MI/R in vivo and in vitro, the rat model of MI/R was established and H9C2 cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induction, respectively. The myocardial infarction areas were observed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The myocardial enzyme levels in serum and levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in cardiac tissue were assessed by corresponding assay kits. The cardiac damage was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiac tissue and H9C2 cells was detected using the JC-1 staining kit. The viability and apoptosis of H9C2 cells were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 and TUNEL assay, respectively. The levels of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers and ATP in H/R-induced H9C2 cells were analyzed by corresponding assay kits. Western blotting was used for the estimation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway-, apoptosis- and mitochondrial regulation-associated protein levels. The mPTP opening was detected using a calcein-loading/cobalt chloride-quenching system. The results indicated that roflumilast decreased MI/R-induced myocardial infarction by alleviating myocardial injury and mitochondrial damage through the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. In addition, roflumilast mitigated viability damage, alleviated oxidative stress, attenuated the inflammatory response and decreased mitochondrial damage in H/R-induced H9C2 cells by activating the AMPK signaling pathway. However, compound C, an inhibitor of the AMPK signaling pathway, reversed the effect of roflumilast on H/R-induced H9C2 cells. In conclusion, roflumilast alleviated myocardial infarction in MI/R rats and attenuated H/R-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response and mitochondrial damage in H9C2 cells by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.","['AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway', 'mitochondrial damage', 'myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury', 'roflumilast']",2022-09-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37229263,Single-nucleus ribonucleic acid-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics reveal the cardioprotection of Shexiang Baoxin Pill (SBP) in mice with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Aim: The Shexiang Baoxin Pill (SBP) has been extensively used to treat cardiovascular diseases in China for four decades, and its clinical efficacy has been widely approved. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved remains largely unexplored. Research attempting to understand the underlying mechanism is ongoing, but the findings are controversial. Here, we aimed to explore the possible mechanism of SBP in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury using heart single-nucleus and spatial ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. Methods: We established a murine myocardial I/R injury model in C57BL/6 mice by ligating and recanalizing the left coronary artery anterior descending branch. Subsequently, single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics were performed on mice cardiac tissue. We initially assessed the status of cell types and subsets in the model administered with or without SBP. Results: We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively analyze cell types in the cardiac tissue of sham, I/R, and SBP mice. Nine samples from nine individuals were analyzed, and 75,546 cells were obtained. We classified the cells into 28 clusters based on their expression characteristics and annotated them into seven cell types: cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, smooth muscle cells, B cells, and T cells. The SBP group had distinct cellular compositions and features than the I/R group. Furthermore, SBP-induced cardioprotection against I/R was associated with enhanced cardiac contractility, reduced endocardial cell injury, increased endocardial-mediated angiogenesis, and inhibited fibroblast proliferation. In addition, macrophages had active properties. Conclusion: SBP improves the early LVEF of I/R mice and has a cardioprotective effect. Through sequencing analysis, we observed that SBP can increase the gene expression of Nppb and Npr3 in the infarct area of the heart. Npr3 is related to vascular generation mediated by endocardial cells and requires further research. In addition, SBP increases the number of fibroblasts, inhibits the expression of genes related to fibroblast activation and proliferation, and increases the transformation of endothelial cells into fibroblasts. These findings will help to indicate directions for further research.","['Shexiang Baoxin Pill', 'myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury', 'single-nucleus RNA sequencing', 'spatial transcriptomics', 'traditional Chinese medicine']",2023-02-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37229259,Modulation of gut microbiota alleviates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats by inhibiting M1 polarization of microglia.,"Gut microbiota affects the gut-brain axis; hence, the modulation of the microbiota has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, the role and mechanism of the gut microbiota in regulating microglial polarization during CIRI remain poorly understood. Herein, using a middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model, we evaluated changes in the gut microbiota after CIRI and the potential effects of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) on the brain. Rats underwent either MCAO/R or sham surgery, and then they received FMT (started 3 days later; continued for 10 days). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, neurological outcome scale, and Fluoro-Jade C staining showed that MCAO/R induced cerebral infarction, neurological deficits, and neuronal degeneration. In addition, immunohistochemistry or real-time PCR assay showed increased expression levels of M1-macrophage markers-TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS-in the rats following MCAO/R. Our finding suggests that microglial M1 polarization is involved in CIRI. 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data revealed an imbalance in the gut microbiota of MCAO/R animals. In contrast, FMT reversed this MCAO/R-induced imbalance in the gut microbiota and ameliorated nerve injury. In addition, FMT prevented the upregulation in the ERK and NF-κB pathways, which reversed the M2-to-M1 microglial shift 10 days after MCAO/R injury in rats. Our primary data showed that the modulation of the gut microbiota can attenuate CIRI in rats by inhibiting microglial M1 polarization through the ERK and NF-κB pathways. However, an understanding of the underlying mechanism requires further study.","['NF-κB–nuclear factor kappa B', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'fecal microbiota transplant', 'gut microbiota', 'microglial polarization']",2022-12-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37229230,Signs and signals limiting myocardial damage using PICSO: a scoping review decoding paradigm shifts toward a new encounter.,"Inducing recovery in myocardial ischemia is limited to a timely reopening of infarct vessels and clearing the cardiac microcirculation, but additional molecular factors may impact recovery.In this scoping review, we identify the paradigm shifts decoding the branching points of experimental and clinical evidence of pressure-controlled intermittent coronary sinus occlusion (PICSO), focusing on myocardial salvage and molecular implications on infarct healing and repair.The reporting of evidence was structured chronologically, describing the evolution of the concept from mainstream research to core findings dictating a paradigm change. All data reported in this scoping review are based on published data, but new evaluations are also included.Previous findings relate hemodynamic PICSO effects clearing reperfused microcirculation to myocardial salvage. The activation of venous endothelium opened a new avenue for understanding PICSO. A flow-sensitive signaling molecule, miR-145-5p, showed a five-fold increase in porcine myocardium subjected to PICSO.Verifying our theory of ""embryonic recall,"" an upregulation of miR-19b and miR-101 significantly correlates to the time of pressure increase in cardiac veins during PICSO (r2 = 0.90, p < 0.05; r2 = 0.98, p < 0.03), suggesting a flow- and pressure-dependent secretion of signaling molecules into the coronary circulation. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte proliferation by miR-19b and the protective role of miR-101 against remodeling show another potential interaction of PICSO in myocardial healing.Molecular signaling during PICSO may contribute to retroperfusion toward deprived myocardium and clearing the reperfused cardiac microcirculation. A burst of specific miRNA reiterating embryonic molecular pathways may play a role in targeting myocardial jeopardy and will be an essential therapeutic contribution in limiting infarcts in recovering patients.","['PICSO', 'acute coronary syndromes', 'acute heart failure', 'hypothesis', 'molecular signaling', 'myocardial development and regeneration', 'non-coding RNA']",2022-08-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, cardiac and cerebral atherothrombotic complications still account for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Novel therapeutic strategies are critical to improve patient outcomes following cardiovascular diseases. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, that regulate gene expression. Here, we discuss the role of miR-182 in regulating myocardial proliferation, migration, hypoxia, ischemia, apoptosis and hypertrophy in atherosclerosis, CAD, MI, I/R injury, organ transplant, cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension, heart failure, congenital heart disease and cardiotoxicity.

37228603,Single-cell landscape dissecting the transcription and heterogeneity of innate lymphoid cells in ischemic heart.,"Until now, few articles have revealed the potential roles of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in cardiovascular diseases. However, the infiltration of ILC subsets in ischemic myocardium, the roles of ILC subsets in myocardial infarction (MI) and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) and the related cellular and molecular mechanisms have not been described with a sufficient level of detail.In the current study, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: MI, MIRI and sham group. Single-cell sequencing technology was used to perform dimensionality reduction clustering of ILC to analyze the ILC subset landscape at a single-cell resolution, and finally flow cytometry was used to confirm the existence of the new ILC subsets in different disease groups.Five ILC subsets were found, including ILC1, ILC2a, ILC2b, ILCdc and ILCt. It is worth noting that ILCdc, ILC2b and ILCt were identified as new ILC subclusters in the heart. The cellular landscapes of ILCs were revealed and signal pathways were predicted. Furthermore, pseudotime trajectory analysis exhibited different ILC statuses and traced related gene expression in normal and ischemic conditions. In addition, we established a ligand-receptor-transcription factor-target gene regulatory network to disclose cell communications among ILC clusters. Moreover, we further revealed the transcriptional features of the ILCdc and ILC2a subsets. Finally, the existence of ILCdc was confirmed by flow cytometry.Collectively, by characterizing the spectrums of ILC subclusters, our results provide a new blueprint for understanding ILC subclusters' roles in myocardial ischemia diseases and further potential treatment targets.","['innate lymphoid cells', 'myocardial infarction', 'myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI)', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'transcription']",2022-12-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37228593,Early activation and recruitment of invariant natural killer T cells during liver ischemia-reperfusion: the major role of the alarmin interleukin-33.,"Over the past thirty years, the complexity of the αβ-T cell compartment has been enriched by the identification of innate-like T cells (ITCs), which are composed mainly of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Based on animal studies using ischemia-reperfusion (IR) models, a key role has been attributed to iNKT cells in close connection with the alarmin/cytokine interleukin (IL)-33, as early sensors of cell-stress in the initiation of acute sterile inflammation. Here we have investigated whether the new concept of a biological axis of circulating iNKT cells and IL-33 applies to humans, and may be extended to other ITC subsets, namely MAIT and γδ-T cells, in the acute sterile inflammation sequence occurring during liver transplant (LT). From a prospective biological collection of recipients, we reported that LT was accompanied by an early and preferential activation of iNKT cells, as attested by almost 40% of cells having acquired the expression of CD69 at the end of LT (i.e. 1-3 hours after portal reperfusion), as opposed to only 3-4% of conventional T cells. Early activation of iNKT cells was positively correlated with the systemic release of the alarmin IL-33 at graft reperfusion. Moreover, in a mouse model of hepatic IR, iNKT cells were activated in the periphery (spleen), and recruited in the liver in WT mice, as early as the first hour after reperfusion, whereas this phenomenon was virtually missing in IL-33-deficient mice. Although to a lesser degree than iNKT cells, MAIT and γδ-T cells also seemed targeted during LT, as attested by 30% and 10% of them acquiring CD69 expression, respectively. Like iNKT cells, and in clear contrast to γδ-T cells, activation of MAIT cells during LT was closely associated with both release of IL-33 immediately after graft reperfusion and severity of liver dysfunction occurring during the first three post-operative days. All in all, this study identifies iNKT and MAIT cells in connection with IL-33 as new key cellular factors and mechanisms of acute sterile inflammation in humans. Further investigations are required to confirm the implication of MAIT and iNKT cell subsets, and to precisely assess their functions, in the clinical course of sterile inflammation accompanying LT.","['alarmin', 'iNKT cell', 'innate like T cell', 'interleukin-33', 'ischemia - reperfusion', 'liver transplantation', 'sterile Inflammation']",2022-11-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37226390,Loss of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan sulfation allows delayed sympathetic reinnervation after cardiac ischemia-reperfusion.,"Sympathetic nerve loss in the heart predicts the risk of ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients. Sympathetic denervation after cardiac ischemia-reperfusion is sustained by matrix components chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar. We showed that 4,6-sulfation of CSPGs was critical for preventing nerve growth into the scar. Promoting early reinnervation with therapeutics reduces arrhythmias during the first 2 weeks after MI, but the longer-term consequences of restoring innervation are unknown. Therefore, we asked if the beneficial effects of early reinnervation were sustained. We compared cardiac function and arrhythmia susceptibility 40 days after MI in mice treated on Days 3-10 with vehicle or with intracellular sigma peptide to restore innervation. Surprisingly, both groups had normal innervation density in the cardiac scar 40 days after MI, indicating delayed reinnervation of the infarct in vehicle-treated mice. That coincided with similar cardiac function and arrhythmia susceptibility in the two groups. We investigated the mechanism allowing delayed reinnervation of the cardiac scar. We found that CSPG 4,6-sulfation, which is elevated early after ischemia-reperfusion, was reduced to control levels allowing reinnervation of the infarct. Thus, remodeling of extracellular matrix weeks after injury leads to remodeling of sympathetic neurons in the heart.",[],2023-03-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37225977,A small-molecule PI3Kα activator for cardioprotection and neuroregeneration.,"Harnessing the potential beneficial effects of kinase signalling through the generation of direct kinase activators remains an underexplored area of drug development1-5. This also applies to the PI3K signalling pathway, which has been extensively targeted by inhibitors for conditions with PI3K overactivation, such as cancer and immune dysregulation. Here we report the discovery of UCL-TRO-1938 (referred to as 1938 hereon), a small-molecule activator of the PI3Kα isoform, a crucial effector of growth factor signalling. 1938 allosterically activates PI3Kα through a distinct mechanism by enhancing multiple steps of the PI3Kα catalytic cycle and causes both local and global conformational changes in the PI3Kα structure. This compound is selective for PI3Kα over other PI3K isoforms and multiple protein and lipid kinases. It transiently activates PI3K signalling in all rodent and human cells tested, resulting in cellular responses such as proliferation and neurite outgrowth. In rodent models, acute treatment with 1938 provides cardioprotection from ischaemia-reperfusion injury and, after local administration, enhances nerve regeneration following nerve crush. This study identifies a chemical tool to directly probe the PI3Kα signalling pathway and a new approach to modulate PI3K activity, widening the therapeutic potential of targeting these enzymes through short-term activation for tissue protection and regeneration. Our findings illustrate the potential of activating kinases for therapeutic benefit, a currently largely untapped area of drug development.",[],2021-09-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37225778,Genetic and histopathological analysis of spermatogenesis after short-term testicular torsion in rats.,"Patients with testicular torsion (TT) may exhibit impaired spermatogenesis from reperfusion injury after detorsion surgery. Alteration in the expressions of spermatogenesis-related genes induced by TT have not been fully elucidated.Eight-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped as follows: group 1 (sham-operated), group 2 (TT without reperfusion) and group 3 (TT with reperfusion). TT was induced by rotating the left testis 720° for 1 h. Testicular reperfusion proceeded for 24 h. Histopathological examination, oxidative stress biomarker measurements, RNA sequencing and RT-PCR were performed.Testicular ischemia/reperfusion injury induced marked histopathological changes. Germ cell apoptosis was significantly increased in group 3 compared with group 1 and 2 (mean apoptotic index: 26.22 vs. 0.64 and 0.56; p = 0.024, and p = 0.024, respectively). Johnsen score in group 3 was smaller than that in group 1 and 2 (mean: 8.81 vs 9.45 and 9.47 points/tubule; p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Testicular ischemia/reperfusion injury significantly upregulated the expression of genes associated with apoptosis and antioxidant enzymes and significantly downregulated the expression of genes associated with spermatogenesis.One hour of TT followed by reperfusion injury caused histopathological testicular damage. The relatively high Johnsen score indicated spermatogenesis was maintained. Genes associated with spermatogenesis were downregulated in the TT rat model.How ischemia/reperfusion injury in testicular torsion (TT) affects the expressions of genes associated with spermatogenesis has not been fully elucidated. This is the first study to report comprehensive gene expression profiles using next generation sequencing for an animal model of TT. Our results revealed that ischemia/reperfusion injury downregulated the expression of genes associated with spermatogenesis and sperm function in addition to histopathological damage, even though the duration of ischemia was short.",[],2022-12-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37225700,Activation of HIF-1α C-terminal transactivation domain protects against hypoxia-induced kidney injury through hexokinase 2-mediated mitophagy.,"The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), as a master regulator of adaptive responses to hypoxia, possesses two transcriptional activation domains [TAD, N-terminal (NTAD), and C-terminal (CTAD)]. Although the roles of HIF-1α NTAD in kidney diseases have been recognized, the exact effects of HIF-1α CTAD in kidney diseases are poorly understood. Here, two independent mouse models of hypoxia-induced kidney injury were established using HIF-1α CTAD knockout (HIF-1α CTAD-/-) mice. Furthermore, hexokinase 2 (HK2) and mitophagy pathway are modulated using genetic and pharmacological methods, respectively. We demonstrated that HIF-1α CTAD-/- aggravated kidney injury in two independent mouse models of hypoxia-induced kidney injury, including ischemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury and unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced nephropathy. Mechanistically, we found that HIF-1α CTAD could transcriptionally regulate HK2 and subsequently ameliorate hypoxia-induced tubule injury. Furthermore, it was found that HK2 deficiency contributed to severe renal injury through mitophagy inhibition, while mitophagy activation using urolithin A could significantly protect against hypoxia-induced kidney injury in HIF-1α C-TAD-/- mice. Our findings suggested that the HIF-1α CTAD-HK2 pathway represents a novel mechanism of kidney response to hypoxia, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for hypoxia-induced kidney injury.",[],2022-12-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37225176,Roxadustat promotes hypoxia-inducible factor-1α/vascular endothelial growth factor signalling to enhance random skin flap survival in rats.,"Random skin flaps have limited clinical application as a broad surgical reconstruction treatment because of distal necrosis. The prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein inhibitor roxadustat (RXD) enhances angiogenesis and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation. This study explored the function of RXD in the survival of random skin flaps. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into low-dose RXD group (L-RXD group, 10 mg/kg/2 day), high-dose RXD group (H-RXD group, 25 mg/kg/2 day), and control group (1 mL of solvent, 1:9 DMSO:corn oil). The proportion of surviving flaps was determined on day 7 after surgery. Angiogenesis was assessed by lead oxide/gelatin angiography, and microcirculation blood perfusion was evaluated by laser Doppler flow imaging. Specimens in zone II were obtained, and the contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured as indicators of oxidative stress. Histopathological status was evaluated with haematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected by immunohistochemistry. RXD promoted flap survival and microcirculatory blood perfusion. Angiogenesis was detected distinctly in the experimental group. SOD activity increased and the MDA level decreased in the experimental group. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the expression levels of HIF-1α and VEGF were increased while the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were decreased after RXD injection. RXD promoted random flap survival by reinforcing vascular hyperplasia and decreasing inflammation and ischaemia-reperfusion injury.","['HIF-1α', 'VEGF', 'angiogenesis', 'inflammation', 'necrosis', 'random skin flap', 'roxadustat']",2023-03-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37224696,Oxidization of optic atrophy 1 cysteines occurs during heart ischemia-reperfusion and amplifies cell death by oxidative stress.,"During cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, excess reactive oxygen species can damage mitochondrial, cellular and organ function. Here we show that cysteine oxidation of the mitochondrial protein Opa1 contributes to mitochondrial damage and cell death caused by oxidative stress. Oxy-proteomics of ischemic-reperfused hearts reveal oxidation of the C-terminal C786 of Opa1 and treatment of perfused mouse hearts, adult cardiomyocytes, and fibroblasts with H2O2 leads to the formation of a reduction-sensitive ∼180 KDa Opa1 complex, distinct from the ∼270 KDa one antagonizing cristae remodeling. This Opa1 oxidation process is curtailed by mutation of C786 and of the other 3 Cys residues of its C-terminal domain (Opa1TetraCys). When reintroduced in Opa1-/- cells, Opa1TetraCys is not efficiently processed into short Opa1TetraCys and hence fails to fuse mitochondria. Unexpectedly, Opa1TetraCys restores mitochondrial ultrastructure in Opa1-/- cells and protects them from H2O2-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cristae remodeling, cytochrome c release and cell death. Thus, preventing the Opa1 oxidation occurring during cardiac ischemia-reperfusion reduces mitochondrial damage and cell death induced by oxidative stress independent of mitochondrial fusion.",[],2023-03-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37223200,Cardio-Protective Role of a Gut Hormone Obestatin: A Narrative Review.,"Obestatin is a gut hormone composed of 23 amino acids that play a role in protecting the heart. It is synthesized from the same preproghrelin gut hormone gene as another gut hormone. The function and receptor of obestatin remain controversial, despite being present in various organs such as the liver, heart, mammary gland, pancreas, and more. The activity of obestatin is opposite to that of ghrelin, another hormone. The GPR-39 receptor is used by obestatin to exert its effects. Obestatin's cardioprotective role can be attributed to its ability to affect various factors, including adipose tissue, blood pressure regulation, heart, ischemia-reperfusion injury, endothelial cells, and diabetes. Because these factors are related to the cardiovascular system, modifying them via obestatin can provide cardioprotection. Furthermore, ghrelin, its antagonist hormone, regulates cardiovascular health. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemia-reperfusion injury can all alter ghrelin/obestatin levels. Obestatin has also been shown to impact other organs, reducing weight and appetite, inhibiting food intake, and increasing adipogenesis. Obestatin has a brief half-life and is quickly degraded by proteases in the blood, liver, and kidneys after entering circulation. This article offers insights into the cardiac function of obestatin.","['blood pressure', 'cardio-protection', 'ghrelin obestatin ratio', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'obestatin']",2022-08-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

After pretreatment with GA (100 mg/kg), or vehicle (Veh) (normal saline, 2 ml/kg) for ten days, and 60 minutes' exposure to dust storm including PM (PM, 2000-8000 g/m3) every day, 4-vessel occlusion (4VO) type of I/R was induced. Three days after I/R induction, we evaluated behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, molecular and brain tissue inflammatory cytokine changes. Our findings indicated that pretreatment with GA significantly reduced cognitive impairments caused by I/R (P < 0.05) and hippocampal LTP impairments caused by I/R after PM exposure (P < 0.001). Additionally, after exposure to PM, I/R significantly elevated the tumor necrosis factor α content (P < 0.01) and miR-124 level (P < 0.001) while pre-treatment with GA reduced the level of miR-124 (P < 0.001). Histopathological results also revealed that I/R and PM caused cell death in the hippocampus CA1 area (P < 0.001) and that GA decreased the rate of cell death (P < 0.001). Our findings show that GA can prevent brain inflammation, and thus cognitive and LTP deficits caused by I/R, PM exposure, or both.","['Ambient air particulate matter', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'Gallic acid', 'Hippocampal long term potentiation', 'Inflammatory cytokines', 'Rat']",2023-02-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Characterization of cells was evaluated with CD44, CD90, CD34 and CD45 antibodies. Exosomes from AD-MSCs were obtained with the miRCURY exosome isolation kit. 21 rats were divided into 3 groups. The I/R model was created as 720° torsion for 4 h and reperfusion for 4 h. In the Sham group (SG), only scrotal incision was made. 100 µl of medium in the torsion-control group (T-CG) and 100 µl of exosome in the treatment group (TG) were injected into the testicular parenchyma after detorsion. Johnsen scores of testicles were determined. Apoptosis was evaluated by the TUNEL method.It was observed that the seminiferous tubule structures were partially disrupted in T-CG, but normal in SG and TG. Johnsen scores in SG, T-CG, and TG were 8.64 ± 0.39, 7.71 ± 0.37, and 8.57 ± 0.39, respectively. Apoptotic cell distribution was 11.28 ± 5.25%, 60.58% ± 1.68% and 17.71 ± 8.34% in SG, T-CG and TG, respectively. In both parameters, the difference between SG and TG was insignificant (p > 0.05), the difference between T-CG/TG and SG/T-CG was significant (p < 0.05).Exosomes obtained from AD-MSCs are effective in preventing testicular I/R injury. This effect appears to occur because of suppression of apoptotic activity.","['Apoptosis', 'Exosome', 'Ischemia–reperfusion', 'Testicular torsion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37222829,Therapeutic Effects of Shenfu Injection in Shock.,"Shock is the clinical manifestation of acute circulatory failure, which results in inadequate utilization of cellular oxygen. It is a common condition with high mortality rates in intensive care units. The intravenous administration of Shenfu Injection (SFI) may attenuate inflammation, regulate hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism; inhibit ischemia-reperfusion responses; and have adaptogenic and antiapoptotic effects. In this review, we have discussed the clinical applications and antishock pharmacological effects of SFI. Further in-depth and large-scale multicenter clinical studies are warranted to determine the therapeutic effects of SFI on shock.","['Chinese medicine', 'Shenfu Injection', 'pathophysiology', 'shock']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37221849,Liver transcriptomic and methylomic analyses identify transcriptional mitogen-activated protein kinase regulation in facultative hibernation of Syrian hamster.,"Hibernation consists of alternating torpor-arousal phases, during which animals cope with repetitive hypothermia and ischaemia-reperfusion. Due to limited transcriptomic and methylomic information for facultative hibernators, we here conducted RNA and whole-genome bisulfide sequencing in liver of hibernating Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Gene ontology analysis was performed on 844 differentially expressed genes and confirmed the shift in metabolic fuel utilization, inhibition of RNA transcription and cell cycle regulation as found in seasonal hibernators. Additionally, we showed a so far unreported suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein phosphatase 1 pathways during torpor. Notably, hibernating hamsters showed upregulation of MAPK inhibitors (dual-specificity phosphatases and sproutys) and reduced levels of MAPK-induced transcription factors (TFs). Promoter methylation was found to modulate the expression of genes targeted by these TFs. In conclusion, we document gene regulation between hibernation phases, which may aid the identification of pathways and targets to prevent organ damage in transplantation or ischaemia-reperfusion.","['DNA methylation', 'cell cycle', 'facultative hibernator', 'gene regulation', 'torpor', 'transcription factor-binding sites']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37221836,Toll-like receptor 4 induction during renal ischemia correlates with serum creatinine in a pig model.,"To determine whether toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a mediator of organ ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), is overexpressed during warm ischemia in a porcine solitary kidney model, and whether its expression correlates with creatinine, a surrogate for kidney function.Eight adult Yorkshire pigs underwent initial laparoscopic nephrectomy. After 1 week, animals were randomized into 2 groups: group 1 underwent laparoscopic renal hilar dissection, renal ischemia by cross-clamping, and reperfusion (ischemia group); group 2 underwent laparoscopic renal hilar dissection alone (sham group). Animals were survived to day 7 post-randomization. Peripheral blood was sampled for serum creatinine (sCr) and TLR4 expression at the following time points or corresponding intervals: pre-nephrectomy, 1-week post-nephrectomy (pre-ischemia), after 90 minutes of ischemia, 30 minutes post-reperfusion and at sacrifice. Intra-group TLR4 expression changes were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Inter-group TLR4 expression was compared using Mann-Whitney's test. Correlation between sCr and TLR4 was assessed using Spearman's test.Seven animals successfully completed the experiment (4 ischemia, 3 sham). Relative TLR4 expression significantly increased from baseline levels during ischemia, reperfusion and sacrifice time points only in the ischemia group, and was significantly higher for the ischemia group after 90 minutes of ischemia (p=0.034). sCr was significantly higher for the ischemia group during the reperfusion phase (p=0.048). Relative TLR4 expression level significantly correlated with sCr in the overall cohort (Spearman's rho = 0.69) and in the ischemia group (Spearman's rho = 0.82), (p<0.0001 for each).Warm ischemia in a porcine solitary kidney induces acute overexpression of TLR4 in peripheral blood leukocytes which is detectable. Relative TLR4 expression level strongly correlated with sCr, but had an observable change sooner than change in sCr. Pending further investigation, TLR4 overexpression during renal ischemia may represent a sensitive, quantitative marker of unilateral renal injury sustained during nephron-sparing surgery.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37221693,DDX3X Deficiency attenuates Pyroptosis Induced by Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation in N2a Cells.,"NOD‑like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis is strongly related to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. DDX3X, the DEAD-box family's ATPase/RNA helicase, promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, whether DDX3X deficiency attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis induced by cerebral I/R injury.This study investigated whether DDX3X deficiency attenuates NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in N2a cells after oxygen-glucose deprivation/ reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment.In vitro model of cerebral I/R injury, mouse neuro2a (N2a) cells subjected to OGD/R were treated with the knockdown of DDX3X. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay were conducted to measure cell viability and membrane permeability. Double immunofluorescence was performed to determine the pyroptotic cells. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to observe morphological changes of pyroptosis. Pyroptosis-associated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.The OGD/R treatment reduced cell viability, increased pyroptotic cells and released LDH compared to the control group. TEM showed membrane pore formation of pyroptosis. Immunofluorescence showed that GSDMD was translocated from the cytoplasm to the membrane after OGD/R treatment. Western blotting showed that the expression of DDX3X, and pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3, cleaved-Caspase1, and GSDMD-N) were increased after OGD/R treatment. Nevertheless, DDX3X knockdown markedly improved cell viability and reduced LDH release, expression of pyroptosis-related proteins, and N2a cells pyroptosis. DDX3X knockdown significantly inhibited membrane pore formation and GSDMD translocation from cytoplasm to membrane.This research demonstrates for the first time that DDX3X knockdown attenuates OGD/R‑induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis, which implies that DDX3X may become a potential therapeutic target for cerebral I/R injury.","['DDX3X', 'Immunofluorescence', 'NLRP3', 'OGD/R', 'cell viability', 'pyroptosis']",2023-04-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37218848,Fiber-Type-Specific Hypertrophy with the Use of Low-Load Blood Flow Restriction Resistance Training: A Systematic Review.,"Emerging evidence indicates that the use of low-load resistance training in combination with blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) can be an effective method to elicit increases in muscle size, with most research showing similar whole muscle development of the extremities compared to high-load (HL) training. It is conceivable that properties unique to LL-BFR such as greater ischemia, reperfusion, and metabolite accumulation may enhance the stress on type I fibers during training compared to the use of LLs without occlusion. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper was to systematically review the relevant literature on the fiber-type-specific response to LL-BFR and provide insights into future directions for research. A total of 11 studies met inclusion criteria. Results of the review suggest that the magnitude of type I fiber hypertrophy is at least as great, and sometimes greater, than type II hypertrophy when performing LL-BFR. This finding is in contrast to HL training, where the magnitude of type II fiber hypertrophy tends to be substantially greater than that of type I myofibers. However, limited data directly compare training with LL-BFR to nonoccluded LL or HL conditions, thus precluding the ability to draw strong inferences as to whether the absolute magnitude of type I hypertrophy is indeed greater in LL-BFR vs. traditional HL training. Moreover, it remains unclear as to whether combining LL-BFR with traditional HL training may enhance whole muscle hypertrophy via greater increases in type I myofiber cross-sectional area.","['cross-sectional area', 'fiber type', 'katsu', 'muscle growth', 'occlusion']",2023-03-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37218597,Periosteum-derived mesenchymal stem cell alleviates renal fibrosis through mTOR-mediated Treg differentiation.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the hotspots of cellular therapy due to their low immunogenicity, potent immunoregulation, and unique renoprotection. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of periosteum-derived MSCs (PMSCs) in ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-mediated renal fibrosis.Using cell proliferation assay, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and histologic analysis, the differences in cell characteristics, immunoregulation, and renoprotection of PMSCs were compared to the bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs), the most frequently studied stem cells in cellular therapy. In addition, the mechanism of PMSC renoprotection was investigated by 5' end of the RNA transcript sequencing (SMART-seq) and mTOR knockout mice.The proliferation and differentiation capabilities of PMSCs were stronger than those of BMSCs. Compared with BMSCs, the PMSCs exerted a better effect on alleviating renal fibrosis. Meanwhile, the PMSCs more effectively promote Treg differentiation. Treg exhaustion experiment indicated that Tregs exerted an important effect on inhibiting renal inflammation and acted as a critical mediator in PMSC renoprotection. Additionally, SMART-seq results implied that the PMSCs promoted Treg differentiation, possibly via the mTOR pathway. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that PMSC inhibited mTOR phosphorylation of Treg. After mTOR knockout, the PMSCs failed to promote Treg differentiation.Compared with BMSCs, the PMSCs exerted stronger immunoregulation and renoprotection that was mainly attributed to PMSC promotion for Treg differentiation by inhibiting the mTOR pathway.","['Renal fibrosis', 'ischemia–reperfusion', 'kidney transplantation', 'mTOR', 'mesenchymal stem cell', 'regulatory T cells']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37218423,Concomitant inhibition of TLR-4 and SGLT2 by phloretin and empagliflozin prevents diabetes-associated ischemic acute kidney injury.,"Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated kidney diseases. The purpose of this study was to explore the role and effect of phloretin, a TLR4 inhibitor, as an adjuvant therapy to empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) under diabetic conditions. To achieve this, firstly we induced type 1 diabetes using streptozotocin (55 mg per kg per intraperitoneally (i.p.)) followed by performing bilateral ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury to induce AKI in male Wistar rats. Treatment with phloretin (50 and 100 mg per kg per orally) and empagliflozin (10 mgper kg per orally) alone or in combination was administered to the diabetic rats for 4 days and 1 h before surgery. Moreover, a hypoxia-reperfusion injury was induced using sodium azide in NRK52E cells under a hyperglycemic environment to mimic the in vivo model. The cells were treated with phloretin (50 μM) and empagliflozin (100 nM) for 24 h. For biochemical analysis, plasma and urine samples were used. The kidney tissues were used to perform immunoblotting, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Other experiments like immunofluorescence, cell viability assay, and flow cytometry analysis were performed using the in vitro samples. The study outcomes revealed that compared to monotherapy, combination therapy of phloretin and empagliflozin was significantly effective. Phloretin and empagliflozin target the HMGB1/TLR4/MyD88/IK-β/α/NF-κB pathway to reduce inflammation and apoptosis, in addition to their antihyperglycemic effect. Thus, phloretin, a natural dietary supplement, as an adjuvant therapy to empagliflozin can be helpful to reduce empagliflozin-associated side effects, by reducing its clinical dose and increasing its therapeutic efficacy in AKI-diabetes comorbidity.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37218378,KATP channels are regulators of programmed cell death and targets for creation of novel drugs against ischemia/reperfusion cardiac injury.,"The use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with mortality rate of 5-7%. It is clear that there is an urgent need to develop new drugs that can effectively prevent cardiac reperfusion injury. ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP ) channel openers (KCOs) can be classified as such drugs. KCOs prevent irreversible ischemia and reperfusion injury of the heart. KATP channel opening promotes inhibition of apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and stimulation of autophagy. KCOs prevent the development of cardiac adverse remodeling and improve cardiac contractility during reperfusion. KCOs exhibit antiarrhythmic properties and prevent the appearance of the no-reflow phenomenon in animals with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Diabetes mellitus and a cholesterol-enriched diet abolish the cardioprotective effect of KCOs. Nicorandil, a KCO, attenuate major adverse cardiovascular event and the no-reflow phenomenon, reduces infarct size, decreases the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The cardioprotective effect of KCOs is mediated by opening of mitochondrial KATP (mitoKATP ) and sarcolemmal KATP (sarcKATP ) channels, triggered free radicals' production, and kinases activation.","['KATP channels', 'cardiac remodeling', 'heart', 'microvascular obstruction', 'programmed cell death', 'reperfusion']",2023-02-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37218204,Total saponins of Panax notoginseng modulate the astrocyte inflammatory signaling pathway and attenuate inflammatory injury induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion injury in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells.,"Reperfusion after cerebral ischemia causes brain injury. Total saponins of Panax notoginseng (PNS) have potential roles in protecting against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, whether PNS regulates astrocytes on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and its mechanism still need further clarification.Rat C6 glial cells were treated with PNS at different doses. Cell models were established by exposing C6 glial cells and BMECs to OGD/R. Cell viability was assessed, and levels of nitrite concentration, inflammatory factors (iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α), and oxidative stress-related factors (MDA, SOD, GSH-Px, T-AOC) were subsequently measured through CCK8, Grice analysis, Western blot, and ELISA, respectively. The co-cultured C6 and endothelial cells were treated with PNS for 24 hours before model establishment. Then transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) content, and mRNA and protein levels and positive rates of tight junction proteins [Claudin-5, Occludin, ZO-1] were measured by a cell resistance meter, corresponding kits, ELISA, RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry, respectively.PNS had no cytotoxicity. PNS reduced iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels in astrocytes, promoted T-AOC level and SOD and GSH-Px activities, and inhibited MDA levels, thus inhibiting oxidative stress in astrocytes. In addition, PNS alleviated OGD/R injury, reduced Na-Flu permeability, and enhanced TEER, LDH activity, BDNF content, and levels of tight junction proteins Claudin-5, Occludin, ZO-1 in the culture system of astrocytes and rat BMECs after OGD/R.PNS repressed astrocyte inflammation and attenuated OGD/R injury in rat BMECs.","['.

37217006,Therapeutic reconditioning of damaged lungs by transient heat stress during ex-vivo lung perfusion.,"Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) may serve as a platform for the pharmacological repair of lung grafts before transplantation (LTx). We hypothesized that EVLP could also permit non-pharmacological repair through the induction of a heat shock response, which confers stress adaptation via the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Therefore, we evaluated whether transient heat application during EVLP (thermal preconditioning, TP) might recondition damaged lungs before LTx. TP was performed during EVLP (3h) of rat lungs damaged by warm ischemia, by transiently heating (30 min, 41.5°) the EVLP perfusate, followed by LTx (2h reperfusion). We also assessed TP (30 min, 42°) during EVLP (4h) of swine lungs damaged by prolonged cold ischemia. In rat lungs, TP induced HSP expression, reduced NFκB and inflammasome activity, oxidative stress, epithelial injury, inflammatory cytokines, necroptotic death signaling, and the expression of genes involved in innate immune and cell death pathways. After LTx, heated lungs displayed reduced inflammation, edema, histological damage, improved compliance, but unchanged oxygenation. In pig lungs, TP induced HSP expression, reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, epithelial damage, vascular resistance, and ameliorated compliance. Collectively, these data indicate that transient heat application during EVLP promotes significant reconditioning of damaged lungs and improves their outcomes after transplantation.","['Animal model', 'Ex-vivo lung perfusion', 'Heat shock proteins', 'Lung transplantation', 'gene expression']",2023-01-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37215881,Connexin 43 dephosphorylation at serine 282 induces spontaneous arrhythmia and increases susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Connexin 43 (Cx43), the predominant gap junction protein in hearts, is modified by specific (de)phosphorylation events under physiological and pathological states to affect myocardium function and structure. Previously we found that deficiency in Cx43 S282 phosphorylation could impair intercellular communication and contribute to cardiomyocyte apoptosis by activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/factor-associated suicide (Fas)/Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain (FADD) pathway, which is involved in myocardium injury in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) heart. In addition, mutant at Cx43 S282 substituted with alanine heterozygous mice (S282A+/-) exhibited different degrees of ventricular arrhythmias and only some underwent myocardium apoptosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Cx43 pS282 in different cardiac pathological phenotypes.We examined cardiac function, structure, and relevant protein expression in S282A+/- mice (aged 2, 10 and 30 weeks) by electrocardiograph, echocardiography, histological staining, and co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot. Intraperitoneal isoprenaline injection and I/R surgery were applied in S282A+/- mice as external stimulus. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used for myocardium infarction evaluation.Adult S282A+/- mice (aged 10 and 30 weeks) still exhibited spontaneous arrhythmia. Unlike neonatal stage (aged around 2 weeks), no apoptosis-related manifestations and the activation of p38 MAPK-Fas-FADD apoptotic pathway were observed in adult S282A+/- hearts. S282A+/- neonatal mice with cardiomyocytes apoptosis exhibited more than 60% dephosphorylation at Cx43 S282 than WT mice, while less than 40% S282 dephosphorylation were found in adult S282A+/- mice. In addition, although S282A+/- mice displayed normal cardiac function, they were highly susceptible to isoproterenol-induced ECG alternans and prone to cardiac injury and deaths upon I/R attack.These results reinforce that Cx43 S282 dephosphorylation acts as a susceptibility factor in regulating cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac electrical homeostasis in basal conditions and contributes to myocardium injury in the setting of I/R. Cx43 S282 phosphorylation was competent to induce spontaneous arrhythmias, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and deaths based on the degree of S282 dephosphorylation.","['Apoptosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Connexin 43', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Phosphorylation']",2023-03-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37215853,Emodin prevents renal ischemia-reperfusion injury via suppression of p53-mediated cell apoptosis based on network pharmacology.,"Previous evidence indicated that emodin has significant advantages for preventing acute kidney injury (AKI). However, the mechanisms responsible for these effects of emodin have yet to be elucidated.We first used network pharmacology and molecular docking to identify the core targets of emodin for AKI and performed a range of experiments to validate this result. Pretreatment with emodin for 7 days, the rats were treated with bilateral renal artery clipping for 45 min to identify the prevention effect. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), and vancomycin - induced renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) were treated with emodin to explore the related molecular mechanism.Network pharmacology and molecular docking showed that anti-apoptosis might be the core mechanism responsible for the action of emodin on AKI; this anti-apoptotic effect appears to because by regulation p53-related signaling pathway. Our data showed that pretreatment with emodin significantly improved renal function and renal tubular injury in renal I/R model rats (P < 0.05. The prevention effect of emodin was proved to be related to anti - apoptosis of HK-2 cells, possibly by downregulating the levels of p53, cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, and upregulated the levels of Bcl-2. The efficacy and mechanism of emodin on anti - apoptosis was also confirmed in vancomycin - induced HK-2 cells. Meanwhile, the data also showed that emodin promoted angiogenesis in I/R damaged kidneys and H/R-induced HK-2 cells, which was associated with decreasing HIF-1α levels and increasing VEGF levels.Our findings indicated that the preventive effect of emodin on AKI is probably attributable to anti-apoptosis response and promoting angiogenesis effect.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Angiogenesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Emodin', 'Molecular docking', 'Network pharmacology']",2022-08-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37215581,MOF-derived bimetallic nanozyme to catalyze ROS scavenging for protection of myocardial injury.,"Rationale: Myocardial injury triggers intense oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and cytokine release, which are essential for myocardial repair and remodeling. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and inflammation elimination have long been considered to reverse myocardial injuries. However, the efficacy of traditional treatments (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory drugs and natural enzymes) is still poor due to their intrinsic defects such as unfavorable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, low biological stability, and potential side effects. Nanozyme represents a candidate to effectively modulate redox homeostasis for the treatment of ROS related inflammation diseases. Methods: We develop an integrated bimetallic nanozyme derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) to eliminate ROS and alleviate inflammation. The bimetallic nanozyme (Cu-TCPP-Mn) is synthesized by embedding manganese and copper into the porphyrin followed by sonication, which could mimic the cascade activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to transform oxygen radicals to hydrogen peroxide, followed by the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. Enzyme kinetic analysis and oxygen-production velocities analysis were performed to evaluate the enzymatic activities of Cu-TCPP-Mn. We also established myocardial infarction (MI) and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury animal models to verify the ROS scavenging and anti-inflammation effect of Cu-TCPP-Mn. Results: As demonstrated by kinetic analysis and oxygen-production velocities analysis, Cu-TCPP-Mn nanozyme possesses good performance in both SOD- and CAT-like activities to achieve synergistic ROS scavenging effect and provide protection for myocardial injury. In both MI and I/R injury animal models, this bimetallic nanozyme represents a promising and reliable technology to protect the heart tissue from oxidative stress and inflammation-induced injury, and enables the myocardial function to recover from otherwise severe damage. Conclusions: This research provides a facile and applicable method to develop a bimetallic MOF nanozyme, which represents a promising alternative to the treatment of myocardial injuries.","['metal-organic framework', 'myocardial injury', 'nanomedicine', 'nanozyme', 'reactive oxygen species']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37214302,Near-infrared laser-irradiated upconversion nanoparticles with dexamethasone precise released for alleviating lung ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Introduction: Dexamethasone (DEX), as an important enduring-effect glucocorticoid (GC), holds great promise in the field of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) comprehensive therapy owing to its immunomodulatory properties, such as inducing apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. However, its potent anti-inflammatory application is still restricted because of multiple internal physiologic barriers. Methods: Herein, we developed upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) coated with photosensitizer/capping agent/fluorescent probe-modified mesoporous silica (UCNPs@mSiO2[DEX]-Py/β-CD/FITC, USDPFs) for precise DEX release synergistic LIRI comprehensive therapy. The UCNPs were designed by covering an inert YOF:Yb shell on the YOF:Yb, Tm core to achieve high-intensity blue and red upconversion emission upon Near-Infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. Results: Under suitable compatibility conditions, the molecular structure of photosensitizer can be damaged along with capping agent shedding, which endowed USDPFs with an outstanding capability to carry out DEX release controlling and fluorescent indicator targeting. Furthermore, the hybrid encapsulating of DEX significantly increased utilization of nano-drugs, improving the water solubility and bioavailability, which was conducive to developing the anti-inflammatory performance of USDPFs in the complex clinical environment. Discussion: The response-controlled release of DEX in the intrapulmonary microenvironment can reduce normal cell damage, which can effectively avoid the side effects of nano-drugs in anti-inflammatory application. Meanwhile, the multi-wavelength of UCNPs endowed nano-drugs with the fluorescence emission imaging capacity in an intrapulmonary microenvironment, providing precise guidance for LIRI.","['dexamethasone', 'inflammation', 'lung ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'near-infrared', 'response-controlled release', 'upconversion nanoparticles']",2023-03-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37212369,Association between artificial nutrition in brain dead donors and early allograft function in liver transplant recipients: an observational study.,"The role of nutrition in donor after brain deaths (DBDs) has yet to be adequately discussed. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the nutritional intake in the 48 h before organ retrieval may play a role on the graft functional recovery assessed with Model for Early Allograft Function (MEAF) Score.Single-center retrospective study evaluating all liver transplants performed at the University Hospital of Udine from January 2010 to August 2020. Patients receiving grafts from DBD donors fed with artificial enteral nutrition in the 48 h prior to organ procurement (EN-group) or who did not (No-EN-group). Caloric debt was calculated using the difference between the calculated caloric needs and the effective calories delivered through enteral nutrition.Livers from EN-group presented a lower mean MEAF score compared to the no-EN-group: 3.39 ± 1.46 versus 4.15 ± 1.51, respectively (p = .04). A positive correlation between caloric debt and the MEAF score was found within the overall population (r = .227, p = .043) as well as in EN-group (r = .306, p = .049).Donor's nutritional intake in the final 48 h before organ procurement correlates with MEAF score, and nutrition probably plays a positive role on the functional recovery of the graft. Large future randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this preliminary results.","['brain dead donor', 'cirrhosis', 'critically ill patient', 'donor management', 'donor risk index', 'enteral nutrition', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'liver transplantation', 'organ procurement']",2022-07-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

We investigated the potential renoprotective effect of nebivolol, a β1 adrenergic receptor blocker, against renal I-R injury. We focused on the role of nebivolol in activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, Akt (protein kinase B) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) transcription factors, which contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis during renal I-R. We divided 20 adult male Wistar albino rats into three experimental groups. Group 1 was a sham control in which only laparotomy was performed. Group 2 was the I-R group in which both kidneys were made ischemic for 45 min, then reperfused for 24 h. Group 3 was the I-R + nebivolol group in which 10 mg/kg nebivolol was administrated by gavage for 7 days before I-R. We measured Inflammation, oxidative stress and active caspase-3 as well as activation of p38 MAPK, Akt (protein kinase B) and NFκB transcription factor. Nebivolol significantly reduced oxidative stress and increased superoxide dismutase levels during renal I-R. We found that nebivolol significantly decreased interstitial inflammation, and TNF-α and interleukin-1β mRNA expression. Nebivolol significantly reduced active caspase-3 and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) expressions. Nebivolol also significantly decreased activation of p38 MAPK signaling and NFκB, and induced Akt activation during renal I-R. Our findings suggest that nebivolol may be useful for management of renal I-R injury.","['Akt', 'NFκB', 'ischemia', 'kidney', 'nebivolol', 'p38 MAPK', 'rat', 'renoprotection', 'reperfusion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37211082,Head Down Tilt 15° in Acute Ischemic Stroke with Poor Collaterals: A Randomized Preclinical Trial.,"Cerebral collaterals are recruited after arterial occlusion with a protective effect on tissue outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Head down tilt 15° (HDT15) is a simple, low cost and accessible procedure that could be applied as an emergency treatment, before recanalization therapies, with the aim to increase cerebral collateral flow. Spontaneously hypertensive rats have been shown to display anatomical differences in morphology and function of cerebral collaterals, compared to other rat strains, resulting in an overall poor collateral circulation. We investigate the efficacy and safety of HDT15 in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, which were considered as an animal stroke model with poor collaterals. Cerebral ischemia was induced by 90 minute endovascular occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). SHR rats were randomized to HDT15 or flat position (n = 19). HDT15 was applied 30 minutes after occlusion and lasted 60 minutes, until reperfusion. HDT15 application increased cerebral perfusion (+16.6% versus +6.1%; p = 0.0040) and resulted in a small reduction of infarct size (83.6 versus 107.1 mm3; - 21.89%; p = 0.0272), but it was not associated with early neurological improvement, compared to flat position.

37210762,KLF10 knockdown negatively regulates CTRP3 to improve OGD/R-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell injury and barrier dysfunction through Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.,"Ischemic stroke seriously endangers human health and even death. This study aimed to investigate the role of KLF10/CTRP3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced brain microvascular endothelial cells injury, as well as the regulatory effects of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. OGD/R-induced human microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) were used to simulate the model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The expression of KLF10/CTRP3 in OGD/R-induced hBMECs as well as the transfection efficiency were all detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. The interaction of KLF10 and CTRP3 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The viability, apoptosis and endothelial permeability of OGD/R-induced hBMECs was detected by CCK-8, TUNEL and FITC-Dextran assay kit. The capacity of cell migration was assessed by wound healing assay. The expression of apoptosis related proteins, oxidative stress levels and tight junction proteins was also detected. As a result, the expression of KLF10 was increased in OGD/R-induced hBMECs and downregulation of KLF10 could promote the viability, migration and suppress the apoptosis, oxidative stress and endothelial permeability by downregulating the expression of caspase 3, Bax, cleaved PARP, ROS, MDA, and upregulating the expression of Bcl-2, SOD, GSH-Px, ZO-1, occludin, claudin-5. Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was inhibited in OGD/R-induced hBMECs, which was activated by downregulation of KLF10. KLF10 was demonstrated to be combined with CTRP3 and KLF10 inhibited transcription of CTRP3 in hBMECs. The above changes affected by downregulation of KLF10 could be reversed by the interference with CTRP3. In conclusion, KLF10 knockdown improved OGD/R-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell injury and barrier dysfunction through the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, which was weakened by the downregulation of CTRP3.","['Brain microvascular endothelial cells', 'CTRP3', 'KLF10', 'Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway', 'Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation (OGD/R)']",2022-12-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) parameters in the tissue were analyzed to investigate the oxidative stress occurring in the liver, pancreas, and heart, and Acyl-Coa synthetase long-chain family member (ACSL4). Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) enzyme levels were also analyzed by ELISA to investigate the effect on ferroptosis. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed for histopathological examination of the tissues. As a result of biochemical analyzes, it was observed that oxidative stress parameters increased significantly in the IR group. In addition, while the ACSL4 enzyme level increased in the IR group in all tissues, the GPx4 enzyme level decreased. In the histopathological examination, it was observed that IR caused serious damage to the heart, liver, and pancreas tissues. The present study shows that Curcumin and LoxBlock-1 have a protective effect on the liver, pancreas, and cardiac ferroptosis following the effect on AKI. In addition, Curcumin was found to be more effective than LoxBlock-1 in I/R injury with its antioxidant property.","['AKI', 'Curcumin', 'Ferroptosis', 'LoxBlock-1', 'Renal IR']",2022-11-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37210237,Severe muscle damage after a short period of ischemia and reperfusion in an animal model.,"Skeletal muscle ischemia-reperfusion injuries result in a loss of contractile function, leading to limb disability or amputation. Ischemia causes hypoxia and cellular energy failure, which is aggravated by reperfusion due to the inflammatory response and oxidative stress. The consequences of the injury vary according to the duration of the period of ischemia and reperfusion. Therefore, the present work aims to evaluate ischemia-reperfusion injuries induced in the skeletal muscles of Wistar rats submitted to 3 different application periods based on morphological and biochemical parameters.For this, a tourniquet was applied to the root of the animals' hind limbs, occluding arterial and venous blood flow, and it was followed by reperfusion-the removal of the tourniquet. The groups were: control (without tourniquet); I30'/R60' (30 minutes of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion); I120'/R120' (2 hours and 2 hours); and I180'/R180' (3 hours and 3 hours).All ischemia-reperfusion groups showed characteristics of muscle injury. Microscopic analyses of the extensor digitorum longus, soleus, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles showed a significant increase in the number of injured muscle fibers in the ischemia-reperfusion groups compared to the control group. There were also significant differences between the ischemia-reperfusion groups in all muscles, showing a progressive increase in the degree of injury. The quantification of the number of injured muscle fibers between the muscles revealed that at I30'/R60', the soleus muscles had a higher number of injuries in relation to the other muscles, with statistical significance. In the I120'/R120' group, the gastrocnemius muscles presented a significantly greater number of injured fibers. There were no significant differences in the I180'/R180' group. The serum levels of creatine kinase in the I180'/R180' group were significantly higher than in the control and I30'/R60' groups.Therefore, it was evident that the 3 ischemia-reperfusion models used were capable of causing cell damage, with these findings being more pronounced in the I180'/R180' group.",[],2022-12-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37209886,Birc3 and Tip1 are upregulated in renal ischemia reperfusion injury.,"Identification of ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R)-associated genes is essential for exploring I/R novel mechanisms. Previously, we screened differentially expressed genes in renal I/R mouse models and found that Tax1 binding protein 3 (Tip1) and baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (Birc3) are two upregulated genes in I/R. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of Tip1 and Birc3 in I/R models. We found that the expression of Tip1 and Birc3 was upregulated in I/R-treated mice, whereas Tip1 was downregulated and Birc3 was upregulated in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro models. By inhibiting Birc3 with AT-406 in I/R-treated mice, we observed that the serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen did not vary. However, inhibition of Birc3 enhanced apoptosis of kidney tissues induced by I/R treatment. Consistently, we found that inhibition of Birc3 also increased the apoptosis rate in tubular epithelial cells induced by OGD/R. These data demonstrated that Tip1 and Birc3 were upregulated in I/R injury. The upregulation of Birc3 may protect against renal I/R injury.","['Apoptosis', 'Birc3', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Renal transplantation', 'Tip1']",2022-11-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37208955,Delayed CO2 postconditioning promotes neurological recovery after cryogenic traumatic brain injury by downregulating IRF7 expression.,"Few treatments are available in the subacute phase of traumatic brain injury (TBI) except rehabilitation training. We previously reported that transient CO2 inhalation applied within minutes after reperfusion has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, it was hypothesized that delayed CO2 postconditioning (DCPC) starting at the subacute phase may promote neurological recovery of TBI.Using a cryogenic TBI (cTBI) model, mice received DCPC daily by inhaling 5%/10%/20% CO2 for various time-courses (one/two/three cycles of 10-min inhalation/10-min break) at Days 3-7, 3-14 or 7-18 after cTBI. Beam walking and gait tests were used to assess the effect of DCPC. Lesion size, expression of GAP-43 and synaptophysin, amoeboid microglia number and glia scar area were detected. Transcriptome and recombinant interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) adeno-associated virus were applied to investigate the molecular mechanisms.DCPC significantly promoted recovery of motor function in a concentration and time-course dependent manner with a wide therapeutic time window of at least 7 days after cTBI. The beneficial effects of DCPC were blocked by intracerebroventricular injection of NaHCO3 . DCPC also increased puncta density of GAP-43 and synaptophysin, and reduced amoeboid microglia number and glial scar formation in the cortex surrounding the lesion. Transcriptome analysis showed many inflammation-related genes and pathways were altered by DCPC, and Irf7 was a hub gene, while overexpression of IRF7 blocked the motor function improvement of DCPC.We first showed that DCPC promoted functional recovery and brain tissue repair, which opens a new therapeutic time window of postconditioning for TBI. Inhibition of IRF7 is a key molecular mechanism for the beneficial effects of DCPC, and IRF7 may be a potential therapeutic target for rehabilitation after TBI.","['brain tissue repair', 'delayed CO2 postconditioning', 'interferon regulatory factor 7', 'traumatic brain injury']",2023-01-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

They were assigned to two groups to receive PCI plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) and OMT alone respectively. Clinical outcomes at 30 days and 1 year were compared between two groups, and hazard ratio for survival was analyzed using Cox regression model. A power analysis demanded 34 patients in each group to produce a power of 90% and a P value of 0.05.The 30-day mortality was significantly lower in PCI group (n = 126) than in non-PCI group (n = 38) (11.1% versus 28.9%, P = 0.018), while there was no significant difference in the 1-year mortality and incidence of cardiovascular comorbidities between the two groups. Cox regression analysis showed that patients with IRF didn't benefit from receiving PCI on survival rate (P = 0.267).Delayed PCI is not beneficial on one-year clinical outcomes for STEMI patients with IRF.","['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Late reperfusion', 'Percutaneous coronary intervention', 'Renal function']",2022-09-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37208105,Machine perfusion of the liver and bioengineering.,"With the increasing number of accepted candidates on waiting lists worldwide, there is an urgent need to expand the number and the quality of donor livers. Dynamic preservation approaches have demonstrated various benefits, including improving liver function and graft survival, and reducing liver injury and post-transplant complications. Consequently, organ perfusion techniques are being used in clinical practice in many countries. Despite this success, a proportion of livers do not meet current viability tests required for transplantation, even with the use of modern perfusion techniques. Therefore, devices are needed to further optimise machine liver perfusion - one promising option is to prolong machine liver perfusion for several days, with ex situ treatment of perfused livers. For example, stem cells, senolytics, or molecules targeting mitochondria or downstream signalling can be administered during long-term liver perfusion to modulate repair mechanisms and regeneration. Besides, today's perfusion equipment is also designed to enable the use of various liver bioengineering techniques, to develop scaffolds or for their re-cellularisation. Cells or entire livers can also undergo gene modulation to modify animal livers for xenotransplantation, to directly treat injured organs or to repopulate such scaffolds with ""repaired"" autologous cells. This review first discusses current strategies to improve the quality of donor livers, and secondly reports on bioengineering techniques to design optimised organs during machine perfusion. Current practice, as well as the benefits and challenges associated with these different perfusion strategies are discussed.","['Liver transplantation', 'bioengineering', 'ischemia-reperfusion-injury', 'machine perfusion', 'mitochondria', 'organoids', 'regeneration medicine', 'scaffolding']",2022-12-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37207230,HBSP improves kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury and promotes repair in properdin deficient mice via enhancing phagocytosis of tubular epithelial cells.,"Phagocytosis plays vital roles in injury and repair, while its regulation by properdin and innate repair receptor, a heterodimer receptor of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR)/β common receptor (βcR), in renal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) remains unclear. Properdin, a pattern recognition molecule, facilitates phagocytosis by opsonizing damaged cells. Our previous study showed that the phagocytic function of tubular epithelial cells isolated from properdin knockout (PKO) mouse kidneys was compromised, with upregulated EPOR in IR kidneys that was further raised by PKO at repair phase. Here, helix B surface peptide (HBSP), derived from EPO only recognizing EPOR/βcR, ameliorated IR-induced functional and structural damage in both PKO and wild-type (WT) mice. In particular, HBSP treatment led to less cell apoptosis and F4/80+ macrophage infiltration in the interstitium of PKO IR kidneys compared to the WT control. In addition, the expression of EPOR/βcR was increased by IR in WT kidneys, and furthered increased in IR PKO kidneys, but greatly reduced by HBSP in the IR kidneys of PKO mice. HBSP also increased PCNA expression in IR kidneys of both genotypes. Moreover, iridium-labelled HBSP (HBSP-Ir) was localized mainly in the tubular epithelia after 17-h renal IR in WT mice. HBSP-Ir also anchored to mouse kidney epithelial (TCMK-1) cells treated by H2O2. Both EPOR and EPOR/βcR were significantly increased by H2O2 treatment, while further increased EPOR was showed in cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting properdin, but a lower level of EPOR was seen in EPOR siRNA and HBSP-treated cells. The number of early apoptotic cells was increased by EPOR siRNA in H2O2-treated TCMK-1, but markedly reversed by HBSP. The phagocytic function of TCMK-1 cells assessed by uptake fluorescence-labelled E.coli was enhanced by HBSP dose-dependently. Our data demonstrate for the first time that HBSP improves the phagocytic function of tubular epithelial cells and kidney repair post IR injury, via upregulated EPOR/βcR triggered by both IR and properdin deficiency.","['HBSP', 'innate repair receptor', 'ischaemia-reperfusion injury', 'phagocytosis', 'properdin', 'repair', 'tubular epithelial cells']",2023-03-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37206558,Sulforaphane alleviates lung ischemia‑reperfusion injury through activating Nrf‑2/HO‑1 signaling.,"Oxidative stress and inflammation are both involved in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural product with cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The present study hypothesized that SFN may protect against lung I/R injury via the regulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory-related pathways. A rat model of lung I/R injury was established, and rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Sham group, I/R group, and SFN group. It was shown that SFN protected against a pathological inflammatory response via inhibition of neutrophil accumulation and in the reduction of the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. SFN treatment also significantly inhibited lung reactive oxygen species production, decreased the levels of 8-OH-dG and malondialdehyde, and reversed the decrease in the antioxidant activities of the enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in the lungs of the I/R treated rats. In addition, SFN ameliorated I/R-induced lung apoptosis in rats by suppressing Bax and cleaved caspase-3 levels and increased Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, SFN treatment activated an Nrf2-related antioxidant pathway, as indicated by the increased nuclear transfer of Nrf2 and the downstream HO-1 and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1. In conclusion, these findings suggested that SFN protected against I/R-induced lung lesions in rats via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the accompanied anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.","['Nrf-2/HO-1', 'Sulforaphane', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'lung', 'reactive oxygen species']",2022-08-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37206232,Reactive oxygen species-responsive mitochondria-targeted liposomal quercetin attenuates retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury via regulating SIRT1/FOXO3A and p38 MAPK signaling pathways.,"Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) injury is involved in the pathogenesis of various vision-threatening diseases. The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be the main cause of RIR injury. A variety of natural products, including quercetin (Que), exhibit potent antioxidant activity. However, the lack of an efficient delivery system for hydrophobic Que and the presence of various intraocular barriers limit the effective retinal delivery of Que in clinical settings. In this study, we encapsulated Que into ROS-responsive mitochondria-targeted liposomes (abbreviated to Que@TPP-ROS-Lips) to achieve the sustained delivery of Que to the retina. The intracellular uptake, lysosome escape ability, and mitochondria targeting ability of Que@TPP-ROS-Lips were evaluated in R28 retinal cells. Treating R28 cells with Que@TPP-ROS-Lips significantly ameliorated the decrease in ATP content, ROS generation, and increase in the release of lactate dehydrogenase in an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of retinal ischemia. In a rat model, the intravitreal injection of Que@TPP-ROS-Lips 24 h after inducing retinal ischemia significantly enhanced retinal electrophysiological recovery and reduced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Que@TPP-ROS-Lips were taken up by retina for at least 14 days after intravitreal administration. Molecular docking and functional biological experiments revealed that Que targets FOXO3A to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation. Que@TPP-ROS-Lips also partially inhibited the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which contributes to oxidative stress and inflammation. In conclusion, our new platform for ROS-responsive and mitochondria-targeted drug release shows promise for the treatment of RIR injury and promotes the clinical application of hydrophobic natural products.","['FOXO3A', 'ROS‐responsive liposomes', 'mitochondria targeted', 'quercetin', 'retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury']",2022-06-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37206207,Non-invasive treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury: Effective transmission of therapeutic near-infrared light into the human brain through soft skin-conforming silicone waveguides.,"Noninvasive delivery of near-infrared light (IRL) to human tissues has been researched as a treatment for several acute and chronic disease conditions. We recently showed that use of specific IRL wavelengths, which inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX), leads to robust neuroprotection in animal models of focal and global brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. These life-threatening conditions can be caused by an ischemic stroke or cardiac arrest, respectively, two leading causes of death. To translate IRL therapy into the clinic an effective technology must be developed that allows efficient delivery of IRL to the brain while addressing potential safety concerns. Here, we introduce IRL delivery waveguides (IDWs) which meet these demands. We employ a low-durometer silicone that comfortably conforms to the shape of the head, avoiding pressure points. Furthermore, instead of using focal IRL delivery points via fiberoptic cables, lasers, or light-emitting diodes, the distribution of the IRL across the entire area of the IDW allows uniform IRL delivery through the skin and into the brain, preventing ""hot spots"" and thus skin burns. The IRL delivery waveguides have unique design features, including optimized IRL extraction step numbers and angles and a protective housing. The design can be scaled to fit various treatment areas, providing a novel IRL delivery interface platform. Using fresh (unfixed) human cadavers and isolated cadaver tissues, we tested transmission of IRL via IDWs in comparison to laser beam application with fiberoptic cables. Using the same IRL output energies IDWs performed superior in comparison to the fiberoptic delivery, leading to an up to 95% and 81% increased IRL transmission for 750 and 940 nm IRL, respectively, analyzed at a depth of 4 cm into the human head. We discuss the unique safety features and potential further improvements of the IDWs for future clinical implementation.","['cadaver', 'infrared light', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'light penetration', 'mitochondria', 'stroke', 'waveguide']",2022-09-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37206053,Is aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonism after ischemia effective in alleviating acute hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats?,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) have been reported to be important mediators of ischemic injury in the brain. Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of AhR activation after ischemia has been shown to attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Here, we investigated whether AhR antagonist administration after ischemia was also effective in ameliorating hepatic IR injury. A 70% partial hepatic IR (45-min ischemia and 24-h reperfusion) injury was induced in rats. We administered 6,2',4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF, 5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 10 min after ischemia. Hepatic IR injury was observed using serum, magnetic resonance imaging-based liver function indices, and liver samples. TMF-treated rats showed significantly lower relative enhancement (RE) values and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase levels than did untreated rats at 3 h after reperfusion. After 24 h of reperfusion, TMF-treated rats had significantly lower RE values, ΔT1 values, serum ALT levels, and necrotic area percentage than did untreated rats. The expression of the apoptosis-related proteins, Bax and cleaved caspase-3, was significantly lower in TMF-treated rats than in untreated rats. This study demonstrated that inhibition of AhR activation after ischemia was effective in ameliorating IR-induced liver injury in rats.","['Aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'Ischemia', 'L-kynurenine', 'Liver', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Reperfusion']",2022-04-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Ferroptosis, a novel mode of cell death elicited by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has been implicated in ischemic events. This study aimed to investigate the role of ferroptosis in LTx-CI/R injury and the effectiveness of liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), a ferroptosis inhibitor, in alleviating LTx-CI/R injury.LTx-CI/R-induced signal pathway alterations, tissue injury, cell death, inflammatory responses, and ferroptotic features were examined in human lung biopsies, the human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells, and the mouse LTx-CI/R model (24-h CI/4-h R). The therapeutic efficacy of Lip-1 was explored and validated both in vitro and in vivo.In human lung tissues, LTx-CI/R activated ferroptosis-related signaling pathway, increased the tissue iron content and lipid peroxidation accumulation, and altered key protein (GPX4, COX2, Nrf2, and SLC7A11) expression and mitochondrial morphology. In BEAS-2B cells, the hallmarks of ferroptosis were significantly evidenced at the setting of both CI and CI/R compared with the control, and the effect of adding Lip-1 only during CI was much better than that of only during reperfusion by Cell Counting Kit-8. Furthermore, Lip-1 administration during CI markedly relieved LTx-CI/R injury in mice, as indicated by significant improvement in lung pathological changes, pulmonary function, inflammation, and ferroptosis.This study revealed the existence of ferroptosis in the pathophysiology of LTx-CI/R injury. Using Lip-1 to inhibit ferroptosis during CI could ameliorate LTx-CI/R injury, suggesting that Lip-1 administration might be proposed as a new strategy for organ preservation.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37202752,Empagliflozin improves renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing inflammation and enhancing mitochondrial fusion through AMPK-OPA1 pathway promotion.,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one reason for renal transplantation failure. Recent studies have shown that mitochondrial dynamics is closely related to IRI, and that inhibition or reversal of mitochondrial division protects organs against IRI. Optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1), an important factor in mitochondrial fusion, has been shown to be upregulated by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). Also, the antiinflammatory effects of SGLT2i have been demonstrated in renal cells. Thus, we hypothesized that empagliflozin could prevent IRI through inhibiting mitochondrial division and reducing inflammation.Using hematoxylin-eosin staining, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, immunofluorescent staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, real-time PCR, RNA-sequencing, and western blot, we analyzed renal tubular tissue from in vivo and in vitro experiments.Through animal experiments and sequencing analysis, we first confirmed the protection against IRI and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics-related factors and inflammatory factors by empagliflozin pretreatment. Then, through hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cellular experiments, we confirmed that empagliflozin could inhibit mitochondrial shortening and division and upregulate OPA1 in human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) cells. Subsequently, we knocked down OPA1, and mitochondrial division and shortening were observed, which could be alleviated by empagliflozin treatment. Combined with the previous results, we concluded that OPA1 downregulation leads to mitochondrial division and shortening, and empagliflozin can alleviate the condition by upregulating OPA1. We further explored the pathway through which empagliflozin functions. Related studies have shown the activation of AMPK pathway by empagliflozin and the close correlation between the AMPK pathway and OPA1. In our study, we blocked the AMPK pathway, and OPA1 upregulation by empagliflozin was not observed, thus demonstrating the dependence of empagliflozin on the AMPK pathway.The results indicated that empagliflozin could prevent or alleviate renal IRI through antiinflammatory effects and the AMPK-OPA1 pathway. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an inevitable challenge in organ transplantation. It is necessary to develop a new therapeutic strategy for IRI prevention in addition to refining the transplantation process. In this study, we confirmed the preventive and protective effects of empagliflozin in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Based on these findings, empagliflozin is promising to be a preventive agent for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and can be applied for preemptive administration in kidney transplantation.","['AMPK signaling', 'Empagliflozin', 'Inflammation', 'Mitochondrial dynamics', 'OPA1', 'Renal ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'SGLT2i']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37201662,"Integrating UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS, network pharmacology and experimental validation to reveal the potential mechanism of Tibetan medicine Rhodiola granules in improving myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.","Rhodiola granules (RG) is a traditional Tibetan medicine prescription that can be used to improve the symptoms of ischemia and hypoxia in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. However, there is no report on its use to improve myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and its potential active ingredients and mechanism against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain unclear.This study aimed to reveal the potential bioactive components and underlying pharmacological mechanisms of RG in improving myocardial I/R injury through a comprehensive strategy.UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS technology was used to analyze the chemical components of RG, the potential bioactive components and targets were tracked and predicted by the SwissADME and SwissTargetPrediction databases, and the core targets were predicted through the PPI network, as well the functions and pathways were determined by GO and KEGG analysis. In addition, the molecular docking and ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery-induced rat I/R models were experimentally validated.A total of 37 ingredients were detected from RG, including nine flavones, ten flavonoid glycosides, one glycoside, eight organic acids, four amides, two nucleosides, one amino acid, and two other components. Among them, 15 chemical components, such as salidroside, morin, diosmetin, and gallic acid were identified as key active compounds. Ten core targets, including AKT1, VEGF, PTGS2, and STAT3, were discovered through the analysis of the PPI network constructed from 124 common potential targets. These possible targets were involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and HIF-1/VEGF/PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking confirmed that the potential bioactive compounds in RG have good potential binding abilities to AKT1, VEGFA, PTGS2, STAT3, and HIF-1α proteins. Then, the animal experiments showed that RG could significantly improve the cardiac function of I/R rats, reduce the size of myocardial infarction, improve the myocardial structure, and reduce the degree of myocardial fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and myocardial cell apoptosis rate in I/R rats. In addition, we also found that RG could decrease the concentration of AGE, Ox-LDL, MDA, MPO, XOD, SDH, Ca2+, and ROS, and increase the concentration of Trx, TrxR1, SOD, T-AOC, NO, ATP, Na+k+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and CCO. Moreover, RG could significantly down-regulate the expressions of Bax, Cleaved-caspase3, HIF-1α, and PTGS2, as well up-regulate the expressions of Bcl-2, VEGFA, p-AKT1, and p-STAT3.In summary, we revealed for the first time the potential active ingredients and mechanisms of RG for myocardial I/R injury therapy through a comprehensive research strategy. RG may synergistically improve myocardial I/R injury through anti-inflammatory, regulating energy metabolism, and oxidative stress, improving I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis, which may be related to the HIF-1/VEGF/PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our study provides new insights into the clinical application of RG and also provides a reference for the development and mechanism research of other Tibetan medicine compound preparations.","['Experimental validation', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Network pharmacology', 'Rhodiola granules', 'UPLC-Q-exactive orbitrap/MS']",2022-12-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37201357,Maintenance of cathepsin D-dependent autophagy-lysosomal function protects against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion(I/R) induced-cardiac vascular endothelial injury is an important pathological process that appears in the early stage of cardiac I/R injury. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. However, in cardiac I/R injury, the role of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is controversial. The present study aimed to use oxygen-glucose deprivation/oxygen-glucose resupply(OGD/OGR) in human coronary artery endothelial cells(HCAECs) with I/R injury to assess the role of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in I/R-induced endothelial injury. The results revealed lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux in endothelial cells exposed to OGD/OGR. Meanwhile, our data showed that the levels of cathepsin D(CTSD) decreased time-dependently. Knockdown of CTSD caused lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux. Conversely, restoration of CTSD levels protected HCAECs against OGD/OGR induced-defects in autophagy-lysosomal function and cellular damage. Our findings indicated that I/R induced-impaired autophagic flux, rather than excessive autophagic initiation, mediates endothelial cells injury.

37201263,Neocryptotanshinone ameliorates insufficient energy production in heart failure by targeting retinoid X receptor alpha.,"Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) is a nuclear transcription factor that extensively regulates energy metabolism in cardiovascular diseases. Identification of targeted RXRα drugs for heart failure (HF) therapy is urgently needed. Neocryptotanshinone (NCTS) is a component derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, the effect and mechanism of which for treating HF have not been reported. The goal of this study was to explore the pharmacological effects of NCTS on energy metabolism to protect against HF post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) via RXRα. We established a left anterior descending artery ligation-induced HF post-AMI model in mice and an oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion-induced H9c2 cell model to investigate the cardioprotective effect of NCTS. Component-target binding techniques, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), microscale thermophoresis (MST) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection were applied to explore the potential mechanism by which NCTS targets RXRα. The results showed that NCTS protects the heart against ischaemic damage, evidenced by improvement of cardiac dysfunction and attenuation of cellular hypoxic injury. Importantly, the SPR and MST results showed that NCTS has a high binding affinity for RXRα. Meanwhile, the critical downstream target genes of RXRα/PPARα, which are involved in fatty acid metabolism, including Cd36 and Cpt1a, were upregulated under NCTS treatment. Moreover, NCTS enhanced TFAM levels, promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and increased myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels by activating RXRα. In conclusion, we confirmed that NCTS improves myocardial energy metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, by regulating the RXRα/PPARα pathway in mice with HF post-AMI.","['Fatty acid oxidation', 'Heart failure', 'Mitochondrial biogenesis', 'Neocryptotanshinone', 'RXRα']",2023-03-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37200499,Uncovering Endoplasmic Reticulum Superoxide Regulating Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Dynamic Reversible Fluorescence Imaging.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a relatively common complication of liver resection and transplantation that is intimately connected to oxidative stress. The superoxide anion radical (O2•-), as the first reactive oxygen species produced by organisms, is an important marker of HIRI. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential site for O2•- production, especially ER oxidative stress, which is closely linked to HIRI. Thus, dynamic variations in ER O2•- may accurately indicate the HIRI extent. However, there is still a lack of tools for the dynamic reversible detection of ER O2•-. Therefore, we designed and prepared an ER-targeted fluorescent reversible probe DPC for real-time tracing of O2•- fluctuations. We successfully observed a marked increase in ER O2•- levels in HIRI mice. A potential NADPH oxidase 4-ER O2•--SERCA2b-caspase 4 signaling pathway in HIRI mice was also revealed. Attractively, DPC was successfully used for precise fluorescent navigation and excision of HIRI sites.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37199864,Mitoprotective effect of mesenchymal stem cells-derived conditioned medium in myocardial reperfusion injury of aged rats: role of SIRT-1/PGC-1α/NRF-2 network.,"The aged myocardium experiences various forms of stress that cause reduction of its tolerance to injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Developing effective cardioprotective modalities to prevent the amplification of I/R injury during aging is under focus of investigation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to regenerate infarcted myocardium mostly by producing multiple secretory factors. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of mitoprotection by MSCs-conditioned medium (CM) in myocardial I/R injury of aged rats.Male Wistar rats (n = 72, 400-450 g, 22-24 months old) were randomized into groups with/without I/R and/or MSCs-CM treatment. To establish myocardial I/R injury, the method of LAD occlusion and re-opening was employed. MSCs-CM was administered intramyocardially (150 μl) at the onset of reperfusion in recipient group. After 24 h reperfusion, myocardial infarct size, LDH level, mitochondrial functional endpoints, expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-associated genes, and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. After 28 days reperfusion, echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function was performed.MSCs-CM treatment improved myocardial function and decreased infarct size and LDH level in aged I/R rats (P < .05 to P < .001). It also decreased mitochondrial ROS formation, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, upregulated mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes including SIRT-1, PGC-1α, and NRF-2, and lessened TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels (P < .05 to P < .01).MSCs-CM treatment attenuated myocardial I/R injury in aged rats, in part by improving mitochondrial function and biogenesis and restraining inflammatory reaction. the upregulation of SIRT-1/PGC-1α/NRF-2 profiles is a possible target for the mitoprotective effects of MSCs-CM following I/R injury during aging.","['Aging', 'Cardioprotection', 'Conditioned medium', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Mitoprotection', 'Myocardial reperfusion injury']",2022-12-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37199734,Microglia Exhibit Distinct Heterogeneity Rather than M1/M2 Polarization within the Early Stage of Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"The classification of microglial M1/M2 polarization in the acute phase of ischemic stroke remains controversial, which has limited further advances in neuroprotective strategy. To thoroughly assess the microglial phenotypes, we made the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice to simulate the acute pathological processes of ischemic stroke from normal conditions to acute cerebral ischemia and then to the early reperfusion period. The temporal changes in gene profiles, cell subtypes, and microglial function were comprehensively analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 37,614 microglial cells and divided them into eight distinct subpopulations. Mic_home, Mic_pre1, and Mic_pre2 subpopulations were three clusters mainly composed of cells from the control samples, in which Mic_home was a homeostatic subpopulation characterized by high expression of Hpgd and Tagap, and Mic_pre1 and Mic_pre2 were two clusters with preliminary inflammatory activation characteristics marked by P2ry13 and Wsb1 respectively. Mic_M1L1 and Mic_M1L2 subpopulations exhibited M1-like polarization manifested by the upregulation of inflammatory genes after ischemic stroke, while the intrinsic heterogeneity on the level of inflammatory responses and neurotrophic support properties was observed. Moreover, we identified three unique clusters of cells with low inflammation levels. Mic_np1, Mic_np2, and Mic_np3 were characterized by high expression of Arhgap45, Rgs10, and Pkm respectively. However, these cells did not show significant M2-like characteristics and their classic microglia function was also attenuated. These subpopulations exhibited higher activation of neuropeptide functional pathways. At last, we performed cell-cell communication analysis and identified major couplings contributing to the interaction between microglia and other cell populations. In summary, our study elucidated the temporal heterogeneity of microglia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, which may facilitate the identification of effective neuroprotective targets to curb ischemic damage at an early stage.",[],2023-01-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37199660,FTO represses NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and alleviates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via inhibiting CBL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin.,"Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a complicated pathological event, which has close association with pyroptosis. This study uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis during cardiac I/R injury. H9c2 cells were stimulated with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Cell viability and pyroptosis were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. Western blotting or RT-qPCR was performed to analyze target molecule expression. NLRP3 and Caspase-1 expression was observed by immunofluorescence staining. IL-18 and IL-1β production was detected by ELISA. The total m6A and m6A level of CBL was determined by dot blot assay and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR, respectively. The interaction between IGF2BP3 and CBL mRNA was confirmed by RNA pull-down and RIP assays. The protein interaction between CBL and β-catenin and β-catenin ubiquitination were evaluated by Co-IP. Myocardial I/R model was established in rats. We determined infarct size by TTC staining and pathological changes by H&E staining. LDH, CK-MB, LVFS, and LVEF were also assessed. FTO and β-catenin were down-regulated, while CBL was up-regulated by OGD/R stimulation. FTO/β-catenin overexpression or CBL silencing restrained OGD/R-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. CBL repressed β-catenin expression via ubiquitination and degradation. FTO reduced the mRNA stability of CBL by inhibiting m6A modification. CBL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin were involved in FTO-induced pyroptosis inhibition during myocardial I/R injury. FTO inhibits NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis to attenuate myocardial I/R injury via repressing CBL-induced ubiquitination degradation of β-catenin.","['CBL', 'FTO', 'NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis', 'myocardial I/R injury', 'β-catenin']",2022-11-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37198377,Anti-inflammatory Therapy Progress in Major Adverse Cardiac Events after PCI: Chinese and Western Medicine.,"Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of death in cardiovascular disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an important method for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD), and it has greatly reduced the mortality of ACS patients since its application. However, a series of new problems may occur after PCI, such as in-stent restenosis, no-reflow phenomenon, in-stent neoatherosclerosis, late stent thrombosis, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias, which result in the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) that seriously reduce the postoperative benefit for patients. The inflammatory response is a key mechanism of MACE after PCI. Therefore, examining effective anti-inflammatory therapies after PCI in patients with ACS is a current research focus to reduce the incidence of MACE. The pharmacological mechanism and clinical efficacy of routine Western medicine treatment for the anti-inflammatory treatment of CHD have been verified. Many Chinese medicine (CM) preparations have been widely used in the treatment of CHD. Basic and clinical studies showed that effectiveness of the combination of CM and Western medicine treatments in reducing incidence of MACE after PCI was better than Western medicine treatment alone. The current paper reviewed the potential mechanism of the inflammatory response and occurrence of MACE after PCI in patients with ACS and the research progress of combined Chinese and Western medicine treatments in reducing incidence of MACE. The results provide a theoretical basis for further research and clinical treatment.","['Chinese medicine', 'anti-inflammatory therapy', 'inflammatory response', 'major adverse cardiac events', 'percutaneous coronary intervention']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37196812,Application of omics technology to investigate the mechanism underlying the role of San Hua Tang in regulating microglia polarization and blood-brain barrier protection following ischemic stroke.,"San Hua Tang (SHT) was first mentioned in the book ""The Collection of Plain Questions about Pathogenesis, Qi, and Life."" SHT has the effect of dispelling wind and dredging collaterals, dredging viscera, and guiding stagnation, and is used in the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS). SHT is composed of Rheum palmatum L., Magnolia officinalis Rehder & E.H.Wilson, Citrus assamensis S.Dutta & S.C.Bhattacharya, and Notopterygium tenuifolium M.L.Sheh & F.T.Pu, which is the traditional prescription of the Tongxia method for the treatment of stroke. Tongxia is one of the ""eight methods"" used in traditional Chinese medicine, which plays a role in treating diseases by promoting gastrointestinal peristalsis and defecation. Studies have demonstrated a close relationship between gut microbiota metabolism and cerebral stroke; however, the role of SHT in IS treatment through gut microbiota or intestinal metabolites is unclear.To explore the connotation of the Xuanfu theory and clarify the mechanism underlying SHT-mediated opening Xuanfu methods. Through metabolomics, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and molecular biology techniques, research on the changes in the gut microbiota and blood-brain barrier (BBB) will highlight greater strategies for the treatment of stroke.We used pseudo-germ-free (PGF) rats combined with an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat model for the follow-up experimental research. PGF rats were prepared by the intragastric administration of an antibiotic cocktail for 6 days, following which SHT was administered for 5 consecutive days. The I/R model was performed 1 day following the concluding administration of SHT. We detected the neurological deficit score, cerebral infarct volume, serum inflammatory factor levels (interleukin IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), tight junction-related proteins (Zonula occludens-1, Occludin, and Claudin-5), and small glue plasma cell-associated proteins (Cluster of Differentiation 16/Cluster of Differentiation 206, Matrix metalloproteinase, ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, and C-X3-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 1) 24 h following I/R. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, we explored the relationship between fecal microecology and serum metabolites. Eventually, we analyzed the correlation between the gut microbiota and plasma metabolic profile as well as the mechanism underlying the SHT-mediated regulation of gut microbiota to protect the BBB following stroke.In IS treatment, SHT is principally involved in reducing neurological injury and the volume of cerebral infarction; protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier; increasing the levels of acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid; promoting the transformation of microglia to the M2 state; reducing inflammatory reactions; and enhancing tight junctions. These therapeutic effects were not observed in the group treated with antibiotics alone or that treated with SHT in combination with antibiotics, thereby indicating SHT plays a therapeutic role through the gut microbiota.SHT regulates the gut microbiota, inhibits pro-inflammatory factors in rats with IS, alleviates an inflammatory injury of the BBB, and plays a protective role in the brain.","['16S rRNA', 'Blood-brain barrier', 'Inflammatory injury', 'Ischemic stroke', 'LCMS', 'Microglia', 'San Hua Tang']",2022-12-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37196676,Inhibiting membrane rupture with NINJ1 antibodies limits tissue injury.,"Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in dying cells undergoing pyroptosis or apoptosis requires the cell-surface protein NINJ11. PMR releases proinflammatory cytoplasmic molecules, collectively called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), that activate immune cells. Therefore, inhibiting NINJ1 and PMR may limit the inflammation that is associated with excessive cell death. Here we describe an anti-NINJ1 monoclonal antibody, specifically targeting murine NINJ1, that blocks oligomerization of NINJ1 and prevents PMR. By electron microscopy, this antibody prevented NINJ1 from forming oligomeric filaments. In mice, inhibition of NINJ1 or Ninj1 deficiency ameliorated hepatocellular PMR induced with TNF plus D-Galactosamine, concanavalin A, Jo2 anti-Fas agonist antibody, or ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Accordingly, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and DAMPs interleukin 18 (IL-18) and HMGB1 were reduced. Moreover, in the liver IRI model, there was an attendant reduction in neutrophil infiltration. These data indicate that NINJ1 mediates PMR and inflammation in diseases driven by aberrant hepatocellular death.",[],2022-11-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37196241,MicroRNA-204-5p Ameliorates Neurological Injury via the EphA4/PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway in Ischemic Stroke.,"Ischemic stroke has extremely high mortality and disability rates worldwide. miR-204-5p has been reported to be associated with neurological diseases. However, the relationship linking miR-204-5p to ischemic stroke and its molecular mechanism remain unclear. Herein, we found that expression of miR-204-5p was significantly decreased while EphA4 increased in vivo and vitro, which reached the peak at 24 h after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Then, we altered miR-204-5p expression in rats by cerebroventricular injection. Our study showed that miR-204-5p overexpression obviously reduced the brain infarction area and neurological score. We successfully cultured neurons to investigate the downstream mechanism. Upregulation of miR-204-5p increased cell viability and suppressed the release of LDH. Moreover, the proportion of apoptotic cells tested by TUNEL and flow cytometry and protein expression of Cleaved Caspase3 and Bax were inhibited. The relative expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β was repressed. In contrary, knockdown of miR-204-5p showed the opposite results. Bioinformatics and a dual luciferase assay illustrated that EphA4 was a target gene. Further research studies demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of miR-204-5p could be partially mitigated by upregulating EphA4. Next, we proved that the miR-204-5p/EphA4 axis furtherly activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. We thoroughly illustrated the role of neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, whether there are other mechanisms associated with the EphA4/PI3K/AKT pathway needs further investigation. Altogether, the miR-204-5p axis ameliorates neurological injury via the EphA4/PI3K/AKT pathway, which is expected to serve as an effective treatment for ischemic stroke.","['EphA4', 'PI3K/AKT', 'ischemic stroke', 'microRNA-204-5p', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal apoptosis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37196114,Normobaric Hyperoxia (NBHO): An Adjunctive Therapy to Cerebrovascular Recanalization in Ischemic Stroke.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a serious neurological disease. Normobaric hyperoxia (NBHO) is both a non-invasive and easy method that seems to be able to improve outcomes after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In clinical trials, normal low-flow oxygen has been shown to be ineffective, but NBHO has been shown to have a transient brain-protective effect. Today, NBHO combined with recanalization is the best treatment available. NBHO combined with thrombolysis is considered to improve neurological scores and long-term outcomes. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), however, are still needed to determine the role they will have in stroke treatment. RCTs of NBHO combined with thrombectomy have both improved infarct volume at 24 hours and the long-term prognosis. These two mechanisms most likely play key roles in the neuroprotective actions of NBHO after recanalization, including the increase in penumbra oxygen supply and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Considering the mechanism of action of NBHO, oxygen should be given as early as possible to increase the duration of oxygen therapy before recanalization is initiated. NBHO can further prolong the existence time of penumbra, so that more patients may benefit from it. Overall, however, recanalization therapy is still essential.",[],2022-11-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37195900,Neuroglobin protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats by suppressing mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis through synaptotagmin-1.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains a grievous health threat, and herein effective therapy is urgently needed. This study explored the protection of neuroglobin (Ngb) in rats with cerebral I/R injury. The focal cerebral I/R rat models were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and neuronal injury models were established by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment. The brain injury of rats was assessed. Levels of Ngb, Bcl-2, Bax, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related markers, and Syt1 were measured by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. The cytotoxicity in neurons was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Levels of intracellular Ca2+ and mitochondrial function-related indicators were determined. The binding between Ngb and Syt1 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. Ngb was upregulated in cerebral I/R rats and its overexpression alleviated brain injury. In OGD/R-induced neurons, Ngb overexpression decreased LDH level and neuronal apoptosis, decreased Ca2+ content, and mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS-related apoptosis. However, Ngb silencing imposed the opposite effects. Importantly, Ngb could bind to Syt1. Syt1 knockdown partially counteracted the alleviation of Ngb on OGD/R-induced injury in neurons and cerebral I/R injury in rats. Briefly, Ngb extenuated cerebral I/R injury by repressing mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis through Syt1.","['apoptosis', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'middle cerebral artery occlusion', 'mitochondria', 'neuroglobin', 'oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation', 'synaptotagmin-1']",2022-09-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37195793,Continued Infarction Growth and Penumbral Consumption After Reperfusion in Vaccine-Naïve Patients With COVID-19: A Case-Control Study.,"Background: Neurologic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 include potentially malignant cerebrovascular events arising from complex hemodynamic, hematologic, and inflammatory processes occurring in concert. Objective: This study concerns the hypothesis that, despite angiographic reperfusion, COVID-19 promotes continued consumption of at-risk tissue volumes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) unlike what is seen with COVID-negative individuals, yielding critical insights into prognostication and monitoring paradigms in vaccine-naïve patients experiencing AIS. Methods: This retrospective study compared 100 consecutively presenting patients with COVID-19 and AIS between March 2020 and April 2021 with a contemporaneous cohort of 282 patients with AIS who did not have COVID-19. Reperfusion classes were dichotomized into positive (extended thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia [eTICI] score = 2c-3) and negative (eTICI score < 2c) groups. All patients underwent endovascular therapy following initial CT perfusion imaging (CTP) to document infarction core and total hypoperfusion volumes. Results: Ten COVID-positive (mean age ± SD, 67 ± 6 years; seven men, three women) and 144 COVID-negative patients (mean age, 71 ± 10 years; 76 men, 68 women) undergoing endovascular reperfusion with antecedent CTP and follow-up imaging comprised the final dataset. Initial infarction core and total hypoperfusion volumes were 1.5 ± 18 mL and 85 ± 100 mL in COVID-negative patients and 30.5 ± 34 mL and 117 ± 80.5 mL in COVID-positive patients, respectively. Final infarction volumes were significantly larger in patients with COVID-19, with median volumes of 77.8 mL versus 18.2 mL among control patients (p = .01), as were normalized measures of infarction growth relative to baseline infarction volume (p = .05). In adjusted logistic parametric regression models, COVID positivity emerged as a significant predictor for continued infarct growth (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.0-25.95]; p = .05). Conclusion: These findings support the potentially aggressive clinical course of cerebrovascular events in patients with COVID-19, suggesting greater infarction growth and ongoing consumption of at-risk tissues, even following angiographic reperfusion. Clinical Impact: SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote continued infarction progression, despite angiographic reperfusion, in vaccine-naïve patients with large-vessel occlusion AIS. The findings carry potential implications for prognostication, treatment selection, and surveillance for infarction growth among revascularized patients in future waves of infection by novel viral strains.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Advances in nanomedicine enable alteration of pharmacokinetics and targeted treatments improving efficiency and reducing toxicity. This review addresses recent developments of nanocarriers used for various purposes in the broad field of kidney disease, which may pave a path to therapeutic and diagnostic solutions for kidney disease.Controlled delivery of antiproliferative medications enables improved treatment of polycystic kidney disease and fibrosis. Directed anti-inflammatory treatment mitigated glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Multiple injury pathways in AKI have been targeted, with therapeutic solutions for oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, local inflammation and improving self-repair mechanisms. In addition to such treatment development, noninvasive early detection methods (minutes after ischemic insult) have been demonstrated as well.

Our previous study found that LIPUS treatment could halt the chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in mice; unexpectedly, we observed the improvement of CKD-reduced muscle weights by LIPUS treatment. Here, we further tested the protective potential of LIPUS on CKD-associated muscle wasting/sarcopenia using the CKD mouse models. Mouse models of both unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) with nephrectomy and adenine administration were used to induce CKD. LIPUS with condition of 3 MHz, 100 mW/cm2, 20 min/day was applied to the kidney of CKD mice. LIPUS treatment significantly reversed the increased serum BUN/creatinine levels in CKD mice. LIPUS effectively prevented the decrease in grip strength, muscle weight (soleus, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles), cross-section areas of muscle fibres, and muscular phosphorylated Akt protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and the increase in muscular atrogenes Atrogin1 and MuRF1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in CKD mice. These results indicated that LIPUS could help improve weak muscle strength, muscle mass loss, muscle atrophy-related protein expression, and Akt inactivation.

Insufficient blood flow causes ovarian tissue hypoxia and leads to ischemia. This study aimed to investigate whether tocilizumab has a protective effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury due to ovarian torsion in rats. Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups (Sham (SG), ischemia-reperfusion (OIR), and ischemia-reperfusion+tocilizumab (OIRT)). Degeneration, necrosis, vascular dilatation/congestion, interstitial edema, hemorrhage, and polymorphonuclear lymphocyte (PMNL) infiltration scores were significantly different between the groups (p=0.001 for all parameters). Moreover, the OIRT group had a significant improvement in these criteria compared to the OIR group (p<0.05). Additionally, there was a considerable difference between OIRT and OIR groups in the number of primordial, developing, and atretic follicles groups (p<0.05), while there was no difference in the number of corpus luteum (p=0.052). Stress markers or cytokines, such as MDA, tGSH, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, were significantly different between groups (p<0.05). Furthermore, a significant improvement was found in the measured variables when the OIRT group was compared with the OIR group (p<0.05).

37194899,Ticagrelor Loading on ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction: Interaction With Prodromal Angina on Infarct Size and Clinical Events.,"Ticagrelor might reduce infarct size by exerting a more potent antiplatelet effect or by promoting a potential conditioning stimulus in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Pre-infarction angina (PIA) is an effective preconditioning stimulus that reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury. Because little is known on the interaction of PIA in STEMI-patients loaded with ticagrelor, we sought to determine if patients loaded with ticagrelor had improved clinical outcomes as compared to clopidogrel and to study if it is modulated by the presence of PIA.From 1272 STEMI patients submitted to primary percutaneous coronary intervention and treated with clopidogrel or ticagrelor from January 2008 to December 2018, 826 were analyzed after propensity score matching. Infarct size was estimated using peak creatine kinase (CK) and troponin T (TnT), and clinical impact was evaluated through cumulative major cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 1-year follow-up. Matched patients and their interaction with PIA were analyzed.Patients loaded with ticagrelor had lower peak CK [1405.50 U/L (730.25-2491.00), P < .001] and TnT [3.58 ng/mL (1.73-6.59), P < .001)], regardless of PIA. The presence of PIA was associated with lower CK (P = .030), but not TnT (P = .097). There was no interaction between ticagrelor loading and PIA (P = .788 for TnT and P = .555 for CK). There was no difference in MACCE incidence between clopidogrel or ticagrelor loading (P = .129). Cumulative survival was also similar between clopidogrel or ticagrelor, regardless of PIA (P = .103).Ticagrelor reduced infarct sizes independently and without a synergic effect with PIA. Despite reducing infarct size, clinical outcomes were similar across both groups.","['STEMI', 'cardioprotection', 'conditioning', 'pre-infarction angina', 'ticagrelor']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, the precise mechanisms involved in RIPC-induced cardioprotection are not fully explored. The present study was aimed to identify the role of melatonin in RIPC-induced late cardioprotective effects in rats and to explore the role of H2S, TNF-α and mitoKATP in melatonin-mediated effects in RIPC.Wistar rats were subjected to RIPC in which hind limb was subjected to four alternate cycles of ischemia and reperfusion of 5 min duration by using a neonatal blood pressure cuff. After 24 h of RIPC or ramelteon-induced pharmacological preconditioning, hearts were isolated and subjected to IR injury on the Langendorff apparatus.RIPC and ramelteon preconditioning protected the hearts from IR injury and it was assessed by a decrease in LDH-1, cTnT and increase in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP). RIPC increased the melatonin levels (in plasma), H2S (in heart) and decreased TNF-α levels. The effects of RIPC were abolished in the presence of melatonin receptor blocker (luzindole), ganglionic blocker (hexamethonium) and mitochondrial KATP blocker (5-hydroxydecanoic acid).RIPC produce delayed cardioprotection against IR injury through the activation of neuronal pathway, which may increase the plasma melatonin levels to activate the cardioprotective signaling pathway involving the opening of mitochondrial KATP channels, decrease in TNF-α production and increase in H2S levels. Ramelteon-induced pharmacological preconditioning may also activate the cardioprotective signaling pathway involving the opening of mitochondrial KATP channels, decrease in TNF-α production and increase in H2S levels.",[],2022-10-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Then, the effects of CaD H2O2-damaged HK-2 cells were investigated, as reflected by the results of cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, apoptosis and markers of kidney injury.The results showed that CaD treatment effectively attenuated the renal functions, pathological changes, and oxidative stress in I/R-induced AKI mice. It effectively reduced ROS production and improved MMP and apoptosis in H2O2-damaged HK-2 cells. The increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins and kidney injury biomarkers were significantly ameliorated after CaD treatment.Overall, CaD effectively ameliorated renal injury by eliminating ROS and demonstrated in vivo and in vitro for I/R-induced AKI. CaD has been shown to be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of I/R-induced AKI.","['acute kidney injury', 'apoptosis', 'calcium dobesilate', 'ischemia reperfusion', 'oxidative stress']",2022-09-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37194066,SDMA attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis through inhibition of STAT4.,"Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is the hallmark of various chronic kidney diseases. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney diseases, which is mostly excreted through renal tubules. However, the effect of SDMA on kidneys in a pathological condition is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of SDMA in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and explored its underlying mechanisms.Mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI) models were established to study renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. SDMA was injected into kidneys through ureter retrogradely. TGF-β stimulated human renal epithelial (HK2) cells were used as an in vitro model and treated with SDMA. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 (STAT4) was inhibited by berbamine dihydrochloride or siRNA or overexpressed by plasmids in vitro. Masson staining and Western blotting were performed to evaluate renal fibrosis. Quantitative PCR was performed to validate findings derived from RNA sequencing analysis.We observed that SDMA (from 0.01 to 10 µM) dose-dependently inhibited the expression of pro-fibrotic markers in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells. Intrarenal administration of SDMA (2.5 µmol/kg or 25 µmol/kg) dose-dependently attenuated renal fibrosis in UUO kidneys. A significant increase in SDMA concentration (from 19.5 to 117.7 nmol/g, p < 0.001) in mouse kidneys was observed after renal injection which was assessed by LC-MS/MS. We further showed that intrarenal administration of SDMA attenuated renal fibrosis in UIRI induced mouse fibrotic kidneys. Through RNA sequencing analysis, we found that the expression of STAT4 was reduced by SDMA in UUO kidneys, which was further confirmed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis in mouse fibrotic kidneys and renal cells. Inhibition of STAT4 by berbamine dihydrochloride (0.3 mg/ml or 3.3 mg/ml) or siRNA reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic markers in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells. Furthermore, blockage of STAT4 attenuated the anti-fibrotic effect of SDMA in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells. Conversely, overexpression of STAT4 reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of SDMA in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells.Taken together, our study indicates that renal SDMA ameliorates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis through inhibition of STAT4.","['Renal fibrosis', 'SDMA', 'STAT4']",2022-11-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37193033,m6A eraser ALKBH5 mitigates the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in ischemia reperfusion injury through m6A/SIRT1 axis.,"Recent studies have shown that the potential regulatory role of N6-methyladenine (m6A) modification may affect the occurrence and development of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the regulatory mechanism of m6A modification on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) is rarely reported. A mouse model of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) was established by ligation and perfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and a cellular model of hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) was conducted in cardiomyocytes (CMs). We found that the protein expression of ALKBH5 in myocardial tissues and cells were decreased, accompanied by increased m6A modification level. Overexpression of ALKBH5 significantly inhibited H/R-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in CMs. Mechanistically, there was an enriched m6A motif in the 3'-UTR of SIRT1 genome, and ALKBH5 overexpression promoted the stability of SIRT1 mRNA. Furthermore, results using overexpression or knockdown of SIRT1 confirmed the protective effect of SIRT1 on H/R induced CMs apoptosis. Together, our study reveals a critical role of ALKBH5-medicated m6A on CM apoptosis, supplying an important regulating effect of m6A methylation in ischemic heart disease.","['ALKBH5', 'Cardiomyocytes']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37192200,Traumatic Transradial Forearm Amputation Temporized With Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Brief Report.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is typically used to provide mechanical perfusion and gas exchange to critically ill patients with cardiopulmonary failure. We present a case of a traumatic high transradial amputation in which the amputated limb was placed on ECMO to allow for limb perfusion during bony fixation and preparations and coordination of orthopedic and vascular soft tissue reconstructions.This is a descriptive single case report which underwent managment at a level 1 trauma center. Instutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained.This case highlights many important factors of limb salvage. First, complex limb salvage requires a well-organized, pre-planned multi-disciplinary approach to optimize patient outcomes. Second, advancements in trauma resuscitation and reconstructive techniques over the past 20 years have drastically expanded the ability of treating surgeons to preserve limbs that would have otherwise been indicated for amputation. Lastly, which will be the focus of further discussion, ECMO and EP have a role in the limb salvage algorithm to extend current timing limitations for ischemia, allow for multidisciplinary planning, and prevent reperfusion injury with increasing literature to support its use.ECMO is an emerging technology that may have clinical utility for traumatic amputations, limb salvage, and free flap cases. In particular, it may extend current limitations of ischemia time and reduce the incidence of ischemia reperfusion injury in proximal amputation, thus expanding the current indications for proximal limb replantation. It is clear that developing a multi-disciplinary limb salvage team with standardized treatment protocols is paramount to optimize patient outcomes and allows limb salvage to be pursued in increasingly complex cases.",[],2023-02-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37191968,TFAP2C inhibits cell autophagy to alleviate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating miR-23a-5p/SFRP5/Wnt5a axis.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury contributes to severe injury for cardiomyocytes. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of TFAP2C on cell autophagy in MI/R injury. MTT assay measured cell viability. The cells injury was evaluated by commercial kits. IF detected the level of LC3B. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay, ChIP or RIP assay were performed to verify the interactions between crucial molecules. We found that TFAP2C and SFRP5 expression were decreased while miR-23a-5p and Wnt5a increased in AC16 cells in response to H/R condition. H/R induction led to cell injury and induced autophagy, which were reversed by TFAP2C overexpression or 3-MA treatment (an autophagy inhibitor). Mechanistically, TFAP2C suppressed miR-23a expression through binding to miR-23a promoter, and SFRP5 was a target gene of miR-23a-5p. Moreover, miR-23a-5p overexpression or rapamycin reversed the protective impacts of TFAP2C overexpression on cells injury and autophagy upon H/R condition. In conclusion, TFAP2C inhibited autophagy to improve H/R-induced cells injury by mediating miR-23a-5p/SFRP5/Wnt5a axis.","['SFRP5', 'TFAP2C', 'autophagy', 'miR-23a-5p', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury']",2022-11-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37191727,USP22 knockdown protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via destabilizing PTEN protein and activating the mTOR/TFEB pathway.,"Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) expression was reported to be increased in response to ischemic brain damage, but the biological role and underlying mechanism remain little understood. USP22 shRNA was intravenously injected into the mouse brain, and then a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model was constructed, and the infarct volume, neurobehavioral deficit score, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy in vivo were evaluated. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) treated pheochromocytoma-12 (PC12) cells were used as an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion. The effects of USP22 on proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy were explored by CCK-8, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blot assays. The relationship between USP22 and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was measured by Co-IP and Western blot assays. Both USP22 and PTEN were highly expressed in MCAO/R mouse brain tissues and OGD/R-induced PC12 cells. In vitro, USP22 knockdown strongly improved OGD/R-mediated changes in cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production in PC12 cells. USP22 bound to PTEN and stabilized PTEN expression by decreasing its ubiquitination. PTEN overexpression reversed the promoting effect of USP22 knockdown on cell viability and the inhibitory effects of USP22 knockdown on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and LDH release rate in PC12 cells subjected to OGD/R. PTEN silencing elevated the protein levels of p62, p-mTOR, TFEB, and LAMP1 and reduced the protein levels of LC3-II/LC3-I. USP22 expression levels were negatively correlated with mTOR expression levels, and USP22-shRNA-mediated expression of p62, p-mTOR, TFEB, and LAMP1 was reversed by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. In vivo, USP22 silencing significantly alleviated infarct volume, neurobehavioral impairments, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy in MCAO/R mice. USP22 knockdown exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by downregulating PTEN and activating the mTOR/TFEB pathway.","['Ischemia/reperfusion', 'PTEN', 'USP22', 'mTOR']",2022-12-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37190856,Short-term toll-like receptor 9 inhibition leads to left ventricular wall thinning after myocardial infarction.,"Ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) following myocardial infarction remains a challenging topic in acute cardiac care and consecutively arising heart failure represents a severe long-term consequence. The extent of neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil-mediated cellular damage are thought to be aggravating factors enhancing primary tissue injury. Toll-like receptor 9 was found to be involved in neutrophil activation as well as chemotaxis and may represent a target in modulating IRI, aspects we aimed to illuminate by pharmacological inhibition of the receptor.Forty-nine male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were used. IRI was induced by occlusion of the left coronary artery and subsequent snare removal after 30 min. Oligonucleotide (ODN) 2088, a toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) antagonist, control-ODN, or DNase, were administered at the time of reperfusion and over 24 h via a mini-osmotic pump. The hearts were harvested 24 h or 4 weeks after left coronary artery occlusion and immunohistochemical staining was performed. Echocardiography was done after 1 and 4 weeks to determine ventricular function. Inhibition of TLR9 by ODN 2088 led to left ventricular wall thinning (P = 0.003) in association with drastically enhanced neutrophil infiltration (P = 0.005) and increased markers of tissue damage. Additionally, an up-regulation of the chemotactic receptor CXCR2 (P = 0.046) was found after TLR9 inhibition. No such effects were observed in control-ODN or DNase-treated animals. We did not observe changes in monocyte content or subset distribution, hinting towards neutrophils as the primary mediators of the exerted tissue injury.Our data indicate a TLR9-dependent, negative regulation of neutrophil infiltration. Blockage of TLR9 appears to prevent the down-regulation of CXCR2, followed by an uncontrolled migration of neutrophils towards the area of infarction and the exertion of disproportional tissue injury resulting in potential aneurysm formation. In comparison with previous studies conducted in TLR-/- mice, we deliberately chose a transient pharmacological inhibition of TLR9 to highlight effects occurring in the first 24 h following IRI.","['CXCR2', 'Infarction', 'Ischaemia-reperfusion', 'Neutrophils', 'TLR9']",2022-12-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37190785,Recent progress in the development of fluorescent probes for imaging pathological oxidative stress.,"Oxidative stress is closely related to the physiopathology of numerous diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive sulfur species (RSS) are direct participants and important biomarkers of oxidative stress. A comprehensive understanding of their changes can help us evaluate disease pathogenesis and progression and facilitate early diagnosis and drug development. In recent years, fluorescent probes have been developed for real-time monitoring of ROS, RNS and RSS levels in vitro and in vivo. In this review, conventional design strategies of fluorescent probes for ROS, RNS, and RSS detection are discussed from three aspects: fluorophores, linkers, and recognition groups. We introduce representative fluorescent probes for ROS, RNS, and RSS detection in cells, physiological/pathological processes (e.g., Inflammation, Drug Induced Organ Injury and Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury etc.), and specific diseases (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, depression, diabetes and cancer, etc.). We then highlight the achievements, current challenges, and prospects for fluorescent probes in the pathophysiology of oxidative stress-related diseases.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37189811,Age-Dependent Changes in Calcium Regulation after Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"During aging, heart structure and function gradually deteriorate, which subsequently increases susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion (IR). Maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis is critical for cardiac contractility. We used Langendorff's model to monitor the susceptibility of aging (6-, 15-, and 24-month-old) hearts to IR, with a specific focus on Ca2+-handling proteins. IR, but not aging itself, triggered left ventricular changes when the maximum rate of pressure development decreased in 24-month-olds, and the maximum rate of relaxation was most affected in 6-month-old hearts. Aging caused a deprivation of Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, and ryanodine receptor contents. IR-induced damage to ryanodine receptor stimulates Ca2+ leakage in 6-month-old hearts and elevated phospholamban (PLN)-to-SERCA2a ratio can slow down Ca2+ reuptake seen at 2-5 μM Ca2+. Total and monomeric PLN mirrored the response of overexpressed SERCA2a after IR in 24-month-old hearts, resulting in stable Ca2+-ATPase activity. Upregulated PLN accelerated inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity at low free Ca2+ in 15-month-old after IR, and reduced SERCA2a content subsequently impairs the Ca2+-sequestering capacity. In conclusion, our study suggests that aging is associated with a significant decrease in the abundance and function of Ca2+-handling proteins. However, the IR-induced damage was not increased during aging.","['Ca2+-ATPase', 'aging', 'calcium handling', 'heart', 'ischemia', 'reperfusion']",2023-03-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37189692,Light Alcohol Consumption Promotes Early Neurogenesis Following Ischemic Stroke in Adult C57BL/6J Mice.,"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Neurogenesis plays a crucial role in postischemic functional recovery. Alcohol dose-dependently affects the prognosis of ischemic stroke. We investigated the impact of light alcohol consumption (LAC) on neurogenesis under physiological conditions and following ischemic stroke. C57BL/6J mice (three months old) were fed with 0.7 g/kg/day ethanol (designed as LAC) or volume-matched water (designed as control) daily for eight weeks. To evaluate neurogenesis, the numbers of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+/doublecortin (DCX)+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ neurons were assessed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), dentate gyrus (DG), ischemic cortex, and ischemic striatum. The locomotor activity was determined by the accelerating rotarod and open field tests. LAC significantly increased BrdU+/DCX+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the SVZ under physiological conditions. Ischemic stroke dramatically increased BrdU+/DCX+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the DG, SVZ, ischemic cortex, and ischemic striatum. The increase in BrdU+/DCX+ cells was significantly greater in LAC mice compared to the control mice. In addition, LAC significantly increased BrdU+/NeuN+ cells by about three folds in the DG, SVZ, and ischemic cortex. Furthermore, LAC reduced ischemic brain damage and improved locomotor activity. Therefore, LAC may protect the brain against ischemic stroke by promoting neurogenesis.","['alcohol', 'brain', 'dentate gyrus', 'ischemia', 'mice', 'neurogenesis', 'open field test', 'reperfusion', 'rotarod test', 'subventricular zone']",2023-02-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37189663,Endothelial Function and Hypoxic-Hyperoxic Preconditioning in Coronary Surgery with a Cardiopulmonary Bypass: Randomized Clinical Trial.,"A hypoxic-hyperoxic preconditioning (HHP) may be associated with cardioprotection by reducing endothelial damage and a beneficial effect on postoperative outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients (n = 120) were randomly assigned to an HHP and a control group. A safe, inhaled oxygen fraction for the hypoxic preconditioning phase (10-14% oxygen for 10 min) was determined by measuring the anaerobic threshold. At the hyperoxic phase, a 75-80% oxygen fraction was used for 30 min. The cumulative frequency of postoperative complications was 14 (23.3%) in the HHP vs. 23 (41.1%), p = 0.041. The nitrate decreased after surgery by up to 20% in the HHP group and up to 38% in the control group. Endothelin-1 and nitric oxide metabolites were stable in HHP but remained low for more than 24 h in the control group. The endothelial damage markers appeared to be predictors of postoperative complications. The HHP with individual parameters based on the anaerobic threshold is a safe procedure, and it can reduce the frequency of postoperative complications. The endothelial damage markers appeared to be predictors of postoperative complications.","['cardioprotection', 'cardiopulmonary bypass', 'endothelial damage markers', 'hypoxic–hyperoxic preconditioning', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'oxygen transport']",2023-02-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37189459,Downregulation of Bmal1 Expression in Celiac Ganglia Protects against Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) significantly contributes to liver dysfunction following liver transplantation and hepatectomy. However, the role of the celiac ganglion (CG) in HIRI remains unclear. Adeno-associated virus was used to silence Bmal1 expression in the CG of twelve beagles that were randomly assigned to the Bmal1 knockdown group (KO-Bmal1) and the control group. After four weeks, a canine HIRI model was established, and CG, liver tissue, and serum samples were collected for analysis. The virus significantly downregulated Bmal1 expression in the CG. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed a lower proportion of c-fos+ and NGF+ neurons in TH+ cells in the KO-Bmal1 group than in the control group. The KO-Bmal1 group exhibited lower Suzuki scores and serum ALT and AST levels than the control group. Bmal1 knockdown significantly reduced liver fat reserve, hepatocyte apoptosis, and liver fibrosis, and it increased liver glycogen accumulation. We also observed that Bmal1 downregulation inhibited the hepatic neurotransmitter norepinephrine, neuropeptide Y levels, and sympathetic nerve activity in HIRI. Finally, we confirmed that decreased Bmal1 expression in CG reduces TNF-α, IL-1β, and MDA levels and increases GSH levels in the liver. The downregulation of Bmal1 expression in CG suppresses neural activity and improves hepatocyte injury in the beagle model after HIRI.","['Bmal1', 'celiac ganglion', 'hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury']",2023-03-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37188495,"A Point Mutation at C151 of Keap1 of Mice Abrogates NRF2 Signaling, Cytoprotection In Vitro and Hepatoprotection In Vivo by Bardoxolone Methyl (CDDO-Me).","Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me) is an oleanane triterpenoid in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of patients with diabetic kidney disease. Preclinical studies in rodents demonstrate the efficacy of triterpenoids against carcinogenesis and other diseases including renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and immune hepatitis. Genetic disruption of NRF2 abrogates protection by triterpenoids, suggesting that induction of the NRF2 pathway may drive this protection. Herein, we examined the effect of a point mutation (C151S) in KEAP1, a repressor of NRF2 signaling, at cysteine 151 in mouse embryo fibroblasts and mouse liver. Induction of target gene transcripts and enzyme activity by CDDO-Me was lost in C151S mutant fibroblasts compared to wild-type. Protection against menadione toxicity was also nullified in the mutant fibroblasts. In mouse liver, CDDO-Me evoked the nuclear translocation of NRF2 followed by increased transcript and activity levels of a prototypic target gene Nqo1 in wild-type, but not C151S mutant mice. To test the role of KEAP1 Cys151 in governing the broader pharmacodynamic action of CDDO-Me, wild-type and C151S mutant mice were challenged with concanavalin A to induce immune hepatitis. Strong protection was seen in wild-type but not C151S mutant mice. RNA-seq analysis of mouse liver from wild-type, C151S mutant and Nrf2-knockout mice revealed a vigorous response of the Nrf2 transcriptome in wild-type, but in neither C151S mutant nor Nrf2-knockout mice. Activation of ""off-target"" pathways by CDDO were not observed. These data highlight the singular importance of the KEAP1 cysteine 151 sensor for activation of NRF2 signaling by CDDO-Me. Significance Statement Keap1 serves as a key sensor for induction of the cytoprotective signaling pathway driven by the transcription factor NRF2. Mutation of a single cysteine (C151) in KEAP1 abrogates the induction of NRF2 signaling and its downstream cytoprotective actions in vitro and in vivo by bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), a drug in late-stage clinical development. Further, at these bioeffective concentrations/doses, activation of ""off-target"" pathways by CDDO-Me are not observed, highlighting the singular importance of NRF2 in its mode of action.","['Liver', 'NADPH-quinone oxidoreductase', 'Nrf2', 'Regulation of gene expression', 'enzyme induction', 'expression profiling', 'signalling pathways', 'transgenic mice']",2023-01-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Oxygen and glucose deprivation model was set to validate the hub gene and explore the detailed brain injury mechanism.Interleukin, immunological response, NF-κB signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and NLRP inflammatory are functional pathway were enriched in differentially expressed genes analysis. Sucnr1, Casr, Cxcr4, C5ar1, Tas2r41, Tas2r60 and Hcar2 were identified and verified in the OGD model. Knocking down GPR91 reduces the inflammatory response after OGD and GPR91 may be involved in the inflammatory pre-reaction through the synergistic activation of NF-κB, NLRP3, and IL-1β respectively.Our study found that Interleukin, immunological response, NF-κB signaling pathway, G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and NLRP inflammatory are all associated with brain ischemia and reperfusion injury after deep hypothermic low flow and GPR91 can activate NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway and trigger the release of IL-1β in this progress.","['Brain injury', 'Brain ischemia and reperfusion', 'DHCA', 'GPR91', 'Inflammation', 'NF-κB', 'NLRP3']",2022-06-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37187091,Acrolein produced during acute kidney injury promotes tubular cell death.,"Acute kidney injury is an important global health concern as it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Polyamines, essential for cell growth and proliferation, are known to inhibit cardiovascular disease. However, under conditions of cellular damage, toxic acrolein is produced from polyamines by the enzyme spermine oxidase (SMOX). We used a mouse renal ischemia-reperfusion model and human proximal tubule cells (HK-2) to investigate whether acrolein exacerbates acute kidney injury by renal tubular cell death. Acrolein visualized by acroleinRED was increased in ischemia-reperfusion kidneys, particularly in tubular cells. When HK-2 cells were cultured under 1% oxygen for 24 h, then switched to 21% oxygen for 24 h (hypoxia-reoxygenation), acrolein accumulated and SMOX mRNA and protein levels were increased. Acrolein induced cell death and fibrosis-related TGFB1 mRNA in HK-2 cells. Administration of the acrolein scavenger cysteamine suppressed the acrolein-induced upregulation of TGFB1 mRNA. Cysteamine also inhibited a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential observed by MitoTrackerCMXRos, and cell death induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of SMOX also suppressed hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced acrolein accumulation and cell death. Our study suggests that acrolein exacerbates acute kidney injury by promoting tubular cell death during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Treatment to control the accumulation of acrolein might be an effective therapeutic option for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.","['Acrolein', 'Acute kidney injury', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Polyamine', 'Renal tubular cell', 'Spermine oxidase']",2023-04-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37186301,Dexmedetomidine alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via inhibiting autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.,"Dexmedetomidine has been shown to protect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism is obscure. In order to explore the effect of dexmedetomidine pre-conditioning on autophagy against CIRI in rats, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was conducted to establish cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model in male SD rats with 2 h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. Dexmedetomidine was delivered to rats at 10, 50 and 100 µg/kg doses respectively, and LY294002, a PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitor, was administered at 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally 30 min before MCAO. Neurological deficit score was assessed and cerebral infarct size was detected by TTC staining. Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to estimate spatial learning and memory ability. Furthermore, to detect activity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and autophagy, p-Akt, p-mTOR, Beclin-1 and LC3 were measured by western blot. Our findings revealed that 50 and 100 µg/kg of dexmedetomidine pretreatment could improve the neurological deficit score and reduce cerebral infarct size after CIRI, while these effects were markedly suppressed by LY294002. In MWM test, dexmedetomidine was confirmed to shorten escape latency and increase times across platform after CIRI. Nevertheless, LY294002 pretreatment eliminated the improvement of dexmedetomidine on spatial learning and memory ability. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine pretreatment reduced ratios of Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I and elevated p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR after CIRI. However, above effects of dexmedetomidine were partly reversed by LY294002. Overall, dexmedetomidine pretreatment exerted neuroprotection against CIRI in rats by attenuating autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.","['Autophagy', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Neuroprotection', 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway']",2022-05-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Evaluated the effects of BAP on ischaemic brain injury, on promoting neurogenesis, on inhibiting Inflammatory microenvironment and TLR4/MyD88/NFκB signalling pathway. A microglia oxygen-glucose deprivation reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was established that evaluated the effects of BAP on regulating the polarization of microglia and inflammatory microenvironment.BAP can inhibit the expression of TLR4, MyD88 and NFκB proteins, reduce IL-1β and increase IL-10, reduce M1 type microglia and increase M2 microglia. The proliferation of neural stem cells increased, synaptic gap decreased, synaptic interface curvature increased, expression of SYN and PSD95 proteins increased, which improved the neurological dysfunction and reduced the volume of cerebellar infarction and nerve cell injury.BAP can reduce CI/R injury and promote neurogenesis, the effect is related to inhibition of the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NFκB, regulating the polarization of microglia from M1 type to M2 type and inhibition of inflammatory response.","['NFκB', 'borneol combined with AST Ⅳ and PNS', 'cerebral ischaemia–reperfusion', 'inflammatory microenvironment', 'microglia polarization', 'neurogenesis']",2022-10-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Of note, men are more susceptive to AKI, suggesting gender differences in AKI patients. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. To test it, we adopted two experimental models of AKI, including ischemia/reperfusion injury and rhabdomyolysis, which were constructed in age-matched male and female mice. We found severe damages of tubular apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and loss of renal function showing in male mice, while female mice only had very mild injury. We further tested the expression of Sirtuins, and found that female mice could preserve more Sirtuin members' expression in case of kidney damage. Among Sirtuin family, Sirtuin 6 was maximally preserved in injured kidney in female mice, suggesting its important role involved in the gender differences of AKI pathogenesis. We then found that knockdown of androgen receptor (AR) attenuated tubular damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and retarded the loss of renal function. Overexpression of Sirtuin 6 also showed similar results. Furthermore, in cultured tubular cells, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreased Sirtuin 6 expression and exacerbated cell apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Sirtuin 6 sufficiently inhibited DHT-induced cell apoptosis. Mechanically, we found AR inhibited Sirtuin 6, leading to the repression of binding of Sirtuin 6 with PGC-1α. This resulted in acetylation of PGC-1α and inhibition of its activity, further triggered the loss of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our results provided new insights to the underlying mechanisms of gender differences in AKI, suggesting Sirtuin 6 maybe a new therapeutic target for preventing AKI in male patients.",[],2023-01-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37184476,Mitochondrial miR-23b-5p is a new biomarker of warm ischemic injury in donor livers and a candidate for graft evaluation: experimental studies.,"Warm ischemic injury (WII) stems from incorrect energy metabolism and is the main cause of graft dysfunction. Mitochondria, as the center of cellular metabolic activities, may be the key in identifying accurate indicators for evaluating the quality of grafts. Our research focuses on the screening, clinical application, and mechanism of the optimal WII mitochondrion biomarker.Using a 100% hepatic warm ischemia mouse model, without reperfusion, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated evident morphological changes of hepatic mitochondria at 15 min of ischemia. However, all 13 mt-mRNAs could not display continuously up-regulated consistency at 0-15-30-60 min during WII. High throughput analysis of miRNA expression in both purified mitochondria and liver tissues suggested miR-23b-5p was a potential mitochondrial microRNA (mitomiR) biomarker with high sensitivity and 0-15-30-60 min change consistency. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and RT-qPCR further confirmed the results. Through overexpression and inhibition, the functionality of this mitomiR during WII was identified as a protective regulator in vitro and then verified in Dicer1fl/flAlbCre mice by down-regulation of other miRNAs and supplementation of mature mitomiR-23b-5p. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and the Seahorse XF analyzer determined that mitomiR-23b-5p reduced mitochondrial respiratory function by silencing mtRNR2 (16S). Clinically, mitomiR-23b-5p was positively correlated with serum ALT levels 3 days after the operation (P=0.032), and the C-statistic for 90-day graft survival rate was 0.698.MitomiR-23b-5p plays a protective regulatory role and implements a special mitochondrial regulation mechanism not yet reported in WII. Our clinical results further support the experimental result that the expression of MitomiR-23b-5p is closely related to the prognosis of clinical liver transplantation patients. This is a promising new biomarker for WII evaluation of donor livers.",[],2022-11-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37184360,Cardiomyocyte tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis regulates fatty acid metabolism and susceptibility to ischaemia-reperfusion injury.,"What is the central question of this study? What are the physiological roles of cardiomyocyte-derived tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) in cardiac metabolism and stress response? What is the main finding and its importance? Cardiomyocyte BH4 has a physiological role in cardiac metabolism. There was a shift of substrate preference from fatty acid to glucose in hearts with targeted deletion of BH4 synthesis. The changes in fatty-acid metabolic profile were associated with a protective effect in response to ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, and reduced infarct size. Manipulating fatty acid metabolism via BH4 availability could play a therapeutic role in limiting IR injury.Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for nitric oxide (NO) synthases in which its production of NO is crucial for cardiac function. However, non-canonical roles of BH4 have been discovered recently and the cell-specific role of cardiomyocyte BH4 in cardiac function and metabolism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we developed a novel mouse model of cardiomyocyte BH4 deficiency, by cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Gch1, which encodes guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I, a required enzyme for de novo BH4 synthesis. Cardiomyocyte (cm)Gch1 mRNA expression and BH4 levels from cmGch1 KO mice were significantly reduced compared to Gch1flox/flox (WT) littermates. Transcriptomic analyses and protein assays revealed downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in cmGch1 KO hearts compared with WT, accompanied by increased triacylglycerol concentration within the myocardium. Deletion of cardiomyocyte BH4 did not alter basal cardiac function. However, the recovery of left ventricle function was improved in cmGch1 KO hearts when subjected to ex vivo ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, with reduced infarct size compared to WT hearts. Metabolomic analyses of cardiac tissue after IR revealed that long-chain fatty acids were increased in cmGch1 KO hearts compared to WT, whereas at 5 min reperfusion (post-35 min ischaemia) fatty acid metabolite levels were higher in WT compared to cmGch1 KO hearts. These results indicate a new role for BH4 in cardiomyocyte fatty acid metabolism, such that reduction of cardiomyocyte BH4 confers a protective effect in response to cardiac IR injury. Manipulating cardiac metabolism via BH4 could play a therapeutic role in limiting IR injury.","['cardiac metabolism', 'ischaemia-reperfusion injury', 'tetrahydrobiopterin']",2022-09-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37183617,The effect of an adaptation to hypoxia on cardiac tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion.,"The acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden cardiac death (SCD), both associated with acute cardiac ischemia, are one of the leading causes of adult death in economically developed countries. The development of new approaches for the treatment and prevention of AMI and SCD remains the highest priority for medicine. A study on the cardiovascular effects of chronic hypoxia (CH) may contribute to the development of these methods. Chronic hypoxia exerts both positive and adverse effects. The positive effects are the infarct-reducing, vasoprotective, and antiarrhythmic effects, which can lead to the improvement of cardiac contractility in reperfusion. The adverse effects are pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. This review presents a comprehensive overview of how CH enhances cardiac tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion. It is an in-depth analysis of the published data on the underlying mechanisms, which can lead to future development of the cardioprotective effect of CH. A better understanding of the CH-activated protective signaling pathways may contribute to new therapeutic approaches in an increase of cardiac tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion.","['arrhythmias', 'chronic hypoxia', 'heart', 'infarct size', 'vessels']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37183516,Gallic acid treatment protects intestinal tissue against ischemia-reperfusion.,"This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of gallic acid (GA) in the rat intestine against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury.Thirty male Wistar albino rats with a mean weight of 200-250 g were used. Animals were categorized into the sham, IR, and IR+GA groups. Ischemia of the intestine was induced for 3 h by occluding the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and then left for 3 h of reperfusion. In the IR+GA group, after ischemia induction, 50 mg/kg GA was orally administered to the animals. Blood samples were collected for biochemical assays. Intestinal tissues were excised for histopathologic and immunohistochemical processing.Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were increased, and catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) levels were decreased in the IR group compared to the sham group. After GA treatment, MDA levels decreased and CAT and GSH levels increased in the GA-treated group compared to the IR group. In the sham group, normal intestinal histology was observed. In the IR group, the villi structures were completely degenerated. In the IR+GA group, histology was improved after GA treatment. In the sham group, the Caspase-3 reaction was generally negative in the epithelium and glands. In the IR group, the Caspase-3 reaction increased in apoptotic bodies and inflammatory cells. The Caspase-3 reaction was negative in goblet cells and the epithelium. A moderate Caspase-3 reaction was observed in the IR+GA group. The Beclin-1 reaction was negative in epithelial cells and goblet cells in villi in the sham group. In the IR group, the Beclin-1 reaction was positive in the degenerated villi. An intense Beclin-1 reaction was also observed in some inflammatory cells. After GA treatment, the Beclin-1 reaction was positive in a few cells. In general, moderate Beclin-1 positivity was observed.GA, with its antioxidative effect, inhibited the apoptotic pathway (Caspase-3) through Beclin-1 regulation.","['Beclin-1', 'Caspase-3', 'gallic acid', 'ischemia-reperfusion']",2023-01-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37183341,Efficacy and safety of remote ischemic conditioning for acute ischemic stroke: A comprehensive meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials.,"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a remote, transient, and noninvasive procedure providing temporary ischemia and reperfusion. However, there is no comprehensive literature investigating the efficacy and safety of RIC for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the available studies.MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library database (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched before Sep 7, 2022. The data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4.1 software, Stata version 16.0 software, and R 4.2.0 software. Odds ratio (OR), mean difference (MD), and corresponding 95% CIs were pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis.We pooled 6392 patients from 17 randomized controlled trials. Chronic RIC could reduce the recurrence of ischemic stroke at the endpoints (OR 0.67, 95% CI [0.51, 0.87]). RIC could also improve the prognosis of patients at 90 days as assessed by mRS score (mRS 0-1: OR 1.29, 95% CI [1.09, 1.52]; mRS 0-2: OR 1.22, 95% CI [1.01, 1.48]) and at the endpoints assessed by NIHSS score (MD -0.99, 95% CI [-1.45, -0.53]). RIC would not cause additional adverse events such as death (p = 0.72), intracerebral hemorrhage events (p = 0.69), pneumonia (p = 0.75), and TIA (p = 0.24) but would inevitably cause RIC-related adverse events (OR 26.79, 95% CI [12.08, 59.38]).RIC could reduce the stroke recurrence and improve patients' prognosis. Intervention on bilateral upper limbs, 5 cycles, and a length of 50 min in each intervention might be an optimal protocol for RIC at present. RIC could be an effective therapy for patients not eligible for reperfusion therapy. RIC would not cause other adverse events except for relatively benign RIC-related adverse events.","['ischemia', 'meta-analysis', 'randomized controlled trials', 'remote ischemic conditioning', 'stroke']",2022-12-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37183283,"Effect of sevoflurane-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil anesthesia on glycocalyx shedding during deep inferior epigastric perforator flap breast reconstruction: a prospective randomized, controlled trial.","The endothelial glycocalyx (EG) is an important structure that regulates vascular homeostasis. Deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap is expected to cause substantial EG breakdown owing to the long procedural duration and ischemia- reperfusion injury. This prospective, randomized, controlled study aimed to compare syndecan-1 levels during sevoflurane-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in patients who underwent DIEP flap breast reconstruction.Fifty-one patients were randomized to either sevoflurane (n = 26) or propofol (n = 25) groups. Anesthesia was maintained with remifentanil in combination with either sevoflurane or propofol. The primary endpoint was the concentration of serum syndecan-1 measured at 1 h after surgery.Fifty patients (98.0%) completed the study. Patients in the propofol group had significantly lower levels of syndecan-1 than patients in the sevoflurane group at 1 h after operation (23.8 ± 1.6 vs. 30.9 ± 1.7 ng/ml, respectively; Bonferroni corrected P = 0.012). There were no significant differences between groups in postoperative complications. The postoperative hospital stay was 8.4 ± 2.5 days in the sevoflurane group and 7.4 ± 1.0 days in the propofol group (P = 0.077).Propofol-remifentanil anesthesia resulted in lesser increases in syndecan-1 levels compared to increases with sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia in patients who underwent DIEP flap reconstruction. Our results suggest that propofol-remifentanil anesthesia shows protective effects against EG damage during DIEP flap breast reconstruction in contrast to sevoflurane-remifentanil anesthesia.","['Anesthesia, inhalation', 'Anesthesia, intravenous', 'Breast cancer', 'Breast reconstruction', 'Glycocalyx', 'Syndecan-1']",2022-09-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37182836,Fucoidan (A sulfated polysaccharide) and Cerebroprotein in combination alleviate the neuroinflammation-mediated neural damage and functional deficits in the focal cerebral ischemia model of rat.,"Cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury could emanate a cascade of events ensuing in neural death and severe neurobehavioural deficits. The currently available interventions have failed to target the multimodal, interlinked mechanisms that operate cerebral ischemia-induced damage and functional loss. So an integrative intervention has become a mandate to overcome the deleterious mechanisms involved in cerebral ischemic pathophysiology. In this study, adult male Sprague dawley rats were exposed to 2 hours of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (rMCAo) followed by reperfusion, and the intervention group received Fucoidan alone at a dose of 50mg/kg, i.p (intraperitoneal), Cerebrolysin alone at a dose of 2.5mg/kg body weight and the combination of both. The sham rats were exposed to surgical procedures, except for the rMCAo. The assessments of the groups were made 24 hours after the rMCAo. The stand-alone treatment with Fucoidan, Cerebrolysin has shown a better outcome in the neurobehavioral and, histopathological assessments and the combination has made a significant reduction in the neurological deficits and the infarct volume when compared to the standalone groups. The BBB integrity was well preserved in the combination group when compared with the lesion and standalone groups. Moreover, the combined intervention reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, NFkB, IL1α, IL1-β, IL-6, CD68, COX-2, and mRNA expression of inflammatory genes IL1α, IL1-β, IL-6, IBA-1, and COX-2 effectively. In conclusion, the present study suggests that rMCAo induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioural alterations were attenuated by intervention with a combination of Fucoidan and cerebrolysin; Further, Fucoidan and Cerebrolysin combination improved the ischemic tolerance level by promoting the proteins and genes that regulate the inflammatory cytokines and in aiding better recovery after ischemic reperfusion injury.","['BBB', 'Cerebral ischemia', 'Cerebrolysin', 'Fucoidan', 'Middle cerebral artery occlusion', 'Neuroinflammation']",2022-07-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37182688,Induced pluripotent stem cells-podocytes promote repair in acute kidney injury is dependent on Mafb/CCR5/Nampt axis-mediated M2 macrophage polarization.,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been the focus of cellular therapy studies. The use of iPSCs in regenerative medicine is limited by their tumorigenic potential. This study sought to determine whether iPSCs-derived podocytes attenuate acute kidney injury (AKI) and the molecular mechanism. Inoculation of iPSCs-podocytes significantly promoted the repair of kidney injury in AKI mice, reduced the levels of kidney injury factors Scr, BUN, and urinary NAG, and alleviated the inflammatory response. Histological analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of M2 macrophages and a significant decrease in M1 macrophages in the kidney tissues. Subsequently, the genes and signaling pathways that may be associated with kidney injury repair in mice were analyzed by RNA-seq and bioinformatics prediction. The polarization of M2 macrophages was promoted by MAF bZIP transcription factor B (Mafb)-mediated activation of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (Ccr5) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) signaling pathway. Taken together, these results show that iPSCs-podocytes depend on Mafb to activate the Nampt signaling pathway through transcriptional activation of Ccr5, thereby promoting the repair of AKI caused by ischemia-reperfusion.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Ccr5/Nampt signaling', 'M2 macrophage polarization', 'Mafb', 'Stem cell transplantation']",2023-02-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37182101,MRPL12-ANT3 interaction involves in acute kidney injury via regulating MPTP of tubular epithelial cells.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious disease with no effective treatment. Abnormal opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is an important pathological process in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), the key factor of AKI. It is essential to elucidate MPTP regulation mechanism. Here, we identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L7/L12 (MRPL12) specifically binds to adenosine nucleotide translocase 3 (ANT3) under normal physiological conditions, stabilizes MPTP and maintains mitochondrial membrane homeostasis in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). During AKI, MRPL12 expression was significantly decreased in TECs, and MRPL12-ANT3 interaction was reduced, leading to ANT3 conformation change, MPTP abnormal opening, and cell apoptosis. Importantly, MRPL12 overexpression protected TECs from MPTP abnormal opening and apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Our results suggest MRPL12-ANT3 axis involves in AKI by regulating MPTP, and MRPL12 could be potential intervention target for treatment of AKI.","['Bioengineering', 'Cell engineering', 'Injury']",2022-11-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37181854,Effect of crocin on experimental gastrocnemius muscle ischemia/reperfusion injury in rat.,"Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury to the lower extremities causes damage to various tissues, notably the limbs. Because research in recent years have demonstrated that saffron and its components are useful in ischemic strokes, the goal of this study was to see whether Crocin (Cr), one of the active constituents in saffron, could protect the gastrocnemius muscle from IR injury. A total number of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups randomly: control, Cr, IR, and IR + Cr. Xylazine and ketamine were used to anesthetize all of the rats. The left lower limbs of the other two groups were subjected to 2 hr of ischemia and 2 hr of reperfusion with tourniquet, with the exception of the control and Cr groups. Tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels were assessed in the blood as well as muscle IL-6, IL1β, SOD1-2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression. According to the IR group, increases in TAS levels and decreases in TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels were substantial in the Cr therapy group. Cr significantly reduced IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expression levels in the muscle of the IR group and increased superoxide dismutases 1 (SOD1), SOD2, catalase (CAT), and GPx. Our data showed that Cr protected the gastrocnemius muscle from IR injury in rats and reduced inflammatory markers significantly. These effects of Cr might have been mediated by improved antioxidant enzyme activity, suppression of free radical generation and reduction of oxidative stress.","['Crocin', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Oxidative stress', 'Saffron', 'TNF-α']",2022-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37181847,Neuroprotective approach in acute ischemic stroke: A systematic review of clinical and experimental studies.,"Ischemic stroke is a disease with worldwide economic and social negative effects. It is a serious disease with high disability and mortality. Ionic imbalance, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation are induced during and after ischemic stroke. Cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, and necrosis are activated directly or indirectly mechanisms. The studies about neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases have increased in recent years. Data about the mechanisms of progressive molecular improvement in the brain tissue are increasing in acute ischemic stroke. Based on these data, preclinical and clinical studies on new neuroprotective treatments are being designed. An effective neuroprotective strategy can prolong the indication period of recanalization treatments in the acute stage of ischemic stroke. In addition, it can reduce neuronal necrosis and protect the brain against ischemia-related reperfusion injury. The current review has evaluated the recent clinical and experimental studies. The molecular mechanism of each of the neuroprotective strategies is also summarized.

Physical exercise is a well-recognized effective non-pharmacological therapy for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review was to analyze studies in animal models of ischemia-reperfusion in association with physical exercise protocols.Articles published on the topic over a 13-year period (2010-2022) were searched in two databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) using the keywords exercise training, ischemia/reperfusion or ischemia reperfusion injury. Meta-analysis and quality assessment of the studies were performed using the Review Manager 5.3 program.From the 238 articles retrieved from PubMed and 200 from Google Scholar, after screening and eligibility assessment, 26 articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. For meta-analysis comparing the group of previously exercised animals with the non-exercised animals and then submitted to ischemia-reperfusion, the infarct size was significantly decreased by exercise (p < 0.00001). In addition, the group exercised had increased heart-to-body weight ratio (p < 0.00001) and improved ejection fraction as measured by echocardiography (p < 0.0004) in comparison to non-exercised animals.We concluded that the animal models of ischemia-reperfusion indicates that exercise reduce infarct size and preserve ejection fraction, associated with beneficial myocardial remodeling.","['Cardio protection', 'Exercise', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Training']",2023-02-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37180997,Current status and prospects of basic research and clinical application of mesenchymal stem cells in acute respiratory distress syndrome.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and clinically devastating disease that causes respiratory failure. Morbidity and mortality of patients in intensive care units are stubbornly high, and various complications severely affect the quality of life of survivors. The pathophysiology of ARDS includes increased alveolar-capillary membrane permeability, an influx of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid, and surfactant dysfunction leading to severe hypoxemia. At present, the main treatment for ARDS is mechanical treatment combined with diuretics to reduce pulmonary edema, which primarily improves symptoms, but the prognosis of patients with ARDS is still very poor. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal cells that possess the capacity to self-renew and also exhibit multilineage differentiation. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as the umbilical cord, endometrial polyps, menstrual blood, bone marrow, and adipose tissues. Studies have confirmed the critical healing and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Recently, the potential of stem cells in treating ARDS has been explored via basic research and clinical trials. The efficacy of MSCs has been shown in a variety of in vivo models of ARDS, reducing bacterial pneumonia and ischemia-reperfusion injury while promoting the repair of ventilator-induced lung injury. This article reviews the current basic research findings and clinical applications of MSCs in the treatment of ARDS in order to emphasize the clinical prospects of MSCs.","['Acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'Inflammatory response', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Pulmonary edema', 'Pulmonary fibrosis', 'Tissue repair']",2022-12-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37180809,Cardioprotective effects of shock wave therapy: A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study on acute ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Cardioprotection strategies remain a new frontier in treating acute myocardial infarction (AMI), aiming at further protect the myocardium from the ischemia-reperfusion damage. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the mechano-transduction effects induced by shock waves (SW) therapy at time of the ischemia reperfusion as a non-invasive cardioprotective innovative approach to trigger healing molecular mechanisms.We evaluated the SW therapy effects in an open-chest pig ischemia-reperfusion (IR) model, with quantitative cardiac Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging performed along the experiments at multiple time points (baseline (B), during ischemia (I), at early reperfusion (ER) (∼15 min), and late reperfusion (LR) (3 h)). AMI was obtained by a left anterior artery temporary occlusion (50 min) in 18 pigs (32 ± 1.9 kg) randomized into SW therapy and control groups. In the SW therapy group, treatment was started at the end of the ischemia period and extended during early reperfusion (600 + 1,200 shots @0.09 J/mm2, f = 5 Hz). The MR protocol included at all time points LV global function assessment, regional strain quantification, native T1 and T2 parametric mapping. Then, after contrast injection (gadolinium), we obtained late gadolinium imaging and extra-cellular volume (ECV) mapping. Before animal sacrifice, Evans blue dye was administrated after re-occlusion for area-at-risk sizing.During ischemia, LVEF decreased in both groups (25 ± 4.8% in controls (p = 0.031), 31.6 ± 3.2% in SW (p = 0.02). After reperfusion, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) remained significantly decreased in controls (39.9 ± 4% at LR vs. 60 ± 5% at baseline (p = 0.02). In the SW group, LVEF increased quickly ER (43.7 ± 11.4% vs. 52.4 ± 8.2%), and further improved at LR (49.4 ± 10.1) (ER vs. LR p = 0.05), close to baseline reference (LR vs. B p = 0.92). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in myocardial relaxation time (i.e. edema) after reperfusion in the intervention group compared to the control group: ΔT1 (MI vs. remote) was increased by 23.2±% for SW vs. +25.2% for the controls, while ΔT2 (MI vs. remote) increased by +24.9% for SW vs. +21.7% for the control group.In conclusion, we showed in an ischemia-reperfusion open-chest swine model that SW therapy, when applied near the relief of 50' LAD occlusion, led to a nearly immediate cardioprotective effect translating to a reduction in the acute ischemia-reperfusion lesion size and to a significant LV function improvement. These new and promising results related to the multi-targeted effects of SW therapy in IR injury need to be confirmed by further in-vivo studies in close chest models with longitudinal follow-up.","['MRI', 'acute myocardial infarction', 'cardioprotection', 'experimental studies', 'mechano-transduction', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'shock wave therapy']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Following treatment with RW, H9c2 cells were subjected to 4 h of hypoxia/3 h of reoxygenation. MTT assay, LDH assay, and flow cytometry were employed to detect cell viability and changes of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, after RW treatment, rats underwent 30 min of ischemia, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Masson and TUNEL staining were performed to measure myocardial damage and apoptosis, respectively. The changes in the levels of proteins were detected by ELISA and western blot. The results showed that RW attenuated the H/R-induced increase in LDH release and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as the apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Meanwhile, RW significantly reduces the ST-segment elevation and improves cardiomyocytes' injury, inhibit the apoptosis induced by I/R in rats. Furthermore, RW could decrease the levels of MDA and increase the levels of SOD, T-AOC. GSH-Px and GSH both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, RW increased the expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, ARE and NQO1, and decreased the expressions of Keap1, activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that RW exerts cardioprotection on H/R injury in H9c2 cells and I/R injury in rats by attenuating oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis via enhancing Nrf2 signaling.","['Apoptosis', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative stress', 'Rhodiola wallichiana var.cholaensis']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Moreover, the predictors of PRS will be analyzed to highlight risk factors. Mediators of PRS and the modes of action of the currently available preventative and management agents that target particular PRS factors will be investigated.Data is drawn from secondary sources from databases of peer-reviewed journals. The bibliographies of select sources were also used to obtain additional data studies using the 'snowball' method.The initial data search provided 1394 studies analyzed using PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. After applying the eligibility criteria, 18 studies were fit for inclusion.The study identified that in addition to the severity of underlying medical conditions, other significant PRS predictors included patient age, sex, duration of cold ischemia, and the surgical technique. While the use of epinephrine and norepinephrine is well-established, further preventative measures commonly involve specifically targeting known mediators of the syndrome, such as antioxidants, vasodilators, free radical scavengers, and anticoagulants. Current management strategies involve supportive therapy. Machine Perfusion may ultimately decrease the risk of PRS.PRS still holds unknowns, including the underlying pathophysiology, controllable factors, and ideal management practices.

37178321,TIMP2 facilitates CIRI through activating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.,"This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) in mice using CIR and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cell models. The study evaluated brain tissue weight, pathological injury, and changes in the expression levels of TIMP2, p-ERK1/2 and NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis-related proteins in brain tissues and hippocampal neurons of CIR mice using established methods such as dry/wet weight measurement, HE staining, qPCR, TUNEL assay, and Western blotting. The results demonstrated a significant increase in brain water content and neuronal apoptosis rate in the experimental groups compared with those in the control group. In particular, the I/R+TIMP2 group showed the highest increase. Additionally, the control group exhibited a clear brain tissue structure, neatly and densely arranged cells with normal morphology, and evenly stained and clear hippocampal tissues. However, the I/R group showed hippocampal structure disorders, interstitial edema, deep nuclear staining, karyopyknosis, and karyorrhexis in brain tissues. The study results further revealed that TIMP2 could aggravate the pathological damage of brain tissues in the I/R+TIMP2 group compared with the I/R group and significantly reduced it in the TIMP2-KD group. Furthermore, the Western blotting results demonstrated that the protein expression levels of TIMP2, p-ERK1/2, t-ERK1/2, NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, GSDMD, Caspase-1, and ASC in brain tissues and hippocampal neurons were significantly higher in the experimental groups than those in the control group. The I/R+TIMP2 group displaying the highest increase and the TIMP2-KD group showing a significant decrease. In conclusion, TIMP2 can contribute to the occurrence and progression of CIRI by activating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.","['ERK1/2', 'NLRP3', 'TIMP2', 'cerebral ischemia reperfusion', 'pyroptosis', 'seahorse organization']",2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37178238,miR-181a targets PTEN to mediate the neuronal injury caused by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation.,"Evidence suggests that the microRNA-181 (miR-181) family performs various roles in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury (CIRI). MiR-181a has been identified as a critical determinant of neuronal survival. Moreover, the significance of miR-181a in controlling neuronal death after CIRI has received little attention. The objective of this study was to assess the role of miR-181a in neuronal cell injury after CIRI. To mimic the in-vitro and in-vivo CIRI, we developed an oxygen-glucose deficiency/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in SH-SY5Y cells and a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats. MiR-181a expression was significantly higher in both in-vivo and in-vitro CIRI models. The overexpression of miR-181a increased cell damage and oxidative stress caused by OGD/R, whereas inhibition of miR-181a reduced both. PTEN has also been found to be a direct miR-181a target. PTEN overexpression reduced cell apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by miR-181a upregulation under an OGD/R condition. Furthermore, we found that the rs322931 A allele was related to increased miR-181a levels in IS peripheral blood and higher susceptibility to IS. The current results offer new insights into the understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of CIRI, as well as possible new treatment candidates.","['Ischemic stroke', 'Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation', 'PTEN', 'Polymorphism', 'miR-181a']",2022-12-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37176647,Current Evidence and Future Perspectives to Implement Continuous and End-Ischemic Use of Normothermic and Oxygenated Hypothermic Machine Perfusion in Clinical Practice.,"The use of high-risk renal grafts for transplantation requires the optimization of pretransplant assessment and preservation reconditioning strategies to decrease the organ discard rate and to improve short- and long-term clinical outcomes. Active oxygenation is increasingly recognized to play a central role in dynamic preservation strategies, independent of preservation temperature, to recondition mitochondria and to restore the cellular energy profile. The oxygen-related decrease in mitochondrial succinate accumulation ameliorates the harmful effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury. The differences between normothermic and hypothermic machine perfusion with regard to organ assessment, preservation, and reconditioning, as well as the logistic and economic implications, are factors to take into consideration for implementation at a local level. Therefore, these different techniques should be considered complementary to the perfusion strategy selected depending on functional intention and resource availability. This review provides an overview of the current clinical evidence of normothermic and oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion, either as a continuous or end-ischemic preservation strategy, and future perspectives.","['hypothermic machine perfusion', 'kidney assessment', 'kidney modulation', 'kidney preservation', 'kidney reconditioning', 'mitochondria', 'normothermic machine perfusion', 'organ preservation', 'oxygenation']",2023-04-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37176603,Warm Ischemia Induces Spatiotemporal Changes in Lysophosphatidylinositol That Affect Post-Reperfusion Injury in Normal and Steatotic Rat Livers.,"Warm ischemia-reperfusion injury is a prognostic factor for hepatectomy and liver transplantation. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. This study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms and identify the predictive markers of post-reperfusion injury. Rats with normal livers were subjected to 70% hepatic warm ischemia for 15, 30, or 90 min, while those with steatotic livers were subjected to 70% hepatic warm ischemia for only 30 min. The liver and blood were sampled at the end of ischemia and 1, 6, and 24 h after reperfusion. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, Suzuki injury scores, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) products were evaluated. The ALT activity and Suzuki scores increased with ischemic duration and peaked at 1 and 6 h after reperfusion, respectively. Steatotic livers subjected to 30 min ischemia and normal livers subjected to 90 min ischemia showed comparable injury. A similar trend was observed for LPO products. Imaging mass spectrometry of normal livers revealed an increase in lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI (18:0)) and a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylinositol (PI (18:0/20:4)) in Zone 1 (central venous region) with increasing ischemic duration; they returned to their basal values after reperfusion. Similar changes were observed in steatotic livers. Hepatic warm ischemia time-dependent acceleration of PI (18:0/20:4) to LPI (18:0) conversion occurs initially in Zone 1 and is more pronounced in fatty livers. Thus, the LPI (18:0)/PI (18:0/20:4) ratio is a potential predictor of post-reperfusion injury.","['imaging mass spectrometry', 'lysophosphatidylinositol', 'warm ischemia and reperfusion injury']",2023-03-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37176051,Is Renal Ischemic Preconditioning an Alternative to Ameliorate the Short- and Long-Term Consequences of Acute Kidney Injury?,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global health problem and has recently been recognized as a risk factor for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments to reduce or prevent AKI, which results in high morbidity and mortality rates. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has emerged as a promising strategy to prevent, to the extent possible, renal tissue from AKI. Several studies have used this strategy, which involves short or long cycles of ischemia/reperfusion (IR) prior to a potential fatal ischemic injury. In most of these studies, IPC was effective at reducing renal damage. Since the first study that showed renoprotection due to IPC, several studies have focused on finding the best strategy to activate correctly and efficiently reparative mechanisms, generating different modalities with promising results. In addition, the studies performing remote IPC, by inducing an ischemic process in distant tissues before a renal IR, are also addressed. Here, we review in detail existing studies on IPC strategies for AKI pathophysiology and the proposed triggering mechanisms that have a positive impact on renal function and structure in animal models of AKI and in humans, as well as the prospects and challenges for its clinical application.","['inflammation', 'oxidative stress', 'remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC)']",2023-03-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37175950,Dihydropyrimidinase-Related Protein 2 Is a New Partner in the Binding between 4E-BP2 and eIF4E Related to Neuronal Death after Cerebral Ischemia.,"Transient cerebral ischemia induces neuronal degeneration, followed in time by secondary delayed neuronal death that is strongly correlated with a permanent inhibition of protein synthesis in vulnerable brain regions, while protein translational rates are recovered in resistant areas. In the translation-regulation initiation step, the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E is a key player regulated by its association with eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), mostly 4E-BP2 in brain tissue. In a previous work, we identified dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP2) as a 4E-BP2-interacting protein. Here, using a proteomic approach in a model of transient cerebral ischemia, a detailed study of DRP2 was performed in order to address the challenge of translation restoration in vulnerable regions. In this report, several DRP2 isoforms that have a specific interaction with both 4E-BP2 and eIF4E were identified, showing significant and opposite differences in this association, and being differentially detected in resistant and vulnerable regions in response to ischemia reperfusion. Our results provide the first evidence of DRP2 isoforms as potential regulators of the 4E-BP2-eIF4E association that would have consequences in the delayed neuronal death under ischemic-reperfusion stress. The new knowledge reported here identifies DRP2 as a new target to promote neuronal survival after cerebral ischemia.","['cerebral ischemia', 'collapsing-response mediator protein 2', 'dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2', 'eIF4E', 'eIF4E-binding protein', 'neuronal death', 'neuroprotection', 'protein phosphorylation', 'proteomics', 'translation regulation']",2023-04-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37175827,Generation and Characterization of CYP2E1-Overexpressing HepG2 Cells to Study the Role of CYP2E1 in Hepatic Hypoxia-Reoxygenation Injury.,"The mechanisms of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs during liver transplantation or surgery, are poorly understood. The purpose of the current study was to generate and characterize a HepG2 cell line with a stable overexpression of CYP2E1 to investigate the role of the enzyme in hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) injury in an ex vivo setting. GFP-tagged CYP2E1 and control clones were developed, and their gene expression and protein levels of GFP and CYP2E1 were determined using RT-PCR and ELISA/Western blot analysis, respectively. Additionally, the CYP2E1 catalytic activity was determined by UPLC-MS/MS analysis of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone formed from the chlorzoxazone substrate. The CYP2E1 and control clones were subjected to hypoxia (10 h) and reoxygenation (0.5 h), and cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were quantitated using LDH and flow cytometry, respectively. Compared with the control clone, the selected CYP2E1 clone showed a 720-fold increase in CYP2E1 expression and a prominent band in the western blot analysis, which was associated with a 150-fold increase in CYP2E1 catalytic activity. The CYP2E1 clone produced 2.3-fold more ROS and 1.9-fold more cell death in the H/R model. It is concluded that the constitutive CYP2E1 in the liver may play a detrimental role in hepatic I/R injury.","['CYP2E1', 'HepG2 cells', 'cell death', 'cytochrome P450', 'hepatic ischemia-reperfusion', 'hypoxia-reoxygenation', 'reactive oxygen species']",2023-03-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37175793,Immunohistochemical Pattern of Histone H2A Variant Expression in an Experimental Model of Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Acute Kidney Injury.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a frequent cause of AKI, resulting in vasoconstriction, cellular dysfunction, inflammation and the induction of oxidative stress. DNA damage, including physical DNA strand breaks, is also a potential consequence of renal IRI. The histone H2A variants, primary H2AX and H2AZ participate in DNA damage response pathways to promote genome stability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical pattern of histone H2A variants' (H2AX, γH2AX(S139), H2AXY142ph and H2AZ) expression in an experimental model of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Comparing the immunohistochemical nuclear expression of γH2AX(S139) and H2AXY142ph in AKI, we observed that there is an inverse ratio of these two histone H2AX variants. If we follow different regions from the subcapsular structures to the medulla, there is an increasing extent gradient in the nuclear expression of H2AXY142ph, accompanied by a decreasing nuclear expression of γH2AX. In addition, we observed that different structures dominated when γH2AX and H2AXY142ph expression levels were compared. γH2AX was expressed only in the proximal tubule, with the exception of when they were dilated. In the medulla, H2AXY142ph is predominantly expressed in the loop of Henle and the collecting ducts. Our results show moderate sporadic nuclear H2AZ expression mainly in the cells of the distal tubules and the collecting ducts that were surrounded by dilated tubules with PAS (periodic acid-Schiff stain)-positive casts. These findings may indicate the degree of DNA damage, followed by postischemic AKI, with potential clinical and prognostic implications regarding this condition.","['AKI', 'H2AZ', 'histone', 'immunohistochemistry', 'ischemic–reperfusion injury', 'γH2AX']",2023-03-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37175519,SerpinA3K Deficiency Reduces Oxidative Stress in Acute Kidney Injury.,"We previously showed that SerpinA3K is present in urine from rats and humans with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the specific role of SerpinA3K during renal pathophysiology is unknown. To begin to understand the role of SerpinA3K on AKI, SerpinA3K-deficient (KOSA3) mice were studied 24 h after inducing ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and compared to wild type (WT) mice. Four groups were studied: WT+S, WT+IR, KOSA3+S, and KOSA3+IR. As expected, I/R increased serum creatinine and BUN, with a GFR reduction in both genotypes; however, renal dysfunction was ameliorated in the KOSA3+IR group. Interestingly, the increase in UH2O2 induced by I/R was not equally seen in the KOSA3+IR group, an effect that was associated with the preservation of antioxidant enzymes' mRNA levels. Additionally, FOXO3 expression was initially greater in the KOSA3 than in the WT group. Moreover, the increase in BAX protein level and the decrease in Hif1a and Vegfa induced by I/R were not observed in the KOSA3+IR group, suggesting that these animals have better cellular responses to hypoxic injury. Our findings suggest that SerpinA3K is involved in the renal oxidant response, HIF1α/VEGF pathway, and cell apoptosis.","['FOXO3', 'HIF1a', 'renal ischemia/reperfusion']",2023-03-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37175228,Fatty Acids and Bilirubin as Intrinsic Autofluorescence Serum Biomarkers of Drug Action in a Rat Model of Liver Ischemia and Reperfusion.,"The autofluorescence of specific fatty acids, retinoids, and bilirubin in crude serum can reflect changes in liver functional engagement in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. The role of these fluorophores as intrinsic biomarkers of pharmacological actions has been investigated here in rats administered with obeticholic acid (OCA), a Farnesoid-X Receptor (FXR) agonist, proven to counteract the increase of serum bilirubin in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been applied to an assay serum collected from rats submitted to liver I/R (60/60 min ± OCA administration). The I/R group showed changes in the amplitude and profiles of emission spectra excited at 310 or 366 nm, indicating remarkable alterations in the retinoid and fluorescing fatty acid balance, with a particular increase in arachidonic acid. The I/R group also showed an increase in bilirubin AF, detected in the excitation spectra recorded at 570 nm. OCA greatly reversed the effects observed in the I/R group, confirmed by the biochemical analysis of bilirubin and fatty acids. These results are consistent with a relationship between OCA anti-inflammatory effects and the acknowledged roles of fatty acids as precursors of signaling agents mediating damaging responses to harmful stimuli, supporting serum autofluorescence analysis as a possible direct, real-time, cost-effective tool for pharmacological investigations.","['arachidonic acid', 'bilirubin', 'endogenous fluorophores', 'linoleic acid', 'liquid optical biopsy', 'spectral fitting analysis']",2023-04-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37175144,Positive Tetrahydrocurcumin-Associated Brain-Related Metabolomic Implications.,"Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) is a metabolite of curcumin (CUR). It shares many of CUR's beneficial biological activities in addition to being more water-soluble, chemically stable, and bioavailable compared to CUR. However, its mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. This paper addresses the preventive role of THC on various brain dysfunctions as well as its effects on brain redox processes, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease in various animal or cell culture models. In addition to its strong antioxidant properties, the effects of THC on the reduction of amyloid β aggregates are also well documented. The therapeutic potential of THC to treat patterns of mitochondrial brain dysmorphic dysfunction is also addressed and thoroughly reviewed, as is evidence from experimental studies about the mechanism of mitochondrial failure during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. THC treatment also results in a dose-dependent decrease in ERK-mediated phosphorylation of GRASP65, which prevents further compartmentalization of the Golgi apparatus. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is possibly the most involved mechanism in the anti-apoptotic effect of THC. Overall, studies in various animal models of different brain disorders suggest that THC can be used as a dietary supplement to protect against traumatic brain injury and even improve brain function in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We suggest further preclinical studies be conducted to demonstrate the brain-protective, anti-amyloid, and anti-Parkinson effects of THC. Application of the methods used in the currently reviewed studies would be useful and should help define doses and methods of THC administration in different disease conditions.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Parkinson’s disease', 'antioxidants', 'brain injury', 'curcumin', 'mitochondria', 'reactive oxygen species', 'tetrahydrocurcumin']",2023-02-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37173347,Vitamin D receptor attenuate ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury via inhibiting ATF4.,"Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is one of the key effectors of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), ATF4/CHOP pathway-mediated ERS plays an important role in the progression of acute kidney disease (AKI). We have previously reported that Vitamin D receptor (VDR) exert renoprotection in rodent AKI models. However, whether ATF4, as well as ERS, is involved in the protective effect of VDR in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced AKI is unknown. Herein, we showed that VDR agonist paricalcitol and VDR overexpression alleviated I/R-induced renal injury and cells apoptosis with decreased ATF4 and attenuated ERS, while VDR deletion significantly resulted in further increased ATF4, more drastic ERS and renal injury in I/R mice models. In addition, paricalcitol remarkably reduced Tunicamycin (TM) induced ATF4 and ERS with attenuated renal injury, while VDR deletion aggravated the above changes in TM mice models. Moreover, overexpression of ATF4 partially abolished the effect of paricalcitol against TM-induced ERS and apoptosis, while inhibition of ATF4 enhanced the protective effect of paricalcitol. Bioinformatics analysis indicated potential VDR binding sites on ATF4 promotor sequence which were further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In conclusion, VDR attenuated I/R-induced AKI by suppressing ERS partly via transcriptional regulation of ATF4.",[],2023-03-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37172886,Liraglutide alleviates myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion injury in diabetic mice.,"Diabetic patients are prone to acute myocardial infarction. Although reperfusion therapy can preserve the viability of the myocardium, it also causes fatal ischemia‒reperfusion injury. Diabetes can exacerbate myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion injury, but the mechanism is unclear. We aimed to characterize the effects of liraglutide on the prevention of ischemia‒reperfusion injury and inadequate autophagy. Liraglutide reduced the myocardial infarction area and improved cardiac function in diabetic mice. We further demonstrated that liraglutide mediated these protective effects by activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy. Liraglutide markedly increased p-AMPK levels and the LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and reduced p-mTOR levels and p62 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR increased cell viability and autophagy levels in high glucose and H/R-treated H9C2 cells. Overall, our study reveals that liraglutide acts upstream of the AMPK/mTOR pathway to effectively counteract high glucose- and H/R-induced cell dysfunction by activating AMPK/mTOR-dependent autophagy, providing a basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of ischemia‒reperfusion in diabetes.","['AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway', 'Autophagy', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Ischemia‒reperfusion injury', 'Liraglutide']",2023-02-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Reports such as that of Doo Sun Sim, et al. suggest that the impact of MTA may become clinically relevant in patients with a longer total ischemia time1. We present the case of an adult male, with multiple risk factors for coronary disease, with lower STEMI, due to occlusion of the right coronary artery with a heavy thrombus load and an ischemia time of 10 hours. It was successfully treated by MTA, removing abundant intracoronary thrombus and obtaining a TIMI III flow, without requiring stent implantation. The case, the evolution and the current knowledge regarding the use of AT are discussed.

37172449,Albumin protects the ultrastructure of the endothelial glycocalyx of coronary arteries in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in vivo.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury induces endothelial glycocalyx (GCX) degradation. Several candidate GCX-protective factors including albumin have been identified, few have been demonstrated in in vivo studies and most albumins used to date have been heterologous. Albumin is a carrier protein for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which has protective effects on the cardiovascular system. However, changes inhibited by albumin in the endothelial GCX structure in I/R in vivo via the S1P receptor has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to determine whether albumin prevents the shedding of endothelial GCX in response to I/R in vivo. Rats were divided into four groups: control (CON), I/R, I/R with albumin preload (I/R + ALB), and I/R + ALB with S1P receptor agonist fingolimod (I/R + ALB + FIN). FIN acts as an initial agonist of S1P receptor 1 and downregulates the receptor in an inhibitory manner. The CON and I/R groups received saline and I/R + ALB and I/R + ALB + FIN groups received albumin solution before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Our study used rat albumin. Shedding of endothelial GCX was evaluated in the myocardium by electron microscopy, and the concentration of serum syndecan-1 was measured. Thus, albumin administration maintained the structure of endothelial GCX and prevented shedding of endothelial GCX via the S1P receptor in myocardial I/R, and FIN annihilated the protective effect of albumin against I/R injury.","['Albumin', 'Electron microscopy', 'Glycocalyx', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Sphingosine-1-phosphate']",2023-03-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37172425,BRG1 alleviates microglial activation by promoting the KEAP1-NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway and minimizing oxidative damage in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.,"BRG1 is a key factor in the process of apoptosis and oxidative damage; however, its role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we discovered that during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion in mice, microglia were significantly activated in the cerebral cortex of the infarct area, and BRG1 expression was increased in the mouse MCAO/R model, peaking at 4 days. In microglia subjected to OGD/R, BRG1 expression increased and peaked at 12 h after reoxygenation. After ischemic stroke, in vitro changing the expression of BRG1 expression levels greatly altered the activation of microglia and the production of antioxidant and pro-oxidant proteins. Knocking down BRG1 expression levels in vitro increased the inflammatory response, promoted microglial activation, and decreased the expression of the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway after ischemic stroke. In contrast, overexpression of BRG1 dramatically reduced the expression of NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway and microglial activation. Our research reveals that BRG1 reduces postischemic oxidative damage via the KEAP1-NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway, protecting against brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. Using BRG1 as a pharmaceutical target to inhibit inflammatory responses to reduce oxidative damage may be a unique way to explore techniques for the treatment of ischemic stroke and other cerebrovascular illnesses.","['BRG1', 'Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion', 'Microglia']",2023-01-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37171284,"Association between apelin-12 and creatine kinase-MB, depending on success of reperfusion in STEMI patients.","Acute myocardial infarction is characterised by an imbalance in the supply and demand of oxygen in the heart. It requires urgent reperfusion, and poor outcomes are attributed to myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We aimed to evaluate the association between apelin-12 levels and creatine kinase-MB activity in predicting the effectiveness of reperfusion therapy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.In this study we included 72 patients with the following criteria: chest pain suggestive of myocardial ischaemia for at least 30 minutes, an electrocardiogram with ST-segment elevation (measured at the J-point) ≥ 2 mm in leads V2-V3 and/or ≥ 1 mm in the other leads, rise of specific biomarkers such as cardiac troponin and the MB fraction of creatine kinase (CK-MB), and those who underwent reperfusion therapy. Blood samples for the measurement of apelin-12 and creatine kinase-MB were collected 12 hours after the reperfusion therapy.In patients with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade ≤ 2, the median of the apelin-12 level was 1.80 ng/ml (0.46-9.20), and with TIMI flow 3, it was 5.76 ng/ml (1.14-15.2). Variability was observed in the apelin values (Mann-Whitney test) based on TIMI flow grade (p < 0.001), while no variability was observed for creatine kinase-MB (p < 0.18). The degree of association between apelin-12 and creatine kinase-MB levels was analysed with Pearson's correlation, enabling us to determine patients with successful reperfusion (determined as TIMI flow 3) (p < 0.004), and those with unsuccessful reperfusion (with TIMI flow ≤ 2) (p = 0.86).In STEMI patients undergoing reperfusion therapy, Apelin-12 level was associated with creatine kinase-MB activity according to the success of the reperfusion.","['apelin', 'myocardial infarction', 'reperfusion']",2020-09-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37170554,Neuroprotective Effects of an N-Salicyloyl Tryptamine Derivative against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a key reason for the poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. As only a few neuroprotective medications for cerebral I/R injury have been applied in the clinic, it is necessary to design a new therapeutic strategy to treat cerebral I/R injury. The N-salicyloyl tryptamine derivative LZWL02003, synthesized from melatonin and salicylic acid, exhibits a wide range of biological properties. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective capabilities of LZWL02003 in vivo and in vitro and investigated its possible mechanisms. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation was utilized to create an in vitro model of cerebral I/R damage. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion was employed to imitate cerebral I/R injury in vivo. Neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are associated with the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury. Our findings demonstrated that LZWL02003 upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Bax, thus maintaining the homeostasis of Bcl-2/Bax proteins and preventing apoptosis. LZWL02003 also reduced oxidative stress by reducing malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species levels, increasing the superoxide dismutase activity, and resolving mitochondrial malfunction. LZWL02003 can lower interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 levels, which in turn suppress neuroinflammation. Activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway is involved in various pathophysiologies, including cerebral I/R injury. We discovered that LZWL02003 suppressed the phosphorylation activation of NF-κB pathway-related proteins and decreased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunits. Taken together, our results suggest that LZWL02003 is a neuroprotective drug with pleiotropic effects and may be a candidate for treating cerebral I/R injury.","['N-salicyloyl tryptamine', 'NF-κB', 'apoptosis', 'cerebral ischemia and reperfusion', 'neuroinflammation', 'oxidative stress']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37169762,Single-cell sequencing reveals homogeneity and heterogeneity of the cytopathological mechanisms in different etiology-induced AKI.,"Homogeneity and heterogeneity of the cytopathological mechanisms in different etiology-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell sequencing (scRNA) on mouse kidneys with five common AKI etiologies (CP-Cisplatin, IRI-Ischemia-reperfusion injury, UUO-Unilateral ureteral obstruction, FA-Folic acid, and SO-Sodium oxalate). We constructed a potent multi-model AKI scRNA atlas containing 20 celltypes with 80,689 high-quality cells. The data suggest that compared to IRI and CP-AKI, FA- and SO-AKI exhibit injury characteristics more similar to UUO-AKI, which may due to tiny crystal-induced intrarenal obstruction. Through scRNA atlas, 7 different functional proximal tubular cell (PTC) subtypes were identified, we found that Maladaptive PTCs and classical Havcr1 PTCs but not novel Krt20 PTCs affect the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic levels in different AKI models. And cell death and cytoskeletal remodeling events are widespread patterns of injury in PTCs. Moreover, we found that programmed cell death predominated in PTCs, whereas apoptosis and autophagy prevailed in the remaining renal tubules. We also identified S100a6 as a novel AKI-endothelial injury biomarker. Furthermore, we revealed that the dynamic and active immune (especially Arg1 Macro_2 cells) -parenchymal cell interactions are important features of AKI.

37169167,The Function of Spag6 to Repair Brain Edema Damage After Cerebral Ischemic Stroke-reperfusion.,"Sperm associated antigen 6 (Spag6) is the PF16 homolog of Chlamydomonas and participates in the regulation of cilia movement. Studies have shown that Spag6 is expressed in the brain, and its loss will lead to cerebral edema caused by a defect in motor cilium function in ependymal cells. However, it has not been reported whether the limited or extensive cerebral edema resulting from ischemic strokes is related to the expression regulation of Spag6. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and related mechanism of Spag6 in alleviating Cerebral Ischemic stroke-reperfusion (CIS/R) damage. Our experimental results showed that Spag6 overexpression alleviated CIS/R-mediated motor cilia structural disorder, improved cerebral edema, inhibited nerve injuries in rats with cerebral ischemia, and alleviated synaptic and dendritic spinal injuries by regulating the expressions of synaptic-related proteins such as CaMKII, PSD95, and CREB. Based on significant changes in PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway activity after CIS/R determination, we determined that Spag6 regulates the abnormal expression of CIS/R-induced inflammatory factors NF-κB, NLRP3, IL-10, and the autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1, LC3, and P62 by activating the PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.

37168554,Dynamic cellular changes in acute kidney injury caused by different ischemia time.,"Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), often related to surgical procedures, is one of the important causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). To decipher the dynamic process of AKI caused by IRI (with prolonged ischemia phase), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of clinically relevant IRI murine model with different ischemic intervals. We discovered that Slc5a2hi proximal tubular cells were susceptible to AKI and highly expressed neutral amino acid transporter gene Slc6a19, which was dramatically decreased over the time course. With the usage of mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis, we detected that the level of neutral amino acid isoleucine dropped off in AKI mouse plasma metabolites. And the reduction of plasma isoleucine was also verified in patients with cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI). The findings advanced the understanding of dynamic process of AKI and introduced reduction of isoleucine as a potential biomarker for CSA-AKI.","['Disease', 'Metabolomics', 'Model organism', 'Transcriptomics']",2022-10-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37164544,Methods for studying primary cilia in heart tissue after ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. After heart injury triggered by myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, extensive zones of tissue are damaged and some of the tissue dies by necrosis and/or apoptosis. The loss of contractile mass activates a series of biochemical mechanisms that allow, through cardiac remodeling, the replacement of the dysfunctional heart tissue by fibrotic material. Our previous studies have shown that primary cilia, non-motile antenna-like structures at the cell surface required for the activation of specific signaling pathways, are present in cardiac fibroblasts and required for cardiac fibrosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice. I/R-induced myocardial fibrosis promotes the enrichment of ciliated cardiac fibroblasts where the myocardial injury occurs. Given discussions about the existence of cilia in specific cardiac cell types, as well as the functional relevance of studying cilia-dependent signaling in cardiac fibrosis after I/R, here we describe our methods to evaluate the presence and roles of primary cilia in cardiac fibrosis after I/R in mice.","['Cardiovascular diseases', 'Fibrosis', 'Heart', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Primary cilia']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37164525,Biomarkers of Thrombotic Status Predict Spontaneous Reperfusion in Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,"Spontaneous reperfusion, seen in ∼20% of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), manifests as normal epicardial flow in the infarct-related artery, with or without ST-segment resolution, before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The drivers mediating this are unknown.The authors sought to relate spontaneous reperfusion to the thrombotic profile.In a prospective study, blood from STEMI patients (n = 801) was tested pre-PCI to assess in vitro, point-of-care, occlusion times (OT) and endogenous lysis times (LT). Spontaneous reperfusion was defined as infarct-related artery Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 before PCI. Patients were followed for major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke).Spontaneous reperfusion was associated with a longer OT (435 seconds vs 366 seconds; P < 0.001) and a shorter LT (1,257 seconds vs 1,616 seconds; P < 0.001), lower troponin, and better left ventricular function. LT was superior to OT for predicting spontaneous reperfusion (area under the curve for LT: 0.707; 95% CI: 0.661-0.753; area under the curve for OT: 0.629; 95% CI: 0.581-0.677). Among patients with spontaneous reperfusion, those with complete, vs partial ST-segment resolution, had a longer OT (P = 0.002) and a shorter LT (P < 0.001). Spontaneous reperfusion was unrelated to clinical characteristics or pain-to-angiography times. Over 4 years, patients with spontaneous reperfusion experienced fewer major adverse cardiovascular events than those without (4.1% vs 10.6%; P = 0.013), especially in those with both spontaneous reperfusion and complete ST-segment resolution (1.5% vs 10.1%; P = 0.029).We demonstrate a novel hematological signature in STEMI patients with spontaneous reperfusion, namely, decreased platelet reactivity and faster endogenous fibrinolysis, relating to smaller infarcts and improved survival. This finding indicates a role for modulating thrombotic status early after STEMI onset, to facilitate spontaneous reperfusion and improve outcomes.","['endogenous fibrinolysis', 'myocardial infarction', 'platelet reactivity', 'spontaneous reperfusion', 'thrombotic status']",2023-02-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37164261,Peroxiredoxin 1 aggravates acute kidney injury by promoting inflammation through Mincle/Syk/NF-κB signaling.,"Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are a cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). Our knowledge of these DAMPs remains incomplete. Here, we report serum peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) as a novel DAMP for AKI. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury instigated AKI with concurrent increases in serum Prdx1 and reductions of Prdx1 expression in kidney tubular epithelial cells. Genetic knockout of Prdx1 or use of a Prdx1-neutralizing antibody protected mice from AKI and this protection was impaired by introduction of recombinant Prdx1 (rPrdx1). Mechanistically, lipopolysaccharide increased serum and kidney proinflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and the content of M1 macrophages. All these events were suppressed in Prdx1-/- mice and renewed upon introduction of rPrdx1. In primary peritoneal macrophages, rPrdx1 induced M1 polarization, activated macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) signaling, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production. Prdx1 interacted with Mincle to initiate acute kidney inflammation. Of note, rPrdx1 upregulated Mincle and the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk system in the primary peritoneal macrophages, while knockdown of Mincle abolished the increase in activated Syk. Additionally, rPrdx1 treatment enhanced the downstream events of Syk, including transcription factor NF-κB signaling pathways. Furthermore, serum Prdx1 was found to be increased in patients with AKI; the increase of which was associated with kidney function decline and inflammatory biomarkers in patient serum. Thus, kidney-derived serum Prdx1 contributes to AKI at least in part by activating Mincle signaling and downstream pathways.","['Mincle', 'acute kidney injury', 'damage-associated molecular pattern', 'inflammation', 'peroxiredoxin 1']",2022-08-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37163431,Dynamic Detection of Specific Membrane Capacitance and Cytoplasmic Resistance of Neutrophils After Ischemic Stroke.,"Peripheral blood is the most readily available resource for stroke patient prognosis, but there is a lack of methods to detect dynamic changes of neutrophils in peripheral blood that can be used in the clinic. Herein, we developed a procedure to characterize dynamic changes of neutrophils based on their electrical properties in rats after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We characterized the specific membrane capacitance (Csm) and cytoplasmic resistance (σcyto) of approximately 27,600 neutrophils from MCAO rats 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion. We found that the Csm and σcyto of neutrophils in the MCAO group were significantly higher compared to the sham group. Furthermore, we observed a monotonically upward shift in neutrophil Csm in the MCAO group during the four 5-minute test cycles. Our findings suggest that the dynamic changes of cellular electrical properties could reflect neutrophil activity and serve as a prognostic indicator for ischemic stroke in the clinical setting.",[],2022-10-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37162502,Dexmedetomidine enables copper homeostasis in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion via ferredoxin 1.,"Excessive oxygen free radicals and toxic substances are generated in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) process. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a common anesthetic and sedative drug, can considerably boost glutathione (GSH), which has anti-copper influx effects. Focusing on cuproptosis, the mechanism of DEX in the I/R was revealed. Using the I/R rat model, the effects of DEX and the copper chelator D-penicillamine on cerebral infarct volume, copper levels, mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, GSH content, and enrichment of cuproptosis functional proteins were examined. The involvement of ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) in the DEX regulatory pathway was verified by overexpressing FDX1 in vitro. DEX could significantly reduce cerebral infarction in rats, reduce copper levels, maintain mitochondrial functions, increase GSH, and reduce the content of key proteins related to cuproptosis. These aspects were replicated in vitro and revealed that FDX1 overexpression partially reversed the impacts of DEX. Together, cuproptosis occurs in the brain I/R process and DEX can enhance cell survival by blocking the primary pathway mediated by FDX1.KEY MESSAGESDexmedetomidine reduces cerebral infarction in the I/R rat models.Dexmedetomidine reduces cuproptosis in the I/R rat models.FDX1, an upstream of protein fatty acylation, mediates regulation of Dexmedetomidine.","['Cuproptosis', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'dexmedetomidine']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37161799,[Effects of acupuncture on neurologic function and serum inflammatory factors after thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke].,"To observe the effects of acupuncture on neurologic function and serum inflammatory factors in patients after thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS).A total of 102 AIS patients with onset to treatment time (OTT) ≤3 h were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 51 cases each group. In the control group, thrombolysis and conventional medical treatment were applied. On the basis of the treatment as the control group, acupuncture at Shuigou (GV 26), Zhongwan (CV 12), Qihai (CV 6), Neiguan (PC 6), etc. was applied in the observation group, 30 min each time, once a day. Both groups were treated for 2 weeks. Before and after treatment, the scores of National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin scale (mRS), modified Barthel index (MBI) and serum level of homocysteine (Hcy), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were compared, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated in the two groups.After treatment, the scores of NIHSS, mRS and serum level of Hcy, hs-CRP were decreased compared with those before treatment (P<0.05), while the MBI scores were increased (P<0.05) in the two groups. The scores of NIHSS, mRS and serum level of Hcy, hs-CRP in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P<0.05, P<0.01), the MBI score in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (P<0.01). The total effective rate was 88.2% (45/51) in the observation group, which was superior to 70.6% (36/51) in the control group (P<0.05).Acupuncture could promote the recovery of neurologic function in patients after thrombolysis in AIS, improve the ability of daily living, which may be related to reducing the level of inflammatory factors, thus inhibiting inflammatory response and improving cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury.目的：观察针刺对急性缺血性脑卒中（AIS）溶栓患者神经功能及血清炎性因子水平的影响。方法：将102例发病至进行溶栓的治疗时间（OTT）≤3 h的AIS患者随机分为观察组和对照组，每组51例。对照组采用溶栓与内科常规治疗；在对照组治疗基础上，观察组予针刺治疗，穴取水沟、中脘、气海、内关等，每次30 min，每日1次，两组均治疗2周。比较两组患者治疗前后美国国立卫生研究院卒中量表（NIHSS）、改良Rankin量表（mRS）、改良Barthel指数（MBI）评分及血清同型半胱氨酸（Hcy）、超敏C反应蛋白（hs-CRP）水平，并评定两组临床疗效。结果：治疗后，两组患者NIHSS、mRS评分及血清Hcy、hs-CRP水平均较治疗前降低（P<0.05），MBI评分较治疗前升高（P<0.05）；观察组患者NIHSS、mRS评分及血清Hcy、hs-CRP水平均低于对照组（P<0.05，P<0.01），MBI评分高于对照组（P<0.01）。观察组总有效率为88.2%（45/51），高于对照组的70.6%（36/51，P<0.05）。结论：针刺可促进AIS溶栓患者神经功能恢复，改善日常生活能力，可能与降低炎性因子水平从而抑制炎性反应、改善脑血管缺血后再灌注损伤有关。.","['acupuncture', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'inflammatory factor', 'neurologic function', 'randomized controlled trial (RCT)', 'thrombolysis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37161797,LOXL1-AS1 Aggravates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Through the miR-761/PTEN Axis.,"Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (MIRI) has high morbidity and mortality worldwide. We aimed to explore the role of long noncoding RNA lysyl oxidase like 1 antisense RNA 1 (LOXL1-AS1) in cardiomyocyte pyroptosis.Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury was constructed in human cardiomyocyte (HCM). The level of LOXL1-AS1, miR-761, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and pyroptosis-related proteins was monitored by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Flow cytometry examined the pyroptosis level. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin I levels were detected by test kits. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measured the release of inflammatory cytokines. Dual-luciferase assay validated the binding relationship among LOXL1-AS1, miR-761, and PTEN. Finally, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) animal model was constructed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining assessed morphological changes of myocardial tissue. NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and casepase-1 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry.After H/R treatment, LOXL1-AS1 and PTEN were highly expressed but miR-761 level was suppressed. LOXL1-AS1 inhibition or miR-761 overexpression increased cell viability, blocked the release of LDH and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-18), inhibited pyroptosis level, and downregulated pyroptosis-related proteins (ASC, cleaved caspase-1, gasdermin D-N, NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18) levels in HCMs. LOXL1-AS1 sponged miR-761 to up-regulate PTEN. Knockdown of miR-761 reversed the effect of LOXL1-AS1 down regulation on H/R induced HCM pyroptosis. LOXL1-AS1 aggravated the MIRI by regulating miR-761/PTEN axis in vivo.LOXL1-AS1 targeted miR-761 to regulate PTEN expression, then enhance cardiomyocyte pyroptosis, providing a new alternative target for the treatment of MIRI.","['Myocardial ischemia', 'Pyroptosis', 'Reperfusion injury']",2022-11-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37161649,BACH1 encourages ferroptosis by activating KDM4C-mediated COX2 demethylation after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"It has been confirmed that BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) are involved in ferroptosis related diseases. However, the function of BACH1 in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) induced ferroptosis remains to be largely unrevealed. Firstly, analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CIRI based on the GEO dataset GSE119121 revealed that BACH1 was upregulated in CIRI. BACH1 level was prominently increased in MCAO/reperfusion model and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) cell model. Further, knock-down of BACH1 markedly reduced iron ion concentration, ROS production, 4-HNE and lipid peroxidation levels, and facilitated GSH content, cell viability, and protein levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11, while an pcDNA-KDM4C or pcDNA-COX2 combined with BACH1 siRNA could not enhance this effect. Mechanistically, BACH1 bound on the KDM4C promoter to transcriptionally activate its expression. Besides, KDM4C could occupy the promoter locus of the COX2 gene, promoting the COX2 expression by eliminating H3K9me3. Overexpression of KDM4C or COX2 overturned the effects of BACH1 inhibition. In vivo findings displayed that brain infraction, pathological damage, and neuronal loss rate in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice were conspicuously decreased after BACH1 knock-down. This study reveals that BACH1 encourages ferroptosis in neuroblastoma cells and CIRI mouse brain tissues by activating KDM4C-mediated COX2 demethylation.","['BACH1', 'COX2', 'H3K9me3', 'KDM4C', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'ferroptosis']",2022-09-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37158850,TRIM37 exacerbates hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury by facilitating IKKγ translocation.,"Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the major pathological processes associated with various liver surgeries. However, there is still a lack of strategies to protect against hepatic I/R injury because of the unknown underlying mechanism. The present study aimed to identify a potential strategy and provide a fundamental experimental basis for treating hepatic I/R injury.A classic 70% ischemia/reperfusion injury was established. Immunoprecipitation was used to identify direct interactions between proteins. The expression of proteins from different subcellular localizations was detected by Western blotting. Cell translocation was directly observed by immunofluorescence. HE, TUNEL and ELISA were performed for function tests.We report that tripartite motif containing 37 (TRIM37) aggravates hepatic I/R injury through the reinforcement of IKK-induced inflammation following dual patterns. Mechanistically, TRIM37 directly interacts with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), inducing K63 ubiquitination and eventually leading to the phosphorylation of IKKβ. TRIM37 enhances the translocation of IKKγ, a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby stabilizing the cytoplasmic IKK complex and prolonging the duration of inflammation. Inhibition of IKK rescued the function of TRIM37 in vivo and in vitro.Collectively, the present study discloses some potential function of TRIM37 in hepatic I/R injury. Targeting TRIM37 might be potential for treatment against hepatic I/R injury.Targeting TRIM37 might be a potential treatment strategy against hepatic I/R injury.","['IKKγ', 'Inflammation', 'Liver ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'TRAF6', 'TRIM37']",2023-01-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37158301,Ischemic postconditioning protects against acute kidney injury after limb ischemia reperfusion by regulating HMGB1 release and autophagy.,"Ischemic postconditioning (I-PostC) has a protective effect against acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by limb ischemia-reperfusion (LIR); however, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated. Our study aims to investigate the potential involvement of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and autophagy in renoprotection generated by I-PostC. A rat model of LIR-induced AKI was established and rats were randomly assigned to five groups: (i) sham-operated control, (ii) I/R, (iii) I/R + I-PostC, (iv) I/R + I-PostC + rapamycin (autophagy activator), and (v) I/R + I-PostC + 3-methyladenine (autophagy inhibitor). Morphological changes in the kidneys were assessed by histology, and ultrastructural changes in renal tubular epithelial cells and glomerular podocytes were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of kidney function parameters, serum inflammatory factors, and autophagy markers were detected. The results showed that the levels of HMGB1, Beclin1, LC3-II/LC3-I, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) were significantly higher in the I/R group compared to the sham control in serum and in renal tissues. I-PostC significantly reduced the levels of HMGB1, Beclin1, LC3-II/LC3-I, and inflammatory cytokines in renal tissues and improved renal function. Renal histopathology and ultrastructural observations indicated that I-PostC alleviated renal tissue injury. In addition, rapamycin (autophagy activator) treatment increased the levels of inflammatory cytokine expression levels and decreased renal function, reversed the protective effect of I-PostC against LIR-induced AKI. In conclusion, I-PostC could play a protective role against AKI by regulating the release of HMGB1 and inhibiting autophagy activation.","['HMGB1', 'Limb ischemia', 'autophagy', 'ischemic postconditioning', 'kidney']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37158290,Gualou Guizhi decoction promotes therapeutic angiogenesis via the miR210/HIF/VEGF pathway in vivo and in vitro.,"Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) is an ancient Chinese classical prescription widely used to treat ischemic stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms of GLGZD promoting angiogenesis are unavailable.This study investigates the angiogenesis effect of GLGZD as well as its mechanism.Ischemic stroke was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The GLGZD groups received GLGZD (3.6, 7.2 and 14.4 g/kg) orally. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was constructed in HUVECs receiving GLGZD medicated serum (MS). MRI, H&E staining, qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence methods were employed. miRNA210 inhibitor was employed to confirm the effects of GLGZD on promoting angiogenesis. Dual luciferase assay was used to verify the binding of miRNA210 with HIF mRNA.GLGZD treatment improved neurological function (by 27%), alleviated neuronal injury (by 76%), reduced infarct volume (by 74%) and increased microvessel density (by fourfold) in vivo. In vitro data had also shown that GLGZD caused proliferation of the cells (by 58%), their migration, and eventual formation of tubes (by threefold). Simultaneously, GLGZD enhanced the levels of angiogenesis-related molecules and activated the HIF/VEGF signalling pathway. Surprisingly, the beneficial effects of GLGZD on post-stroke angiogenesis and neurological recovery were weakened by miRNA210 inhibitor, and also abolished the mediation of proangiogenic factors. miRNA210 directly targeted HIF mRNA.GLGZD enhances angiogenesis via activation of the miRNA210/HIF/VEGF signalling pathway, suggesting it can be a novel application as an effective angiogenic formula for stroke recovery.","['Ischemic stroke', 'PKC', 'eNOS', 'neurological recovery', 'neuroprotection']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37156030,Exosomes derived from TGF-β1-pretreated mesenchymal stem cells alleviate biliary ischemia-reperfusion injury through Jagged1/Notch1/SOX9 pathway.,"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of exosomes (EXO) derived from TGF-β1-pretreated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on biliary ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and further reveal the possible mechanisms.Bone marrow-derived MSCs were treated with exogenous TGF-β1, Jagged1/Notch1/SOX9 pathway inhibitor LY450139, or their combination. Then, EXO were isolated from the culture supernatants and further characterized. After establishing IRI model of biliary epithelial cells (EpiCs), EXO derived from differently-treated MSCs were applied to detect their protective effects on EpiCs, and LY450139 was applied in EpiCs to detect the possible mechanisms after treatment with MSCs-EXO. EXO derived from differently-treated MSCs were further injected into the hepatic artery immediately after establishment of intrahepatic biliary IRI for animal studies.Pretreatment with TGF-β1 significantly enhanced MSCs-EXO production and elevated the levels of massive miRNAs associated with anti-apoptosis and tissue repair, which were evidently decreased after TGF-β1 plus LY450139 cotreatment. Notable improvement was observed in EpiCs after MSCs-EXO treatment, evidenced by reduced cellular apoptosis, increased cellular proliferation and declined oxidative stress, which were more evident in EpiCs that were treated with EXO derived from TGF-β1-pretreated MSCs. However, application of EXO derived from TGF-β1 plus LY450139-cotreated MSCs reversely enhanced cellular apoptosis, decreased cellular proliferation and anti-oxidants production. Interestingly, LY450139 application in EpiCs after treatment with MSCs-EXO also reversed the declined cellular apoptosis and enhanced oxidative stress induced by TGF-β1 pretreatment. In animal studies, administration of EXO derived from TGF-β1-pretreated MSCs more effectively attenuated biliary IRI through reducing oxidative stress, apoptosis, inflammation and enhancing the expression levels of TGF-β1 and Jagged1/Notch1/SOX9 pathway-related markers, which were reversed after administration of EXO derived from TGF-β1 plus LY450139-cotreated MSCs.Our results provided a vital insight that TGF-β1 pretreatment endowed MSCs-EXO with stronger protective effects to improve biliary IRI via Jagged1/Notch1/SOX9 pathway.","['Biliary', 'Exosome', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Jagged1/Notch1/SOX9 pathway', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'TGF-β1']",2023-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a clinically approved cerebroprotective agent against ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while new formulations that enable improvement of its physicochemical properties and biodistribution are desired. Herein, we report a newly developed API-IL of edaravone (edaravone-IL), in which edaravone is used as an anionic molecule. We investigated the physicochemical properties of edaravone-IL and its therapeutic effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a secondary injury after an ischemic stroke. Among the cationic molecules used for edaravone-IL preparation, the IL prepared with tetrabutylphosphonium cation existed as a liquid at room temperature, and significantly increased the water solubility of edaravone without decreasing its antioxidative activity. Importantly, edaravone-IL formed negatively charged nanoparticles upon suspension in water. Intravenous administration of edaravone-IL showed significantly higher blood circulation time and lower distribution in the kidney compared with edaravone solution. Moreover, edaravone-IL significantly suppressed brain cell damage and motor functional deficits in model rats of cerebral I/R injury and showed comparable cerebroprotective effect to edaravone. Taken together, these results suggest that edaravone-IL could be a new form of edaravone with superior physicochemical properties and could be useful for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury.","['antioxidant', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'cerebroprotective agent', 'edaravone', 'ionic liquid', 'nanoparticles']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37154714,Endothelial FOXC1 and FOXC2 promote intestinal regeneration after ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Intestinal ischemia underlies several clinical conditions and can result in the loss of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Ischemia-induced damage to the intestinal epithelium is repaired by stimulation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and paracrine signaling from the vascular niche regulates intestinal regeneration. Here, we identify FOXC1 and FOXC2 as essential regulators of paracrine signaling in intestinal regeneration after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)- and lymphatic EC (LEC)-specific deletions of Foxc1, Foxc2, or both in mice worsen I/R-induced intestinal damage by causing defects in vascular regrowth, expression of chemokine CXCL12 and Wnt activator R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) in blood ECs (BECs) and LECs, respectively, and activation of Wnt signaling in ISCs. Both FOXC1 and FOXC2 directly bind to regulatory elements of the CXCL12 and RSPO3 loci in BECs and LECs, respectively. Treatment with CXCL12 and RSPO3 rescues the I/R-induced intestinal damage in EC- and LEC-Foxc mutant mice, respectively. This study provides evidence that FOXC1 and FOXC2 are required for intestinal regeneration by stimulating paracrine CXCL12 and Wnt signaling.","['CXCL12', 'Wnt/R-spondin', 'intestinal regeneration', 'ischemia', 'paracrine signaling']",2022-08-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, the dynamic non-invasive mapping of redox homeostasis in deep-seated liver during hepatic I/R injury remains a great challenge. Herein, inspired by the intrinsic reversibility of disulfide bond in proteins, a kind of reversible redox-responsive magnetic nanoparticles (RRMNs) is designed for reversible imaging of both oxidant and antioxidant levels (ONOO-/GSH), based on sulfhydryl coupling/cleaving reaction. We develop a facile strategy to prepare such reversible MRI nanoprobe via one-step surface modification. Owing to the significant change in size during the reversible response, the imaging sensitivity of RRMNs is greatly improved, which enables RRMNs to monitor the tiny change of oxidative stress in liver injury. Notably, such reversible MRI nanoprobe can non-invasively visualize the deep-seated liver tissue slice by slice in living mice. Moreover, this MRI nanoprobe can not only report molecular information about the degree of liver injury but also provide anatomical information about where the pathology occurred.

Additionally, the presence of any ICH is frequently used as (safety) outcome measure in clinical stroke trials that evaluate acute interventions. We assessed the interobserver agreement on the presence of any ICH and the type of ICH according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification on magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with reperfusion therapy.We used 300 magnetic resonance imaging scans including susceptibility-weighted imaging or T2*-weighted gradient echo imaging of ischemic stroke patients within 1 week after reperfusion therapy. Six observers, blinded to clinical characteristics except for suspected location of the infarction, independently rated ICH according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification in random pairs. Percent agreement and Cohen's kappa (κ) were estimated for the presence of any ICH (yes/no), and for agreement on the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification class 1 and 2. For the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification class 1 and 2, weighted κ was estimated to take the degree of disagreement into account.In 297 of 300 scans, the quality of scans was sufficient to score ICH. Observers agreed on the presence or absence of any ICH in 264 of 297 scans (88.9%; κ 0.78 [95% CI, 0.71-0.85]). There was agreement on the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification class 1 and 2 and no ICH in class 1 and 2 in 226 of 297 scans (76.1%; κ 0.63 [95% CI, 0.56-0.69]; weighted κ 0.90 [95% CI, 0.87-0.93]).The presence of any ICH can be reliably scored on magnetic resonance imaging and can, therefore, be used as (safety) outcome measure in clinical stroke trials that evaluate acute interventions. Agreement of ICH types according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification is substantial and disagreements are small.","['interobserver agreement', 'intracranial hemorrhage', 'ischemic stroke', 'magnetic resonance imaging']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37154013,Silencing of ALOX15 reduces ferroptosis and inflammation induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by regulating PHD2/HIF2α signaling pathway.,"To investigate the potential mechanism of arachidonic acid deoxyribozyme 15 (ALOX15) in ferroptosis and inflammation induced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury.The mice and cell models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury were constructed. Western Blot was used to detect the protein expression levels of ALOX15, glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and inflammatory factors (NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18) in brain tissues and cells. Cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK-8 method. LDH assay was used to detect the release of lactate dehydrogenase. TTC staining was used to observe cerebral infarction.In cerebral ischemia-reperfusion mice and cell models, the expression of ALOX15 protein was increased, the expression of GPX4, a key marker of ferroptosis was decreased, and silencing of ALOX15 down-regulated the GPX4 expression. HIF-2α expression was down-regulated in animal and cell models of cerebral ischemia reperfusion, and silencing of ALOX15 increased the HIF-2α expression by inhibiting PHD2 expression. Inhibition of ALOX15 expression reduced inflammatory factors levels (NLRP3, IL-1β, and IL-18) in cerebral ischemia. Inhibitor of PHD2 (IXOC-4) alleviating brain injury and cell death induced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion and stabilize HIF-2α expression in vivo.The expression of ALOX15 was up-regulated in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion animals and cells model. Inhibition of ALOX15 up-regulated the GPX4 expression, and promoted HIF-2α expression by inhibiting PHD2, thus alleviating ferroptosis and inflammation caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.","['ALOX15', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'HIF-2α', 'Inflammation', 'PHD2']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37153779,The effect of triple reuptake inhibitor toludesvenlafaxine on neurological function in cerebral ischemic rats.,"Purpose: The aim is to investigate the effect of toludesvenlafaxine (Tdv), a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, on the neurological function in cerebral ischemic rats and the underlying mechanisms. Material and Methods: Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was induced in rats and the neuroprotective effects of Tdv were evaluated by infarct size, Garcia test, and beam walking test. Neuronal apoptosis in the peri-infarct area was observed by TUNEL staining. And the apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated with Western blotting. The role of CREB pathway in effect of Tdv was also investigated using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results: In the MCAO/R model, administration of Tdv reduced the infarct size, promoted neural functional recovery, decreased the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 and BDNF. In addition, Tdv reduced neuronal apoptosis in the peri-infarct area. Tdv increased the expression of phosphorylated CREB. The application of the specific CREB inhibitor, compound 666-15, could reverse the anti-ischemic cerebral injury of Tdv in MCAO/R rats. Conclusion: Tdv ameliorated cerebral ischemic injury through reducing neuronal apoptosis and increasing the expression of BDNF via the activation of CREB pathway.","['CREB pathway', 'antidepressants', 'cerebral ischemia', 'neuroprotective effects', 'toludesvenlafaxine', 'triple reuptake inhibitor']",2022-10-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37153414,Renoprotective effects of zinc sulfate against transient liver ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.,"Liver ischemia/reperfusion damage frequently occurs in setting of hepatic resection and liver transplantation. It leads to disturbance in remote organs such as heart, lung and kidneys. This study explored the consequences of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion on the oxidative stress parameters, biochemical factors, and histopathological alterations in the kidney's rats, as well as evaluated the role of zinc sulfate on above-mentioned parameters.Twenty-eight male Wistar rats were accidently assigned into four groups (n = 7). They were Sham, ischemia/reperfusion, zinc sulfate pretreatment, and zinc sulfate pretreatment + ischemia/reperfusion groups. Sham group: obtained normal saline (2 ml/day, seven consecutive days), intraperitoneally, zinc sulfate pretreatment group: obtained zinc sulfate (5 mg/kg, seven consecutive days, intraperitoneally). Ischemia/reperfusion group: obtained normal saline as mentioned previous, then rats experienced the partial ischemia (%70) for 45 min followed by 60 min reperfusion. Zinc sulfate pretreatment group: obtained zinc sulfate as mentioned previous, then rats experience the partial ischemia/reperfusion as presented earlier. At the end of investigation, blood was withdrawn, liver and renal tissues were removed. Then, biochemical and oxidative stress parameters, and histological changes were evaluated in the mentioned tissues.The findings of this experiment indicated that zinc sulfate markedly reduced the serum levels of liver and kidney function tests in relative to ischemia/reperfusion group. Also, antioxidant enzymes activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and nitric oxide significantly increased, while malondialdehyde level declined in the renal tissue of zinc sulfate + ischemia/reperfusion group compared to ischemia/reperfusion rats. Furthermore, zinc sulfate alleviated the liver and kidneys histopathological alterations following ischemia/reperfusion.Zinc sulfate ameliorated liver and kidney function, and improved oxidant-antioxidant balance in favor of antioxidants. It is suggested that zinc sulfate may be beneficial effects on hepato-renal injury after ischemia/reperfusion.","['Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Rat', 'Zinc sulfate']",2022-07-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37152604,Physiological ischemic training improves cardiac function through the attenuation of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the activation of the vagus nerve in chronic heart failure.,"This study investigated the functional outcomes of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) after physiological ischemic training (PIT), identified the optimal PIT protocol, evaluated its cardioprotective effects and explored the underlying neural mechanisms.Patients with CHF were randomly divided into experimental group (n = 25, PIT intervention + regular treatment) and control group (n = 25, regular treatment). The outcomes included the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiopulmonary parameters. LVEF and cardiac biomarkers in CHF rats after various PIT treatments (different in intensity, frequency, and course of treatment) were measured to identify the optimal PIT protocol. The effect of PIT on cardiomyocyte programmed cell death was investigated by western blot, flow cytometry and fluorescent staining. The neural mechanism involved in PIT-induced cardioprotective effect was assessed by stimulation of the vagus nerve and muscarinic M2 receptor in CHF rats.LVEF and VO2max increased while BNP decreased in patients subjected to PIT. The optimal PIT protocol in CHF rats was composed of five cycles of 5 min ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion on remote limbs for 8 weeks. LVEF and cardiac biomarker levels were significantly improved, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was inhibited. However, these cardioprotective effects disappeared after subjecting CHF rats to vagotomy or muscarinic M2 receptor inhibition.PIT improved functional outcomes in CHF patients. The optimal PIT protocol required appropriate intensity, reasonable frequency, and adequate treatment course. Under these conditions, improvement of cardiac function in CHF was confirmed through cardiomyocyte apoptosis reduction and vagus nerve activation.","['apoptosis', 'cardiac function', 'chronic heart failure', 'muscarinic M2 receptor', 'physiological ischemic training', 'vagus nerve']",2023-02-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37151220,Cardioprotection of mAb2G4/ODN/lip on Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via Inhibiting the NF-κB Signaling Pathway.,"Substantial evidence suggests that the interventions of NF-κB would likely effectively prevent inflammatory response and reduce myocardial damage in the ischemic myocardium. And the NF-кB decoy ODN is a specific inhibitor that suppresses the expression of NF-κB. Herein, we revealed the effect and possible mechanism of mAb2G4/ODN/lip on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI). As shown in the results, post-treatment with mAb2G4/ODN/lip improved the impaired histological morphology in the MI/RI model and elevated cell viability in the H/R model. The mAb2G4/ODN/lip complex inhibited the NLRP3 signaling pathway and decreased the expression of LDH, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and MDA. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that post-treatment with mAb2G4/ODN/lip exerted protective effects against I/R injuries by inhibiting the NF-кB-related inflammatory response. In summary, the present study may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for treating MI/RI.",[],2022-09-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37150341,Cardiosome-mediated protection in myocardial ischemia.,"Cardiosomes, exosomes released in cardiospheres by cardiomyocytes and progenitor cells, communicate locally and at a distance from different tissues, promoting beneficial cellular changes. For example, miRNAs have emerged as regulators of intercellular communication via transport by extracellular vesicles in general and cardiosomes specifically. Although cardiosomes are considered biomarkers owing to their immense biomedical application in various clinical fields, their role in cardiovascular diseases remains unclear. This mini-review examines the experimental and clinical evidence for cardiosomes as non-invasive diagnostic, treatment and prognostic tools in acute myocardial infarction, the novelty of which is often lost in medical practice.

37150036,The molecular mechanisms of cuproptosis and its relevance to cardiovascular disease.,"Recently, cuproptosis has been demonstrated to be a new non-apototic cell death mode that is characterized by copper dependence and the regulation of mitochondrial respiration. Cuproptosis is distinct from known cell death modes such as apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis, or ferroptosis. Excessive copper induces cuproptosis by promoting protein toxic stress reactions via copper-dependent anomalous oligomerization of lipoylation proteins in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and reducing iron-sulfur cluster protein levels. Ferredoxin1 (FDX1) promotes dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (DLAT) lipoacylation and abates iron-sulfur cluster proteins by reducing Cu2+ to Cu+, inducing cell death. Copper homeostasis depends on the copper transporter, and disturbances to this homeostasis cause cuproptosis. Recent evidence has shown that cuproptosis plays a significant role in the occurrence and development of many cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, heart failure, atherosclerosis, and arrhythmias. Copper chelators, such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate(VI) and DL-Penicillamine, may ease the above cardiovascular diseases by inhibiting the cuproptosis pathway. Oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors may inhibit cuproptosis by inhibiting protein stress response. In conclusion, cuproptosis plays an essential role in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of cardiovascular cuproptosis is expected to become a potential treatment. Here, we will thoroughly review the molecular mechanisms involved in cuproptosis and its significance in cardiovascular disease.","['Cardiovascular disease', 'Copper', 'Cuproptosis', 'Mitochondrion', 'Tricarboxylic acid cycle']",2022-12-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37149986,Ischemia/reperfusion-induced MiD51 upregulation recruits Drp1 to mitochondria and contributes to myocardial injury.,"The translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria leads to Drp1 activation and mitochondrial fission in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). However, the molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial Drp1 translocation remains poorly understood. Mitochondrial Drp1 recruitment relies on 4 binding partners including MiD49, MiD51, Mff and Fis1. This study was to elucidate which one facilitate mitochondrial Drp1 translocation and its role in MI/R injury. MI/R was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min and subsequent reperfusion for 3 h. Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia for 2 h and reoxygenation for 4 h. SiRNA or Adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing shRNA was used to knock down the key binding partner in vitro or in vivo respectively. The expression of MiD51 rather than other binding partners (MiD49, Mff or Fis1) was increased after MI/R. MiD51 knockdown inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced mitochondrial Drp1 translocation. SiRNA-induced knockdown of MiD51 suppressed mitochondrial oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function and alleviate cellular injury in H/R cardiomyocytes. AAV-mediated knockdown of MiD51 reduced myocardial injury and improved cardiac function in the I/R hearts, while mitochondrial Drp1 translocation and cardiac function were not affected by MiD51 knockdown in the hearts without I/R. MiD51 is identified as the binding partner that promotes mitochondrial Drp1 translocation and contributes to MI/R injury. Inhibition of MiD51 may be a potential therapeutic target to alleviate MI/R injury.","['Drp1', 'MiD51', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Mitochondrial fission', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury']",2023-04-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37149940,Fluorescent probes for lighting up ferroptotic cell death: A review.,"Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulated cellular demise, characterized by the accumulation of intracellular oxidative stress that is dependent on iron. Ferroptosis plays a crucial role not only in the development and treatment of tumors but also in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and illnesses related to ischemia-reperfusion injury. This mode of cell death possesses distinctive properties that differentiate it from other forms of cell death, including unique morphological changes at both the cellular and subcellular levels, as well as molecular features that can be detected using specific methods. The use of fluorescent probes has become an invaluable means of detecting ferroptosis, owing to their high sensitivity, real-time in situ monitoring capabilities, and minimal damage to biological samples. This review comprehensively elucidates the physiological mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, while also detailing the development of fluorescent probes capable of detecting ferroptosis-related active species across various cellular compartments, including organelles, the nucleus, and the cell membrane. Additionally, the review explores how the dynamic changes and location of active species from different cellular compartments can influence the ignition and execution of ferroptotic cell death. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and opportunities for imaging ferroptosis. We believe that this review will not only aid in the elucidation of ferroptosis's physiological mechanisms but also facilitate the identification of novel treatment targets and means of accurately diagnosing and treating ferroptosis-related diseases.","['And cell membrane', 'Ferroptosis', 'Fluorescent probe', 'Imaging', 'Nucleus', 'Organelles']",2023-01-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Given the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, skin flaps are prone to several complications, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Numerous attempts have been undertaken to enhance the survival rate of skin flaps entailing pre/post-conditioning with surgical and pharmacological modalities. Various cellular and molecular mechanisms are employed in these approaches in order to reduce inflammation, promote angiogenesis and blood perfusion, and induce apoptosis and autophagy. With the emerging role of multiple stem cell lineages and their ability to improve skin flap viability, these approaches are increasingly being used to develop even more translationally applicable methods. Therefore, this review aims at providing current evidence around pharmacological interventions for improving skin flap survival and discussing their underlying mechanism of action.","['Flap survival', 'Pharmacological intervention', 'Regeneration', 'Skin flap']",2022-12-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37149283,The mechanism of the NFAT transcription factor family involved in oxidative stress response.,"As a transcriptional activator widely expressed in various tissues, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is involved in the regulation of the immune system, the development of the heart and brain systems, and classically mediating pathological processes such as cardiac hypertrophy. Oxidative stress is an imbalance of intracellular redox status, characterized by excessive generation of reactive oxygen species, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium overload, and subsequent lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Oxidative stress occurs during various pathological processes, such as chronic hypoxia, vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype switching, ischemia-reperfusion, and cardiac remodeling. Calcium overload leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, while NFAT can be activated through calcium-calcineurin, which is also the main regulatory mode of NFAT factors. This review focuses on the effects of NFAT transcription factors on reactive oxygen species production, calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, redox reactions, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. We hope to provide a reference for the functions and characteristics of NFAT involved in various stages of oxidative stress as well as related potential targets.","['Calcium overload', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Nuclear factor of activated T cells', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2022-11-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37149277,Resveratrol inhibits autophagy against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through the DJ-1/MEKK1/JNK pathway.,"Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenolic compound found in red wine and grape skins, has attracted significant attention due to its cardioprotective properties. DJ-1, a multifunctional protein that participated in transcription regulation and antioxidant defense, was shown to provide a significant protective impact in cardiac cells treated with ischemia-reperfusion. We created a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model in vivo and in vitro by ligating the left anterior descending branch of rats and subjecting H9c2 cells to anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) to investigate whether RES reduces myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating DJ-1. We discovered that RES dramatically enhanced cardiac function in rats with I/R. Subsequently, we found that RES prevented the rise in autophagy (P62 degradation and LC3-II/LC3-I increase) induced by cardiac ischemia-reperfusion in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the autophagic agonist rapamycin (RAPA) eliminated RES-induced cardioprotective effects. In addition, Further data showed that RES significantly increased the expression of DJ-1 in the myocardium with the treatment of I/R. At the same time, pretreatment with RES reduced phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) stimulated by cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, and Beclin-1 mRNA and protein levels while decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and improving cell viability. However, the lentiviral shDJ-1 and JNK agonist anisomycin disrupted the effects of RES. In summary, RES could inhibit autophagy against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through DJ-1 modulation of the MEKK1/JNK pathway, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiac homeostasis.","['DJ-1', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'MEKK1/JNK pathway', 'Resveratrol']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37149267,Docosahexaenoic acid promotes M2 microglia phenotype via activating PPARγ-mediated ERK/AKT pathway against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"In ischemia-reperfusion stroke, microglia play a dual role in brain injury as well as brain repair, and promoting their switch from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype is considered to be a potential therapeutic strategy. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, but its effect on microglia polarization is unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DHA on rat brain following ischemia-reperfusion injury, and to investigate the mechanism by which DHA regulates microglia polarization. We administered DHA 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily for 3 d following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion model in rats. The protective effects of DHA on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury were detected by TTC staining, HE staining, Nissler staining, and TUNEL staining. Quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of M1 and M2 microglia-associated markers and PPARγ-mediated ERK/AKT signaling pathway proteins. We found that DHA significantly improved brain injury by decreasing the expression of the M1 phenotypic marker (iNOS, CD16) and increasing the expression of the M2 phenotypic marker (Arg-1, CD206). DHA also increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mRNA and protein, increased the expression of the pathway protein AKT, and decreased the expression of ERK1/2. In addition, DHA promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β. However, the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 greatly blocked these beneficial effects. These results suggest that DHA may activate PPARγ to inhibit ERK and activate AKT signaling pathways to regulate microglia polarization, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and promoting neurological recovery to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.","['Cerebral ischemia', 'Docosahexaenoic acid', 'ERK/AKT pathway', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Microglia polarization', 'Neuroinflammation']",2023-03-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37149242,Mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury are attenuated by nandrolone: Role of JAK-STAT3 pathway.,"To investigate the effect of acute treatment with the anabolic steroid (AS) nandrolone decanoate in mitochondrial homeostasis and JAK-STAT3 signaling during the progression of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury (IR).Male Wistar rats (2 months old) were randomly allocated into four experimental groups: Control (CTRL), IR, AS, and AS+AG490. All animals were euthanized 3 days after a single intramuscular injection of nandrolone at 10 mg/kg (AS and AS+AG490 groups) or vehicle (CTRL and IR groups). Baseline mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) α and β were compared between CTRL and AS groups. Isolated hearts were submitted to ex vivo ischemia and reperfusion, except for hearts from the CTRL group. Before the IR protocol, the JAK-STAT3 inhibitor AG490 was perfused in hearts from the AS+AG490 group. Heart samples were collected during reperfusion to investigate the effects on mitochondrial function. Results Antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression was unaffected, whereas the AS group exhibited decreased β- MHC/α-MHC ratio versus the CTRL group. Compared to the IR group, the AS group exhibited better recovery of post-ischemic left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and LV-developed pressure levels, while infarct size significantly decreased. Furthermore, mitochondrial production, transmembrane potential, and swelling were improved, whereas ROS formation was decreased versus the IR group. These effects were prevented by the perfusion of JAK-STAT3 inhibitor AG490.These findings suggest that acute nandrolone treatment can provide cardioprotection by recruiting the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway and mitochondrial preservation.","['Anabolic steroid', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'JAK/STAT', 'Mitochondria']",2023-03-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37148771,Rebamipide protects against experimentally induced intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-promoted liver damage: Impact on SIRT1/β-catenin/FOXO1and NFκB signaling.,"Rebamipide (Reba) is a well-known gastroprotective agent. However, its potential protective efficacy against intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced liver injury remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the modulatory effect of Reba on SIRT1/β-catenin/FOXO1-NFκB signaling cascade. Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups: G1 (sham): rats were subjected to surgical stress without I/R, GII (I/R): rats were subjected to 60 min/4-h I/R, GIII (Reba + I/R): rats received Reba 100 mg/kg/day, p.o. for three weeks, then were subjected to 60 min/4-h I/R, and GIV (Reba + EX527 + I/R): rats received Reba (100 mg/kg/day p.o.) + EX527 (10 mg/kg/day, ip) for three weeks before I/R. Reba pretreatment decreased the serum levels of ALT and AST, improved I/R-induced histological alterations of both intestine and liver, increased hepatic Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) expression/content, β-catenin expression/immunoreactivity, and FOXO1 expression, while suppressed NF-κB p65 expression/protein content. In addition, Reba increased hepatic total antioxidant capacity (TAC), while suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, Reba inhibited BAX expression, while upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Reba exhibited a plausible protective effect against intestinal I/R-mediated liver injury by modulating SIRT1/β-catenin/FOXO1-NFκB signaling mechanisms.","['Intestinal I/R', 'Liver injury', 'Rebamipide', 'SIRT1/β-catenin signaling pathway']",2023-03-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37148714,Calycosin alleviates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by repressing autophagy via STAT3/FOXO3a signaling pathway.,"As a common cerebrovascular disease (CVD) of the elderly, ischemic stroke (IS) is characterized by high disability and mortality. Excessive autophagy induced by IS is implicated in neuronal death, therefore, the inhibition of immoderate autophagy is viewed as a potential therapeutic avenue to treat IS. Calysoin (CA) is a bioactive component of Radix Astragali, which has been widely used to treat CVDs. However, the mechanism of the treatment of IS by CA is still problematic.Based on the result of network pharmacology, whether CA inhibited autophagy by regulating the STAT3/FOXO3a pathway to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) was investigated in vivo and in vitro for the first time.Integrate computational prediction and experimental validation based on network pharmacology.In current study, network pharmacology was applied to predict the mechanism of the treatment of IS by CA, and it was shown that CA alleviated CIRI by inhibiting autophagy via STAT3/FOXO3a signaling pathway. One hundred and twenty adult male specific pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats in vivo and PC12 cells in vitro were used to verify the above prediction results. The rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established by suture method, and oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model was used to simulate cerebral ischemia in vivo. The content of MDA, TNF-α, ROS and TGF-β1 in rat serum were detected by ELISA kits. The mRNA and protein expressions in brain tissue were detected by RT-PCR and Western Blotting. The expressions of LC3 in brain were detected immunofluorescent staining.The experimental results demonstrated that administration of CA dosage-dependently improved rat CIRI as evidenced by the reduction in the cerebral infarct volume, amelioration of the neurological deficits. HE staining and transmission electron microscopy results revealed that CA ameliorated cerebral histopathological damage, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and damaged mitochondrial cristae structure in MCAO/R rats. CA treatment exerted protective effects in CIRI by inhibiting inflammation response, oxidative stress injury, and cell apoptosis in rat and PC12 cells. CA relieved excessive autophagy induced by MCAO/R or OGD/R through downregulating the LC3Ⅱ/LC3Ⅰ ratio and upregulating the SQSTM1 expression. CA treatment also decreased p-STAT3/STAT3 and p-FOXO3a/FOXO3a ratio in the cytoplasm and modulated the autophagy-related gene expression both in vivo and in vitro.Treatment with CA attenuated CIRI by reducing excessive autophagy via STAT3/FOXO3a signal pathway in rat and PC12 cells.","['Autophagy', 'Calycosin', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Network pharmacology', 'STAT3/FOXO3a signal pathway']",2023-02-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37148047,Thrombectomy with or without Bridging Thrombolysis for Anterior Circulation Stroke.,"Currently, there is still no clear consensus on bridging thrombolysis (BT) before mechanical thrombectomy (MT). In this study, we aimed to compare clinical and procedural outcomes and complication rates of BT versus direct mechanical thrombectomy (d-MT) in anterior circulation stroke.A total of 359 consecutive anterior circulation stroke patients who received d-MT or BT in our tertiary stroke center between January 2018 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into two groups as Group d-MT (n = 210) and Group BT (n = 149). The primary outcome was the impact of BT on clinical and procedural outcomes, whereas the secondary outcome was the safety of BT.The incidence of atrial fibrillation was higher in the d-MT group (p = 0.010). The median duration of the procedure was significantly higher in Group d-MT than in Group BT (35 vs 27 min, respectively; P = 0.044). The number of patients achieving good and excellent outcomes was significantly higher in Group BT (p = 0.006 and P = 0.03). The edema/malign infarction rate was higher in the d-MT group (p = 0.003). Successful reperfusion, first-pass effects, symptomatic intra-cranial hemorrhage, and mortality rates were similar between the groups (p > 0.05).In this study, BT seems to yield better clinical and procedural outcomes with lower complication rates than d-MT. These findings may support the additional value of intravenous alteplase in anterior system strokes. Further large-scale, prospective, randomized-controlled studies will clarify the gray lines in this consensus, but this paper is important for reflecting the real-world data in developing countries.","['Acute ischemic stroke', 'bridging thrombolysis', 'mechanical thrombectomy']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37147910,Large animal models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury: Where are we now?,"Large animal models of cardiac ischemia-reperfusion are critical for evaluation of the efficacy of cardioprotective interventions prior to clinical translation. Nonetheless, current cardioprotective strategies/interventions formulated in preclinical cardiovascular research are often limited to small animal models, which are not transferable or reproducible in large animal models due to different factors such as: (i) complex and varied features of human ischemic cardiac disease (ICD), which are challenging to mimic in animal models, (ii) significant differences in surgical techniques applied, and (iii) differences in cardiovascular anatomy and physiology between small versus large animals. This article highlights the advantages and disadvantages of different large animal models of preclinical cardiac ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI), as well as the different methods used to induce and assess IRI, and the obstacles faced in using large animals for translational research in the settings of cardiac IR.在临床转化为人体试验之前，心脏缺血-再灌注的大型动物模型对于评估心脏保护干预措施的效果至关重要。然而，现有的心脏保护策略/干预方法往往仅限于小型动物模型，由于不同的因素，这些方法无法转移到大型动物模型中重现，原因有：(i) 人类缺血性心脏病 (ICD) 的复杂多样的特征难以在动物模型中准确模拟。(ii) 目前所应用的外科手术技术存在显着差异。 (iii) 小型动物与大型动物在心血管解剖学和生理学方面存在差异。该文重点介绍了不同大型动物模型在前临床实验中心脏缺血再灌注损伤 (IRI) 的一些优点/缺点、用于诱导和评估 IRI 的不同方法，以及在利用这些大型动物进行转化研究时面临的障碍和挑战。.","['Cardiovascular disorder', 'Ischemic cardiac disease', 'Ischemic-reperfusion injury', 'Large animal model', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Translational gap']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37147443,Multilineage contribution of CD34+ cells in cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"The ambiguous results of multiple CD34+ cell-based therapeutic trials for patients with heart disease have halted the large-scale application of stem/progenitor cell treatment. This study aimed to delineate the biological functions of heterogenous CD34+ cell populations and investigate the net effect of CD34+ cell intervention on cardiac remodeling. We confirmed, by combining single-cell RNA sequencing on human and mouse ischemic hearts and an inducible Cd34 lineage-tracing mouse model, that Cd34+ cells mainly contributed to the commitment of mesenchymal cells, endothelial cells (ECs), and monocytes/macrophages during heart remodeling with distinct pathological functions. The Cd34+-lineage-activated mesenchymal cells were responsible for cardiac fibrosis, while CD34+Sca-1high was an active precursor and intercellular player that facilitated Cd34+-lineage angiogenic EC-induced postinjury vessel development. We found through bone marrow transplantation that bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells only accounted for inflammatory response. We confirmed using a Cd34-CreERT2; R26-DTA mouse model that the depletion of Cd34+ cells could alleviate the severity of ventricular fibrosis after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury with improved cardiac function. This study provided a transcriptional and cellular landscape of CD34+ cells in normal and ischemic hearts and illustrated that the heterogeneous population of Cd34+ cell-derived cells served as crucial contributors to cardiac remodeling and function after the I/R injury, with their capacity to generate diverse cellular lineages.","['Endothelial cell', 'Macrophage', 'Mesenchymal cell', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing']",2022-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37147193,Combination of Cold Storage in a Heavy Water-Containing Solution and Post-Reperfusion Hydrogen Gas Treatment Reduces Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rat Livers.,"We previously reported the efficacy of cold storage (CS) using a heavy water-containing solution (Dsol) and post-reperfusion hydrogen gas treatment separately. This study aimed to clarify the combined effects of these treatments. Rat livers were subjected to 48-hour CS and a subsequent 90-minute reperfusion in an isolated perfused rat liver system. The experimental groups were the immediately reperfused control group (CT), the CS with University of Wisconsin solution (UW) group, the CS with Dsol group, the CS with UW and post-reperfusion H2 treatment group (UW-H2), and the CS with Dsol and post-reperfusion H2 group (Dsol-H2). We first compared the Dsol-H2, UW, and CT groups to evaluate this alternative method to conventional CS. The protective potential of the Dsol-H2 group was superior to that of the UW group, as evidenced by lower portal venous resistance and lactate dehydrogenase leakage, a higher oxygen consumption rate, and increased bile production. Multiple comparison tests among the UW, Dsol, UW-H2, and Dsol-H2 groups revealed that both treatments, during CS and after reperfusion, conferred a similar extent of protection and showed additive effects in combination therapy. Furthermore, the variance in all treatment groups appeared smaller than that in the no-treatment or no-stress groups, with excellent reproducibility. In conclusion, combination therapy with Dsol during CS and hydrogen gas after reperfusion additively protects against graft injury.",[],2023-03-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37146842,The combination of Alisma and Atractylodes ameliorates cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury by negatively regulating astrocyte-derived exosomal miR-200a-3p/141-3p by targeting SIRT1.,"The combination of Alisma and Atractylodes (AA), a classical traditional Chinese herbal decoction, may protect against cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, the underlying mechanism has not been characterized. Intriguingly, exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) have been recognized as vital factors in the pharmacology of Chinese herbal decoctions.The aim of the present study was to assess whether the neuroprotective effect of AA was dependent on the efficient transfer of miRNAs via exosomes in the brain.Bilateral common carotid artery ligation (BCAL) was used to induce transient global cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (GCI/R) in C57BL/6 mice treated with/without AA. Neurological deficits were assessed with the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Western blot (WB) analysis was used to detect the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the cerebral cortex. The inflammatory state was quantitatively evaluated by measuring the expression of phospho-Nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) using WB analysis and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemical staining. The protein expression of zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), occludin, caudin-5 and CD31 was examined by immunohistochemical staining to determine blood‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Exosomes were extracted from the brain interstitial space by ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), WB analysis and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The origin of exosomes was clarified by measuring the specific mRNAs within exosomes via Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT‒qPCR). Differential miRNAs in exosomes were identified using microarray screening and were validated by RT‒qPCR. Exosomes were labelled with fluorescent dye (PKH26) and incubated with bEnd.3 cells, the supernatant was collected, IL-1β/TNF-α expression was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), total RNA was extracted, and miR-200a-3p/141-3p expression was examined by RT‒qPCR. In addition, the levels of miR-200a-3p/141-3p in oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced bEnd.3 cells were quantified. The direct interaction between miR-200a-3p/141-3p and the SIRT1 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) was measured by determining SIRT1 expression in bEnd.3 cells transfected with the miR-200a-3p/141-3p mimic/inhibitor.Severe neurological deficits and memory loss caused by GCI/R in mice was markedly ameliorated by AA treatment, particularly in the AA medium-dose group. Moreover, AA-treated GCI/R-induced mice showed significant increases in SIRT1, ZO-1, occludin, caudin-5, and CD31 expression levels and decreases in p-NF-κB, IL-1β, TNF-α, and GFAP expression levels compared with those in untreated GCI/R-induced mice. Furthermore, we found that miR-200a-3p/141-3p was enriched in astrocyte-derived exosomes from GCI/R-induced mice and could be inhibited by treatment with a medium dose of AA. The exosomes mediated the transfer of miR-200a-3p/141-3p into bEnd.3 cells, promoted IL-1β and TNF-α release and downregulated the expression of SIRT1. No significant changes in the levels of miR-200a-3p/141-3p were observed in OGD/R-induced bEnd.3 cells. The miR-200a-3p/141-3p mimic/inhibitor decreased/increased SIRT1 expression in bEnd.3 cells, respectively.Our findings demonstrated that AA attenuated inflammation-mediated CIRI by inhibiting astrocyte-derived exosomal miR-200a-3p/141-3p by targeting the SIRT1 gene, which provided further evidence and identified a novel regulatory mechanism for the neuroprotective effects of AA.","['Alisma and atractylodes', 'Cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury', 'Exosomal miR-200a-3p/141-3p', 'SIRT1']",2023-02-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37146721,Ramelteon improves blood-brain barrier of focal cerebral ischemia rats to prevent post-stroke depression via upregulating occludin.,"Post-stroke depression (PSD) negatively affects the prognosis of post-stroke animals. Ramelteon has neuroprotection for chronic ischemia animals, but the effect and the biological mechanism of it on PSD is still unclear. This study explored the effects of ramelteon with prophylactic administration on blood-brain barrier in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) bEnd.3 cells and found that ramelteon pretreatment improved the depressive-like behaviors and decreased infarct area in MCAO rats. Also, this study found ramelteon pretreatment improved viability and inhibited permeability in OGD/R cells. In addition, this study found that MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-1 levels were raised in the MCAO rats and that occludin protein and mRNA levels were decreased in the MCAO and the OGD/R models, while the Egr-1 level was up-regulated. All of these were antagonized by ramelteon pretreatment. In addition, overexpression of Egr-1 could reverse the effect of 100 nM ramelteon pretreatment on FITC and occludin levels in OGD/R cells. In short, this study has demonstrated that the protective effect on PSD of ramelteon pretreatment on MCAO rats is related to the development of BBB permeability and that ramelteon regulates occludin to protect the BBB by inhibiting Egr-1.","['Blood-brain barrier', 'Depression', 'Egr-1', 'Occludin', 'Ramelteon', 'The middle cerebral artery occlusion']",2022-11-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37146710,Inhibition of MALT1 reduces ferroptosis in rat hearts following ischemia/reperfusion via enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway.,"The dysregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and/or solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) is believed to contribute to ferroptosis in the hearts suffered ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but the mechanisms behind the dysregulation of them are not fully elucidated. Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) can function as a paracaspase to cleave specified substrates and it is predicted to interact with Nrf2. This study aims to explore whether targeting MALT1 can reduce I/R-induced ferroptosis via enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway. The SD rat hearts were subjected to 1h-ischemia plus 3h-reperfusion to establish the I/R injury model, which showed myocardial injuries (increase in infarct size and creatine kinase release) and up-regulation of MALT1 while downregulation of Nrf2 and SLC7A11 concomitant with the increased ferroptosis, reflecting by an increase in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) level while decreases in the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), total iron, Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation (LPO); these phenomena were reversed in the presence of MI-2, a specific inhibitor of MALT1. Consistently, similar results were achieved in the cultured cardiomyocytes subjected to 8h-hypoxia plus 12h-reoxygenation. Furthermore, micafungin, an antifungal drug, could also exert beneficial effect on mitigating myocardial I/R injury via inhibition of MALT1. Based on these observations, we conclud that inhibition of MALT1 can reduce I/R-induced myocardial ferroptosis through enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway; and MALT1 may be used as a potential target to seek novel or existing drugs (such as micafungin) for treating myocardial infarction.","['Ferroptosis', 'MALT1', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'Nrf2', 'SLC7A11']",2023-01-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37146415,Nobiletin alleviates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via ferroptosis in rats with type-2 diabetes mellitus.,"Susceptibility to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) remains disputed, although studies have reported that ferroptosis is associated with myocardial IR injury. Nobiletin, a flavonoid isolated from citrus peels, is an antioxidant that possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. However, it remains unknown whether nobiletin has any protective effects on susceptibility to myocardial IR injury during T2DM in rats via ferroptosis. To investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of nobiletin on myocardial IR injury during T2DM, we induced myocardial IR model in rats at T2DM onset vs mature disease. We also established a high-fat high-glucose (HFHG) and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model in H9c2 cells to imitate abnormal glycolipid metabolism during T2DM. Myocardial injury, oxidative stress and ferroptosis towards myocardial IR in rats with mature T2DM but not at T2DM onset were increased. These changes were restored under treatment with ferrostain-1 or nobiletin. Both ferrostain-1 and nobiletin decreased the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins including Acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) but not glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in rats with mature T2DM and cells with HFHG and H/R injury. Nobiletin strengthened the effect of si-ACSL4 on inhibiting ACSL4 expression, and also inhibited the effect of Erastin or oe-ACSL4 on increasing ACSL4 expression. Taken together, our data indicates that ferroptosis involves in susceptibility to myocardial IR injury in rats during T2DM. Nobiletin has therapeutic potential for alleviating myocardial IR injury associated with ACSL4- and NCOA4-related ferroptosis.","['Ferroptosis', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Nobiletin', 'Susceptibility', 'Type-2 diabetes']",2023-03-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37145970,Dexmedetomidine Pretreatment Protects Against Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Activating STAT3 Signaling.,"Myocardial infarction is a common perioperative complication, and blood flow restoration causes ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Dexmedetomidine (DEX) pretreatment can protect against cardiac IRI, but the mechanism is still insufficiently understood.In vivo, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (30 minutes/120 minutes) was induced via ligation and then reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in mice. Intravenous infusion of 10 μg/kg DEX was performed 20 minutes before ligation. Moreover, the α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist Yohimbine and STAT3 inhibitor Stattic were applied 30 minutes ahead of DEX infusion. In vitro, hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) with DEX pretreatment for 1 hour was performed in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In addition, Stattic was applied before DEX pretreatment.In the mouse cardiac ischemia/reperfusion model, DEX pretreatment lowered the serum creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) levels (2.47 ± 0.165 vs 1.55 ± 0.183; P < .0001), downregulated the inflammatory response (P ≤ .0303), decreased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) production and cell apoptosis (P = .0074), and promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3 (4.94 ± 0.690 vs 6.68 ± 0.710, P = .0001), which could be blunted by Yohimbine and Stattic. The bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs further confirmed that STAT3 signaling might be involved in the cardioprotection of DEX. Upon H/R treatment in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, 5 μM DEX pretreatment improved cell viability (P = .0005), inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and calcium overload (both P ≤ .0040), decreased cell apoptosis (P = .0470), and promoted STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 (0.102 ± 0.0224 vs 0.297 ± 0.0937; P < .0001) and Ser727 (0.586 ± 0.177 vs 0.886 ± 0.0546; P = .0157), which could be abolished by Stattic.DEX pretreatment protects against myocardial IRI, presumably by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation via the α2-adrenoreceptor in vivo and in vitro.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37145937,The effect of electrical stimulation of skeletal muscle on cardioprotection and on muscle-derived myokine levels in rats: A pilot study.,"Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is a widely used method in sports and rehabilitation therapies to simulate physical exercise. EMS treatment via skeletal muscle activity improves the cardiovascular functions and the overall physical condition of the patients. However, the cardioprotective effect of EMS has not been proven so far, therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential cardiac conditioning effect of EMS in an animal model. Low-frequency 35-min EMS was applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of male Wistar rats for three consecutive days. Their isolated hearts were then subjected to 30 min global ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. At the end of reperfusion cardiac specific creatine kinase (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme release and myocardial infarct size were determined. Additionally, skeletal muscle-driven myokine expression and release were also assessed. Phosphorylation of cardioprotective signaling pathway members AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 proteins were also measured. EMS significantly attenuated cardiac LDH and CK-MB enzyme activities in the coronary effluents at the end of the ex vivo reperfusion. EMS treatment considerably altered the myokine content of the stimulated gastrocnemius muscle without altering circulating myokine levels in the serum. Additionally, phosphorylation of cardiac AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 was not significantly different in the two groups. Despite the lack of significant infarct size reduction, the EMS treatment seems to influence the course of cellular damage due to ischemia/reperfusion and favorably modifies skeletal muscle myokine expressions. Our results suggest that EMS may have a protective effect on the myocardium, however, further optimization is required.","['cardioprotection', 'electrical muscle stimulation', 'heart', 'myokine', 'reperfusion injury']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37144844,Upregulation of P2X7 Exacerbates Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury through Enhancing Inflammation and Apoptosis in Diabetic Mice.,"Diabetes-aggravated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury remains an urgent medical issue, and the molecular mechanisms involved with diabetes and MI/R injury remain largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that inflammation and P2X7 signaling participate in the pathogenesis of the heart under individual conditions. It remains to be explored if P2X7 signaling is exacerbated or alleviated under double insults. We established a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model, and we compared the differences in immune cell infiltration and P2X7 expression between diabetic and nondiabetic mice after 24 h of reperfusion. The antagonist and agonist of P2X7 were administered before and after MI/R. Our study showed that the MI/R injury of diabetic mice was characterized by increased infarct area, impaired ventricular contractility, more apoptosis, aggravated immune cell infiltration, and overactive P2X7 signaling compared with nondiabetic mice. The major trigger of increased P2X7 was the MI/R-induced recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, and diabetes can be a synergistic factor in this process. Administration of P2X7 agonist eliminated the differences in MI/R injury between nondiabetic mice and diabetic mice. Both 2 wk of brilliant blue G injection before MI/R and acutely administered A438079 at the time of MI/R injury attenuated the role of diabetes in exacerbating MI/R injury, as evidenced by decreased infarct size, improved cardiac function, and inhibition of apoptosis. Additionally, brilliant blue G blockade decreased the heart rate after MI/R, which was accompanied by downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression and nerve growth factor transcription. In conclusion, targeting P2X7 may be a promising strategy for reducing the risk of MI/R injury in diabetes.",[],2022-11-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37144215,A molecular network-based pharmacological study on the protective effect of Panax notoginseng rhizomes against renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Objective: We aimed to explore the protective effect of Panax notoginseng rhizomes (PNR) on renal ischemia and reperfusion injury (RIRI) and the underlying molecular network mechanism based on network pharmacology and combined systemic experimental validation. Methods: A bilateral RIRI model was established, and Cr, SCr, and BUN levels were detected. Then, the PNR was pretreated 1 week before the RIRI model was prepared. To determine the effects of the PNR in RIRI, histopathological damage and the effect of PNRs to the kidney was assessed, using TTC, HE, and TUNEL staining. Furthermore, the underlying network pharmacology mechanism was detected by screening drug-disease intersection targets from PPI protein interactions and GO and KEGG analysis, and the hub genes were screened for molecular docking based on the Degree value. Finally, the expression of hub genes in kidney tissues was verified by qPCR, and the protein expression of related genes was further detected by Western blot (WB). Results: PNR pretreatment could effectively increase Cr level, decrease SCr and BUN levels, reduce renal infarct areas and renal tubular cell injury areas, and inhibit renal cell apoptosis. By using network pharmacology combined with bioinformatics, we screened co-targets both Panax notoginseng (Sanchi) and RIRI, acquired ten hub genes, and successfully performed molecular docking. Of these, pretreatment with the PNR reduced the mRNA levels of IL6 and MMP9 at postoperative day 1 and TP53 at postoperative day 7, and the protein expression of MMP9 at postoperative day 1 in IRI rats. These results showed that the PNR could decrease kidney pathological injury in IRI rats and inhibit apoptotic reaction and cell inflammation so as to improve renal injury effectively, and the core network mechanism is involved in the inhibition of MMP9, TP53, and IL-6. Conclusion: The PNR has a marked protective effect for RIRI, and the underlying mechanism is involved in inhibiting the expression of MMP9, TP53, and IL-6. This striking discovery not only provides fruitful evidence for the protective effect of the PNR in RIRI rats but also provides a novel mechanic explanation.","['Panax notoginseng rhizomes', 'apoptosis', 'inflammatory response', 'network pharmacology', 'renal ischemia–reperfusion injury']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37143406,"Exercise preconditioning attenuates cerebral ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis, Th17/Treg imbalance, and inflammation in rats by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.","Exercise preconditioning (EP) is essential for preventing ischemic stroke. Recent studies have shown that EP exerts neuroprotective effects in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Nonetheless, there have been few reports on the relationship between EP and the Th17/Treg balance. Moreover, it is unclear whether the JAK2/STAT3 pathway is responsible for the neuroprotective effect of EP. Therefore, we aimed to explore the impact of EP, other than the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic functions, on the Th17/Treg balance via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced model.Fifty rats were randomly allocated into five groups, including the sham group (n = 10), EP+sham group (n = 10), MCAO group (n = 10), EP+MCAO group (n = 10), and EP+MCAO+JAK2/STAT3 pathway agonist (coumermycin A1, CA1) group (n = 10). The results indicated that EP alleviated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, and ameliorated neuronal apoptosis induced by MCAO. Additionally, the MCAO-induced Th17/Treg imbalance could be rectified by EP. The decreased levels of IL-10 and Foxp3 and increased IL-17 and RORα in the MCAO group were reversed by EP treatment. Regarding inflammation, EP reduced the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-17 and elevated those of IL-10 and TGF-β. The neuroprotective effects of EP were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Furthermore, CA1 pretreatment diminished all the beneficial effects of EP partially.Our findings suggest that EP contributes to attenuating neuronal apoptosis, Th17/Treg imbalance, and inflammation induced by MCAO via inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, indicating its therapeutic potential in ischemic stroke.","['JAK2/STAT3 pathway', 'Th17/Treg balance', 'cerebral ischemia', 'exercise preconditioning']",2022-11-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37143143,Propofol inhibits myocardial injury induced by microvesicles derived from hypoxia-reoxygenated endothelial cells via lncCCT4-2/CCT4 signaling.,"Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) induces increased release of extracellular vesicles in the heart and exacerbates myocardial IR injury. We have previously shown that propofol attenuates hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR)-induced injury in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and that microvesicles derived from propofol-treated HUVECs inhibit oxidative stress in endothelial cells. However, the role of microvesicles derived from propofol post-treated HUVECs ((HR + P)-EMVs) in IR-injured cardiomyocytes is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of (HR + P)-EMVs in cardiac IR injury compared to microvesicles derived from hypoxic/reoxygenated HUVECs (HR-EMVs) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) models of HUVECs and AC16 cells and a mouse cardiac IR model were established. Microvesicles from HR-injured HUVECs, DMSO post-treated HUVECs and propofol post-treated HUVECs were extracted by ultra-high speed centrifugation, respectively. The above EMVs were co-cultured with HR-injured AC16 cells or injected intracardially into IR mice. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were used to determine the levels of oxidative stress and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Apoptosis related proteins were detected by Western blot. Echocardiography for cardiac function and Evans blue-TTC staining for myocardial infarct size. Expression of lncCCT4-2 in EMVs and AC16 cells was analysed by whole transcriptome sequencing of EMVs and RT-qPCR. The molecular mechanism of inhibition of myocardial injury by (HR + P)-EMVs was elucidated by lentiviral knockdown of lncCCT4-2, plasmid overexpression or knockdown of CCT4, and actinomycin D assay.In vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that HR-EMVs exacerbated oxidative stress and apoptosis in IR-injured cardiomyocytes, leading to increased infarct size and worsened cardiac function. Notably, (HR + P)-EMVs induced significantly less oxidative stress and apoptosis in IR-injured cardiomyocytes compared to HR-EMVs. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing of EMVs and RT-qPCR showed that lncCCT4-2 was significantly upregulated in (HR + P)-EMVs and cardiomyocytes co-cultured with (HR + P)-EMVs. Reduction of lncCCT4-2 in (HR + P)-EMVs enhanced oxidative stress and apoptosis in IR-injured cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic activity of lncCCT4-2 from (HR + P)-EMVs was achieved by increasing the stability of CCT4 mRNA and promoting the expression of CCT4 protein in cardiomyocytes.Our study showed that (HR + P)-EMVs uptake by IR-injured cardiomyocytes upregulated lncCCT4-2 in cardiomyocytes and promoted CCT4 expression, thereby inhibiting HR-EMVs induced oxidative stress and apoptosis.","['Apoptosis', 'Cardiomyocyte', 'Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs)', 'Ischemia-reperfusion (IR)', 'Oxidative stress', 'Propofol', 'lncCCT4-2']",2022-12-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37143086,Comparison of therapeutic effects of mesenchymal stem cells derived from superficial and deep subcutaneous adipose tissues.,"Fibrosis is a common histological feature in the process from chronic organ injury to organ failure. Chronic tissue injury causes inflammatory cell infiltration into the injured tissue. The persistence of this inflammatory cell infiltration leads to fibrosis and organ failure. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) have received much attention as a regenerative therapeutic tool to prevent progression from organ injury to failure. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue is divided into superficial and deep layers by a superficial fascia. Adipose tissue easily collected by liposuction is usually obtained from a deep layer, so ASCs derived from a deep layer are generally used for regenerative medicine. However, no research has been conducted to investigate differences in the therapeutic effects of ASCs from the superficial and deep layers (Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs, respectively). Therefore, we compared the therapeutic potencies of Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs.ASCs were isolated from superficial and deep subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissues collected from patients who underwent breast reconstruction. We first compared cell characteristics, such as morphology, cell proliferation, cell surface markers, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, cell senescence markers, and expression of coagulation and anticoagulant factors between Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs. Furthermore, we compared their ability to promote polarization of M2 macrophages and to inhibit transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad signaling using THP-1 cells and TGF-β1 stimulated HK-2 cells incubated with conditioned media from Sup-ASCs or Deep-ASCs. In in vivo experiments, after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) procedure, Sup-ASCs or Deep-ASCs were injected through the abdominal aorta. At 21 days post-injection, the rats were sacrificed and their left kidneys were collected to evaluate fibrosis. Finally, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis of Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs.Sup-ASCs had greater proliferation and adipogenic differentiation compared with Deep-ASCs, whereas both ASC types had similar morphology, cell surface markers, senescence markers, and expression of coagulation and anticoagulant factors. Conditioned media from Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs equally promoted polarization of M2 macrophages and suppressed TGF-β/Smad signaling. Moreover, administration of Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs equally ameliorated renal fibrosis induced by IRI in rats. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed no significant difference in the expression of genes involved in anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects between Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs.These results indicate that both Sup-ASCs and Deep-ASCs can be used effectively and safely as an intravascular ASC therapy for organ injury.","['Deep subcutaneous adipose tissue', 'Intravascular mesenchymal stem cell therapy', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue']",2022-09-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37142391,Alleviating early demyelination in ischaemia/reperfusion by inhibiting sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 could protect visual function from impairment.,"Retinal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common cause of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis and axonal degeneration, resulting in irreversible visual impairment. However, there are no available neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies for retinal I/R injury, and more effective therapeutic approaches are needed. The role of the myelin sheath of the optic nerve after retinal I/R remains unknown. Here, we report that demyelination of the optic nerve is an early pathological feature of retinal I/R and identify sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a therapeutic target for alleviating demyelination in a model of retinal I/R caused by rapid changes in intraocular pressure. Targeting the myelin sheath via S1PR2 protected RGCs and visual function. In our experiment, we observed early damage to the myelin sheath and persistent demyelination accompanied by S1PR2 overexpression after injury. Blockade of S1PR2 by the pharmacological inhibitor JTE-013 reversed demyelination, increased the number of oligodendrocytes, and inhibited microglial activation, contributing to the survival of RGCs and alleviating axonal damage. Finally, we evaluated the postoperative recovery of visual function by recording visual evoked potentials and assessing the quantitative optomotor response.

37142295,miRNA155-5P participated in DDX3X targeted regulation of pyroptosis to attenuate renal ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) induced pathological damage to renal microvessels and tubular epithelial cells through multiple factors. However, studies investigated whether miRNA155-5P targeted DDX3X to attenuate pyroptosis were scarce.The expression of pyroptosis-related proteins (caspase-1, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and IL-18) were up-regulated in the IRI group. Additionally, miR-155-5p was higher in the IRI group comparing with the sham group. The DDX3X was inhibited by the miR-155-5p mimic more than in the other groups. DEAD-box Helicase 3 X-Linked (DDX3X), NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, LDH, and pyroptosis rates were higher in all H/R groups than in the control group. These indicators were higher in the miR-155-5p mimic group than in the H/R and the miR-155-5p mimic negative control (NC) group.Current findings suggested that miR-155-5p decreased the inflammation involved in pyroptosis by downregulating the DDX3X/NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway.Using the models of IRI in mouse and the hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-induced injury in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells), we analyzed the changes in renal pathology and the expression of factors correlated with pyroptosis and DDX3X. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected miRNAs and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect lactic dehydrogenase activity. The StarBase and luciferase assays examined the specific interplay of DDX3X and miRNA155-5P. In the IRI group, severe renal tissue damage, swelling, and inflammation were examined.","['DDX3X', 'NLRP3', 'caspase-1', 'miR-155-5p', 'pyroptosis']",2023-02-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37141734,Abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is a common condition in cardiovascular diseases, and the mechanism of its occurrence involves multiple complex metabolic pathways and signaling pathways. Among these pathways, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism play important roles in regulating myocardial energy metabolism. Therefore, this article focuses on the roles of glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, including glycolysis, glucose uptake and transport, glycogen metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway; and triglyceride metabolism, fatty acid uptake and transport, phospholipid metabolism, lipoprotein metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, due to the different alterations and development of glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, there are also complex interregulatory relationships between them. In the future, modulating the equilibrium between glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in cardiomyocytes and ameliorating aberrations in myocardial energy metabolism represent highly promising novel strategies for addressing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, a comprehensive exploration of glycolipid metabolism can offer novel theoretical and clinical insights into the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.","['Glucose metabolism', 'Ischemic myocardial disease', 'Lipid metabolism', 'Metabolism', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion']",2023-03-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37141733,Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases: From mechanisms to therapy.,"Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) remain an intractable problem and have high morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as substantial health and economic burdens, representing an urgent clinical need. In recent years, the focus of research has shifted from the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for transplantation to the use of their secretory exosomes (MSC-exosomes) for the treatment of numerous CVDs, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), aneurysm, and stroke. MSCs are pluripotent stem cells with multiple differentiation pathways that exert pleiotropic effects by producing soluble factors, the most effective components of which are exosomes. MSC-exosomes are considered to be an excellent and promising cell-free therapy for CVDs due to their higher circulating stability, improved biocompatibility, reduced toxicity, and immunogenicity. In addition, exosomes play critical roles in repairing CVDs by inhibiting apoptosis, regulating inflammation, ameliorating cardiac remodeling, and promoting angiogenesis. Herein, we describe knowledge about the biological characteristics of MSC-exosomes, investigate the mechanism by which MSC-exosomes mediate therapeutic repair, and summarize recent advances in the efficacy of MSC-exosomes in CVDs, with a view toward future clinical applications.","['Cardiovascular disease', 'Cerebrovascular disease', 'Exosomes', 'Mesenchymal stem cells']",2023-03-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37141237,Assessment of remote ischemic conditioning delivery with optical sensor in acute ischemic stroke: Randomised clinical trial protocol.,"Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is delivered by a blood pressure cuff over the limb, raising pressure 50 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure, to a maximum of 200 mmHg. The cuff is inflated for five minutes and then deflated for five minutes in a sequential ischemia-reperfusion cycle 4-5 times per session. Elevated pressure in the limb may be associated with discomfort and consequently reduced compliance. Continuous assessment of relative blood concentration and oxygenation with a tissue reflectance spectroscopy (a type of optical sensor device) placed over the forearm during the RIC sessions of the arm will allow us to observe the effect of inflation and deflation of the pressure cuff. We hypothesize, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and small vessel disease, RIC delivered together with a tissue reflectance sensor will be feasible.The study is a prospective, single-center, randomized control trial testing the feasibility of the device. Patients with AIS within 7 days from symptoms onset; who also have small vessel disease will be randomized 2:1 to intervention or sham control arms. All patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive 5 cycles of ischemia/reperfusion in the non-paralyzed upper limb with a tissue reflectance sensor and patients in the sham control arm will receive pressure by keeping the cuff pressure at 30 mmHg for 5 minutes. A total of 51 patients will be randomized, 17 in the sham control arm and 34 in the intervention arm. The primary outcome measure will be the feasibility of RIC delivered for 7 days or at the time of discharge. The secondary device-related outcome measures are fidelity of RIC delivery and the completion rate of intervention. The secondary clinical outcome includes a modified Rankin scale, recurrent stroke and cognitive assessment at 90 days.RIC delivery together with a tissue reflectance sensor will allow insight into the blood concentration and blood oxygenation changes in the skin. This will allow individualized delivery of the RIC and improve compliance.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05408130, June 7, 2022.",[],2023-03-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37141234,Symmetric collateral pattern on CTA predicts favorable outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion stroke.,"Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has revolutionized large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke management, but often requires advanced imaging. The collateral pattern on CT angiograms may be an alternative because a symmetric collateral pattern correlates with a slowly growing, small ischemic core. We tested the hypothesis that such patients will have favorable outcomes after EVT. Consecutive patients (n = 74) with anterior LVOs who underwent EVT were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were available CTA and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS). CTA collateral patterns were symmetric in 36%, malignant in 24%, or other in 39%. Median NIHSS was 11 for symmetric, 18 for malignant, and 19 for other (p = 0.02). Ninety-day mRS ≤2, indicating independent living, was achieved in 67% of symmetric, 17% of malignant, and 38% of other patterns (p = 0.003). A symmetric collateral pattern was a significant determinant of 90-day mRS ≤2 (aOR = 6.62, 95%CI = 2.24,19.53; p = 0.001) in a multivariable model that included age, NIHSS, baseline mRS, thrombolysis, LVO location, and successful reperfusion. We conclude that a symmetric collateral pattern predicts favorable outcomes after EVT for LVO stroke. Because the pattern also marks slow ischemic core growth, patients with symmetric collaterals may be suitable for transfer for thrombectomy. A malignant collateral pattern is associated with poor clinical outcomes.",[],2022-12-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This study aimed to determine the potential nephroprotective characteristics of dexmedetomidine (DMD) for the establishment of a standard therapeutic method for AKI.Thirty Spraque Dawley rats were allocated to 4 groups: control, sham, ischemia-reperfusion, and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)+dexmedatomidine.Necrotic tubules, degenerative Bowman's capsule and vascular congestion were observed in the I/R group. In addition, there was an increase in tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 levels in tubular epithelial cells. In contrast, we observed decreased tubular necrosis, IL-1, IL-6 and MDA levels in the DMD treatment group.DMD has a nephroprotective effect against acute kidney injury resulting from I/R, which is related to aortic occlusion used in the treatment of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37140285,Synergistic effects of electroacupuncture and bone marrow stromal cells transplantation therapy in ischemic stroke.,"Animal studies and clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of a combination of transplanted bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in improving neurological deficits. However, the ability of the BMSC-EA treatment to enhance brain repair processes or the neuronal plasticity of BMSC in ischemic stroke model is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects and neuronal plasticity of BMSC transplantation combined with EA in ischemic stroke.A male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. Intracerebral transplantation of BMSC, transfected with lentiviral vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), was performed using a stereotactic apparatus after modeling. MCAO rats were treated with BMSC injection alone or in combination with EA. After the treatment, proliferation and migration of BMSC were observed in different groups by fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine changes in the levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and nestin in the injured striatum.Epifluorescence microscopy revealed that most BMSC in the cerebrum were lysed; few transplanted BMSC survived, and some living cells migrated to areas around the lesion site. NSE was overexpressed in the striatum of MCAO rats, illustrating the neurological deficits caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. The combination of BMSC transplantation and EA attenuated the expression of NSE, indicating nerve injury repair. Although the qRT-PCR results showed that BMSC-EA treatment elevated nestin RNA expression, less robust responses were observed in other tests.Our results show that the combination treatment significantly improved restoration of neurological deficits in the animal stroke model. However, further studies are required to see if EA could promote the rapid differentiation of BMSC into neural stem cells in the short term.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37140018,Effects of heat shock protein 90 on complement activation in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury after pioglitazone preconditioning.,"Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) appears to have a pivotal function in ischemic preconditioning. Pioglitazone preconditioning (PioC) attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries.The current study aims to investigate the role of HSP90, complement C3 and C5a, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) in PioC-induced cardioprotection.A total of 80 rats were randomly categorized into 4 groups, as follows: sham, I/R, PioC, and PioC+HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (PioC+GA). The sham group rats had a thoracotomy, in which the ligature was passed by the heart with no ligation (150 min). The other 3 groups were exposed to ischemia (30 min) followed by reperfusion (2 h). In the PioC group, pioglitazone (3 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 24 h before ischemia. In the PioC+GA group, after being pretreated with pioglitazone, GA was administered (intraperitoneally, 1 mg/kg) 30 min before ischemia. Myocardial infarct sizes (ISs), apoptosis rates, creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) serum levels were determined. The HSP90, C3, NF-κB, C5a, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and Bax expression levels, as well as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA levels were measured.The myocardial ISs, serum CK-MB, cTnI and LDH levels, apoptosis rates, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, ICAM-1 release, as well as Bax, C5a, C3, and NF-κB protein expression were considerably lower in the PioC group than in the I/R group (p < 0.05). The Bcl-2 and HSP90 expression was higher in the PioC group than in the I/R group (p < 0.05). Geldanamycin inhibited the effects of PioC. These data strongly demonstrate that the PioC-induced is dependent upon HSP90 activity.The HSP90 is indispensable for PioC-mediated cardioprotection. The HSP90 attenuates I/R-induced ISs, apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and myocardial inflammation through C3, C5a and NF-κB activation inhibition.","['C3', 'C5a', 'HSP90', 'NF-κB', 'pioglitazone preconditioning']",2022-05-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37138441,Effects of Cilostazol on the Myocardium in an Obese Wistar Rat Model of Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"This study aims to determine the protective effect of cilostazol on myocardium in obese Wistar rats with induced ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).Four groups with 10 Wistar rats were included: 1] Sham Group: IRI was not established in normal weight-Wistar rats. 2] Control Group: IRI but no cilostazol in normal weight-Wistar rats. 3] Cilostazol in normal weight-Wistar rats: IRI and cilostazol was administered. 4] Cilostazol in obeseWistar rats: IRI and cilostazol was administered.Tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were significantly higher and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels significantly lower in the control group than in the sham group and normal weight cilostazol group (p=0.024 and p=0.003). Fibrinogen levels were 198 mg/dL in the sham group, 204 mg/dL in the control group, and 187 mg/dL in the normal-weight cilostazol group (p=0.046). Additionally, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels were significantly higher in the control group (p=0.047). The level of ATP was significantly lower in the normal-weight cilostazol group than in the obese group (104 vs 131.2 nmol/g protein, p=0.043). PAI-1 level was 2.4 ng/mL in the normal weight cilostazol group and 3.7 ng/mL in the obese cilostazol group (p=0.029). Normal-weight Wistar rats with cilostazol had significantly better histologic outcomes than the control group and obese Wistar rats (p=0.001 and p=0.001).Cilostazol has a protective effect on myocardial cells in IRI models by decreasing inflammation. The protective role of cilostazol was reduced in obese Wistar rats compared with normal-weight Wistar rats.","['ATP', 'IRI model', 'PAI-1', 'cilostazol', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'obese', 'plasminogen activator', 'wistar ratt']",2022-11-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37138283,Neuropilin-1 promotes mitochondrial structural repair and functional recovery in rats with cerebral ischemia.,"Available literature documents that ischemic stroke can disrupt the morphology and function of mitochondria and that the latter in other disease models can be preserved by neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) via oxidative stress suppression. However, whether NRP-1 can repair mitochondrial structure and promote functional recovery after cerebral ischemia is still unknown. This study tackled this very issue and explored the underlying mechanism.Adeno-associated viral (AAV)-NRP-1 was stereotaxically inoculated into the cortex and ipsilateral striatum posterior of adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats before a 90-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and subsequent reperfusion. Lentivirus (LV)-NRP-1 was transfected into rat primary cortical neuronal cultures before a 2-h oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury to neurons. The expression and function of NRP-1 and its specific protective mechanism were investigated by Western Blot, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, magnetic resonance imaging, transmission electron microscopy, etc. The binding was detected by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.Both in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury presented a sharp increase in NRP-1 expression. The expression of AAV-NRP-1 markedly ameliorated the cerebral I/R-induced damage to the motor function and restored the mitochondrial morphology. The expression of LV-NRP-1 alleviated mitochondrial oxidative stress and bioenergetic deficits. AAV-NRP-1 and LV-NRP-1 treatments increased the wingless integration (Wnt)-associated signals and β-catenin nuclear localization. The protective effects of NRP-1 were reversed by the administration of XAV-939.NRP-1 can produce neuroprotective effects against I/R injury to the brain by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and promoting mitochondrial structural repair and functional recovery, which may serve as a promising candidate target in treating ischemic stroke.","['Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Mitochondrial structure and function', 'NRP-1', 'Neuronal apoptosis', 'Oxidative stress']",2023-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37138027,Acute kidney injury decreases pulmonary vascular growth and alveolarization in neonatal rat pups.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in sick neonates and associated with poor pulmonary outcomes, however, the mechanisms responsible remain unknown. We present two novel neonatal rodent models of AKI to investigate the pulmonary effects of AKI.In rat pups, AKI was induced surgically via bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (bIRI) or pharmacologically using aristolochic acid (AA). AKI was confirmed with plasma blood urea nitrogen and creatinine measurements and kidney injury molecule-1 staining on renal immunohistochemistry. Lung morphometrics were quantified with radial alveolar count and mean linear intercept, and angiogenesis investigated by pulmonary vessel density (PVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression. For the surgical model, bIRI, sham, and non-surgical pups were compared. For the pharmacologic model, AA pups were compared to vehicle controls.AKI occurred in bIRI and AA pups, and they demonstrated decreased alveolarization, PVD, and VEGF protein expression compared controls. Sham pups did not experience AKI, however, demonstrated decreased alveolarization, PVD, and VEGF protein expression compared to controls.Pharmacologic AKI and surgery in neonatal rat pups, with or without AKI, decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis, producing a bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotype. These models provide a framework for elucidating the relationship between AKI and adverse pulmonary outcomes.There are no published neonatal rodent models investigating the pulmonary effects after neonatal acute kidney injury, despite known clinical associations. We present two novel neonatal rodent models of acute kidney injury to study the impact of acute kidney injury on the developing lung. We demonstrate the pulmonary effects of both ischemia-reperfusion injury and nephrotoxin-induced AKI on the developing lung, with decreased alveolarization and angiogenesis, mimicking the lung phenotype of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, degenerative preantral and antral follicle cells and inflammatory cells around blood vessels were seen in IR group. Negative IL-6 expression was observed in seminal epithelial cells, preantral and antral follicle cells in IR+EPH group. While caspase-3 activity increased in granulosa cells and stromal cells in IR group, caspase-3 expression was negative in preantral and antral follicle cells in the germinal epithelium and cortex in IR+EPH group.The effect of apoptosis, which occurs with the signaling that starts in the cell nucleus, caused the cessation of the stimulating effect at the nuclear level after EPH administration, and a decrease in the antioxidative effect in IR damage and inflammation in the apoptotic process.",[],2023-01-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37132755,Experimental model of nephropathy associated with diabetes mellitus in mice.,"Nontransmissible chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and nephropathy, affect a significant portion of the population, often treated due to injuries that require healing and regeneration. To create an experimental model of associated comorbidities, for healing and regeneration studies, protocols for induction of nephropathy by ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) and induction of DM by injection of streptozotocin (STZ) were associated.Sixty-four mice (Mus musculus), female, adult, Swiss strain, weighing approximately 20 g, were divided into four groups: G1: control (n = 24), G2: nephropathy group (N) (n = 7), G3, DM (n = 9), and G4: N+DM (n = 24). Arteriovenous stenosis (I/R) of the left kidney was performed as the first protocol. The animals received a hyperlipidemic diet for 7 days after the injection of STZ (150 mg/kg, via i.p.) and an aqueous glucose solution (10%) for 24 h. The animals in the G3 and G4 groups were observed for 14 days before receiving the diet and STZ. The evolution of nephropathy was observed using a urine test strip and the DM, through the analysis of blood glucose with a reagent strip on a digital monitor.The ischemic induction protocols of nephropathy and DM with STZ, associated, were sustainable, low-cost, and without deaths. There were alterations compatible with initial renal alterations, in the first 14 days, such as increased urinary density, pH alteration, presence of glucose, proteins and leukocytes, when compared to the control group. DM was confirmed by the presence of hyperglycemia 7 days after induction and its evolution after 14 days. The animals in the G4 group showed constant weight loss when compared to the other groups. It was possible to observe morphological alterations in the kidneys submitted to I/R, regarding coloration, during surgery and after the end of the observation period, in the volume and size of the left kidney, when compared to the contralateral kidney.It was possible to induce nephropathy and DM associated in the same animal, in a simple way, confirmed with rapid tests, without losses, providing a basis for future studies.",[],2022-04-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

After treatment with different concentrations of C3G, the levels of renal dysfunction and tissue structural damage decreased at different levels. And its protective effect was most pronounced at 200 mg/kg. The use of C3G reduced apoptosis as well as the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related proteins. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced apoptosis and ERS are dependent on oxidative stress in vitro. In addition, both AG490 and C3G inhibited the activation of JAK/STAT pathway and attenuated oxidative stress, ischemia-induced apoptosis and ERS.The results demonstrated that C3G blocked renal apoptosis and ERS protein expression by preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after I/R via the JAK/STAT pathway, suggesting that C3G may be a potential therapeutic agent for renal I/R injury.",[],2022-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Results showed that over-expression of miR-21-3p against the protective effects of OL-FS13 on oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-damaged pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and in CI/R-injured rats. miR-21-3p was then found to target calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CAMKK2), and its overexpression inhibited the expression of CAMKK2 and phosphorylation of its downstream adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thereby inhibiting the therapeutic effects of OL-FS13 on OGD/R and CI/R. Inhibition of CAMKK2 also antagonized up-regulated of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) by OL-FS13, thereby abolishing the antioxidant activity of the peptide.Our results showed that OL-FS13 alleviated OGD/R and CI/R by inhibiting miR-21-3p to activate the CAMKK2/AMPK/Nrf-2 axis.","['CAMKK2/AMPK pathway', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'microRNA', 'neuroprotective', 'oxidative stress', 'peptide']",2022-09-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Male SD rats were induced using a 1.5 h tMCAO, following by reperfusion for 22.5 h. Engeletin (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was intravenously administered immediately following 0.5 h of ischemia. Based on our results, engeletin, in a dose-dependent fashion, reduced neurological deficits, infarct size, histopathological alterations, brain edema and inflammatory factors, namely, circulating IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ. Furthermore, engeletin treatment markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis, which, in turn, elevated Bcl-2 protein levels, while suppressing Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 protein levels. Meanwhile, engeletin significantly reduces overall expressions of HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-κB and attenuated nuclear transfer of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in ischemic cortical tissue. In conclusion, engeletin strongly prevents focal cerebral ischemia via suppression of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory network.","['HMGB1', 'NF-κB', 'TLR4', 'engeletin', 'inflammation', 'ischemic stroke']",2023-02-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37131819,MCU gain-and loss-of-function models define the duality of mitochondrial calcium uptake in heart failure.,"Mitochondrial calcium ( m Ca 2+ ) uptake through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU) stimulates metabolism to meet acute increases in cardiac energy demand. However, excessive m Ca 2+ uptake during stress, as in ischemia-reperfusion, initiates permeability transition and cell death. Despite these often-reported acute physiological and pathological effects, a major unresolved controversy is whether mtCU-dependent m Ca 2+ uptake and long-term elevation of cardiomyocyte m Ca 2+ contributes to the heart's adaptation during sustained increases in workload.We tested the hypothesis that mtCU-dependent m Ca 2+ uptake contributes to cardiac adaptation and ventricular remodeling during sustained catecholaminergic stress.Mice with tamoxifen-inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific gain (αMHC-MCM x flox-stop-MCU; MCU-Tg) or loss (αMHC-MCM x Mcu fl/fl ; Mcu -cKO) of mtCU function received 2-wk catecholamine infusion.Cardiac contractility increased after 2d of isoproterenol in control, but not Mcu -cKO mice. Contractility declined and cardiac hypertrophy increased after 1-2-wk of isoproterenol in MCU-Tg mice. MCU-Tg cardiomyocytes displayed increased sensitivity to Ca 2+ - and isoproterenol-induced necrosis. However, loss of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) regulator cyclophilin D failed to attenuate contractile dysfunction and hypertrophic remodeling, and increased isoproterenol-induced cardiomyocyte death in MCU-Tg mice.mtCU m Ca 2+ uptake is required for early contractile responses to adrenergic signaling, even those occurring over several days. Under sustained adrenergic load excessive MCU-dependent m Ca 2+ uptake drives cardiomyocyte dropout, perhaps independent of classical mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, and compromises contractile function. These findings suggest divergent consequences for acute versus sustained m Ca 2+ loading, and support distinct functional roles for the mPTP in settings of acute m Ca 2+ overload versus persistent m Ca 2+ stress.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression, distribution, and functionality of IGF2R in various I/R-associated models (such as reoxygenation, revascularization, and heart transplant). Loss-of-function studies (including myocardial conditional knockout and CRISPR interference) were performed to clarify the role of IGF2R in I/R injuries. Following hypoxia, IGF2R expression increased, but this effect was reversed upon restoration of oxygen levels. Loss of myocardial IGF2R was found to enhance the cardiac contractile functions, and reduced cell infiltration or cardiac fibrosis of I/R mouse models compared to the genotype control. CRISPR-inhibition of IGF2R decreased cell apoptotic death under hypoxia. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that myocardial IGF2R played a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response, innate immune response, and apoptotic process following I/R. Integrated analysis of the mRNA profiling, pulldown assays, and mass spectrometry identified granulocyte-specific factors as potential targets of myocardial IGF2R in the injured heart. In conclusion, myocardial IGF2R emerges as a promising therapeutic target to ameliorate inflammation or fibrosis following I/R injuries.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37131546,Mesoporous Hollow Manganese Doped Ceria Nanoparticle for Effectively Prevention of Hepatic Ischemia Reperfusion Injury.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is the main reason for liver dysfunction or failure after liver resection and liver transplantation. As excess accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the leading factor, ceria nanoparticle, a cyclic reversible antioxidant, is an excellent candidate for HIRI.Manganese doped mesoporous hollow ceria nanoparticles (MnOx-CeO2 NPs) were prepared, and the physicochemical characteristics, such as particle size, morphology, microstructure, etc. were elucidated. The in vivo safety and liver targeting effect were examined after i.v. injection. The anti-HIRI was determined by a mouse HIRI model.MnOx-CeO2 NPs with 0.40% Mn doped exhibited the strongest ROS-scavenging capability, which may due to the increased specific surface area and surface oxygen concentration. The nanoparticles accumulated in the liver after i.v. injection and exhibited good biocompatibility. In the HIRI mice model, MnOx-CeO2 NPs significantly reduced the serum ALT and AST level, decreased the MDA level and increased the SOD level in the liver, prevent pathological damages in the liver.MnOx-CeO2 NPs were successfully prepared and it could significantly inhibit the HIRI after i.v. injection.","['Mn-doped mesoporous hollow cerium oxide nanoparticles', 'hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury', 'oxidative stress']",2022-12-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37131448,The efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on rat intestinal immune-function injured by ischemia/reperfusion.,"Transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has a promising therapeutic efficiency for varieties of disorders caused by ischemia or reperfusion impairment. It has been shown that BMSCs can mitigate intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed at investigating the efficacy of BMSCs on the immune function of intestinal mucosal microenvironment after I/R injuries.Twenty adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a treatment or a control group. All the rats underwent superior mesenteric artery clamping and unclamping. In the treatment group, BMSCs were implanted into the intestine of ten rats by direct submucosal injection whereas the other ten rats in the control group were injected with the same volume of saline. On the fourth and seventh day after BMSCs transplantation, intestinal samples were examined for the CD4 (CD4-positive T-lymphocytes)/CD8 (CD8-positive T-lymphocytes) ratio of the bowel mucosa via flow cytometry, and for the level of Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) via ELISA. Paneth cell counts and Secretory Immunoglobulin A (SIgA) level were examined via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Real time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and trypsinogen (Serine 2) (PRSS2) genes. White blood cell (WBC) count was measured by manual counting under the microscope.The CD4/CD8 ratio in the treatment group was significantly lower compared with that in the control group. The concentration of IL-2 and IL-6 was lower in the treatment group compared with the control group, while the level of IL-4 is the reverse between the two groups. The number of Paneth cells in intestinal mucosa increased significantly, while the level of SIgA in intestinal mucosa decreased significantly, after BMSCs transplantation. The gene expression levels of TNF-α and PRSS2 in intestinal mucosa of treatment group were significantly lower than those of control group. The WBC count in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group.We identified immune-relevant molecular changes that may explain the mechanism of BMSCs transplantation efficacy in alleviating rat intestinal immune-barrier after I/R.","['Intestinal mucosal immune barrier', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Repair mechanism']",2022-09-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37131045,Ischemic tubular injury: Oxygen-sensitive signals and metabolic reprogramming.,"The kidneys are the most vulnerable organs to severe ischemic insult that results in cellular hypoxia under pathophysiological conditions. Large amounts of oxygen are consumed by the kidneys, mainly to produce energy for tubular reabsorption. Beyond high oxygen demand and the low oxygen supply, different other factors make kidneys vulnerable to ischemia which is deemed to be a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). On the other hand, kidneys are capable of sensing and responding to oxygen alternations to evade harms resulting from inadequate oxygen. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the main conserved oxygen-sensing mechanism that maintains homeostasis under hypoxia through direct/indirect regulation of several genes that contribute to metabolic adaptation, angiogenesis, energy conservation, erythropoiesis, and so on. In response to oxygen availability, prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) control the HIF stability. This review focuses on the oxygen-sensing mechanisms in kidneys, particularly in proximal tubular cells (PTCs) and discusses the molecules involved in ischemic response and metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, the possible roles of non-coding RNAs (microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) in the development of ischemic AKI are put forward.","['Acute kidney injury', 'HIF-1α', 'Hypoxia', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Ischemic kidney', 'Oxygen sensing']",2022-07-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Nevertheless, there are few reports on its action on intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In this study, we mainly explored the effect of Bryo-1 on intestinal I/R injury and determined the mechanism. C57BL/6J mice underwent temporary superior mesenteric artery (SMA) obturation to induce I/R, on the contrary, Caco-2 cells suffered to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) to establish the in vitro model. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS to induce macrophage inflammation. The drug gradient experiment was used to demonstrate in vivo and in vitro models. Bryo-1 ameliorated the intestinal I/R-induced injury of multiple organs and epithelial cells. It also alleviated intestinal I/R-induced barrier disruption of intestines according to the histology, intestinal permeability, intestinal bacterial translocation rates, and tight junction protein expression results. Bryo-1 significantly inhibited oxidative stress damages and inflammation, which may contribute to the restoration of intestinal barrier function. Further, Bryo-1 significantly activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in vivo. However, the deletion of Nrf2 in Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells attenuated the protective functions of Bryo-1 and significantly abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of Bryo-1 on LPS-induced macrophage inflammation. Bryo-1 protects intestines against I/R-induced injury. It is associated with intestinal barrier protection, as well as inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress partly through Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.","['bryostatin-1', 'inflammation', 'intestinal barrier', 'intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'oxidative stress']",2022-09-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37129843,PPARγ Regulates Macrophage Polarization by Inhibiting the JAK/STAT Pathway and Attenuates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury In Vivo.,"This study aimed to investigate the role of PPARγ and underlying mechanisms in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). IRI was surgically induced in mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). Quantitative genetic analysis and western blotting were performed to assess mRNA and protein levels, respectively, of PPARγ, as well as of different inflammatory, fibrosis, and apoptosis markers in cells and tissues. PPARγ was overexpressed in the heart of mice and NRCMs by viral transfection. Apoptosis and fibrosis were detected by TUNEL and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect M1 and M2 macrophage-related inflammatory factors present in mouse sera. PPARγ overexpression significantly inhibited OGD/R- and IRI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PPARγ overexpression inhibited IRI-induced secretion of M1-related proinflammatory factors, whereas it supported the secretion of M2-related anti-inflammatory factors. Notably, these events were found to be mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway. In conclusion, PPARγ regulates macrophage polarization upon IRI via the JAK/STAT pathway, which will in turn prevent myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis. Hence, PPARγ may represent a valuable target for myocardial IRI treatment.","['JAK/STAT pathway', 'Myocardial apoptosis', 'Myocardial fibrosis', 'PPARγ', 'Polarized macrophages']",2022-12-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37128919,Elevated LDL Cholesterol Increases Microvascular Endothelial VWF and Thromboinflammation After Myocardial Infarction.,"In reperfused myocardial infarction, VWF (von Willebrand factor)-mediated platelet adhesion contributes to impaired microvascular reflow and possibly also to postmyocardial infarction inflammation. We hypothesized that postischemic thromboinflammatory processes are worsened by elevated LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion or sham procedure was performed in wild-type mice and hyperlipidemic mice deficient for the LDL receptor and Apobec-1 (apolipoprotein-B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-1; DKO [double knockout]). DKO subgroups were treated with N-acetylcysteine, which inhibits pro-adhesive VWF multimers or with recombinant ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-13), which enzymatically cleaves endothelial surface-associated VWF. Myocardial contrast echocardiography perfusion imaging and molecular imaging for VWF, platelet glycoprotein Ibα, and leukocyte CD18 (cluster of differentiation) were performed 30 minutes post-reperfusion. Histology, infarct sizing, and echocardiography were performed at 1.5 or 72 hours; late echocardiography was performed at day 21.After ischemia-reperfusion, DKO compared with wild-type mice had ≈2-fold higher (P<0.05) risk area signal for microvascular platelet adhesion, VWF, and CD18; greater impairment in microvascular reflow, and 2-fold larger infarct size. Treatment of DKO mice with N-acetylcysteine and ADAMTS13 reduced molecular imaging signal for microvascular platelet adhesion, VWF, and CD18; improved early microvascular reflow; and reduced eventual infarct size. ADAMTS13 suppressed the postmyocardial infarction neutrophil and monocyte infiltration, enhanced the time-dependent recovery of left ventricular systolic function, and prevented late left ventricular remodeling.In reperfused myocardial infarction, elevated LDL cholesterol promotes thromboinflammation through excess microvascular endothelial VWF and platelet adhesion, resulting in less microvascular reflow and larger infarct size. In the presence of elevated LDL cholesterol, therapies that suppress endothelial-associated VWF can promote recovery of left ventricular function and protect against remodeling.","['cholesterol, LDL', 'microcirculation', 'monocytes', 'myocardial infarction', 'von Willebrand factor']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37128895,Heterogeneity of Repolarization and Cell-Cell Variability of Cardiomyocyte Remodeling Within the Myocardial Infarction Border Zone Contribute to Arrhythmia Susceptibility.,"After myocardial infarction, the infarct border zone (BZ) is the dominant source of life-threatening arrhythmias, where fibrosis and abnormal repolarization create a substrate for reentry. We examined whether repolarization abnormalities are heterogeneous within the BZ in vivo and could be related to heterogeneous cardiomyocyte remodeling.Myocardial infarction was induced in domestic pigs by 120-minute ischemia followed by reperfusion. After 1 month, remodeling was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and electroanatomical mapping was performed to determine the spatial distribution of activation-recovery intervals. Cardiomyocytes were isolated and tissue samples collected from the BZ and remote regions. Optical recording allowed assessment of action potential duration (di-8-ANEPPS, stimulation at 1 Hz, 37 °C) of large cardiomyocyte populations while gene expression in cardiomyocytes was determined by single nuclear RNA sequencing.In vivo, activation-recovery intervals in the BZ tended to be longer than in remote with increased spatial heterogeneity evidenced by a greater local SD (3.5±1.3 ms versus remote: 2.0±0.5 ms, P=0.036, npigs=5). Increased activation-recovery interval heterogeneity correlated with enhanced arrhythmia susceptibility. Cellular population studies (ncells=635-862 cells per region) demonstrated greater heterogeneity of action potential duration in the BZ (SD, 105.9±17.0 ms versus remote: 73.9±8.6 ms; P=0.001; npigs=6), which correlated with heterogeneity of activation-recovery interval in vivo. Cell-cell gene expression heterogeneity in the BZ was evidenced by increased Euclidean distances between nuclei of the BZ (12.1 [9.2-15.0] versus 10.6 [7.5-11.6] in remote; P<0.0001). Differentially expressed genes characterizing BZ cardiomyocyte remodeling included hypertrophy-related and ion channel-related genes with high cell-cell variability of expression. These gene expression changes were driven by stress-responsive TFs (transcription factors). In addition, heterogeneity of left ventricular wall thickness was greater in the BZ than in remote.Heterogeneous cardiomyocyte remodeling in the BZ is driven by uniquely altered gene expression, related to heterogeneity in the local microenvironment, and translates to heterogeneous repolarization and arrhythmia vulnerability in vivo.","['arrhythmias', 'cardiac remodeling', 'hypertrophy', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'myocardial infarction', 'single-cell gene expression analysis', 'voltage-sensitive dye imaging']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37128885,Blocking RIPK2 Function Alleviates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Regulating the AKT and NF-κB Pathways.,"Inflammation and oxidation brought on by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury lead to cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis. The receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (RIPK2) plays significant roles in oxidative stress and excessive inflammation. The purpose of this research is to examine the roles of RIPK2 in MI/R injury.The in vivo animal model was constructed by acute coronary I/R, and the in vitro cell model was established by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-stimulated cardiomyocyte injury. RIPK2 expression was examined using qRT-PCR and Western blot. CCK-8 was proposed as a method for detecting cell proliferation. ELISA was utilized to measure inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) and myocardial injury indicators (CK-MB, Mb, cTnI, and LDH). The levels of MDA and ROS were determined by the kit and fluorescent probe. H&E was conducted to assess MI/R injury after silencing of RIPK2.In MI/R rats and OGD/R-treated H9C2 cardiomyocytes, RIPK2 was overexpressed at both the mRNA and protein levels. RIPK2 inhibition promoted cell proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved caspase-3. RIPK2 inhibition reduced MDA and ROS levels, as well as the contents of inflammatory factors. RIPK2 silencing reduced CK-MB, Mb, cTnI, and LDH levels in rat serum and alleviated MI/R injury. Furthermore, RIPK2 inhibition increased p-AKT while decreasing NF-B p-p65 expression.Silencing of RIPK2 reduced apoptosis, proinflammatory factors, and oxidative stress in MI/R by activating AKT and suppressing NF-κB signals, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for MI/R injury.","['AKT/NF-κB', 'myocardial ischemia-reperfusion', 'receptor interacting serine/threonine kinase 2']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37128751,Brain-targeted ginkgolide B-modified carbonized polymer dots for alleviating cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a leading cause of death in the world, and there is still a lack of effective treatments. Ginkgolide B (GB) can antagonize the platelet activating factor receptor and has shown a significant curative effect on cerebral ischemia. However, GB and other drugs for IS have shown poor clinical efficacy due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) were developed as biocompatible nanocarriers to deliver GB to the brain tissue. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments verified the ability of GB-CPDs to penetrate the BBB, and GB-CPDs remained in the brain significantly longer than unmodified CPDs. In a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), circulatory administration of GB-CPDs effectively reduced cerebral infarct size and neuronal apoptosis, with a significantly better therapeutic effect compared to GB. This study provided a novel GB-based nanodrug that could target the brain with improved efficacy, showing great application potential in central nervous system diseases.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37128130,Procyanidin B2 regulates the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway to improve random-pattern skin flap survival.,"Random-pattern skin flaps have been widely used in the reconstruction of damaged tissues. Ischemia-reperfusion injury occurring in the distal regions of the flap is a common issue, which often leads to flap necrosis and restricts its clinical applications. Procyanidin B2 (PB2), a naturally occurring flavonoid in large quantities in various fruits, has been demonstrated to exhibit several significant pharmacological properties. However, the effect of PB2 on flap viability is not clearly known. Here, using Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining, we observed that PB2 significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and enhanced angiogenesis. Mechanically, we provided evidence for the first time that the beneficial effects of PB2 occur through the activation of the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, co-administration of PB2 and EX527, a selective inhibitor of Sirt1, resulted in down-regulation of the expression of Sirt1, Nrf2, and downstream antioxidants. In summary, our study showed that PB2 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the survival of random-pattern skin flaps.","['Sirt1/Nrf2', 'angiogenesis', 'inflammation', 'oxidative stress', 'procyanidin B2', 'random-pattern skin flaps']",2022-11-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37127632,"Evaluation of the efficacy of HEMO2life®, a marine OXYgen carrier for Organ Preservation (OxyOp2) in renal transplantation: study protocol for a multicenter randomized trial.","Preventing ischemia‒reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major issue in kidney transplantation, particularly for transplant recipients receiving a kidney from extended criteria donors (ECD). The main consequence of IRI is delayed graft function (DGF). Hypoxia is one of the key factors in IRI, suggesting that the use of an oxygen carrier as an additive to preservation solution may be useful. In the OxyOp trial, we showed that the organs preserved using the oxygen carrier HEMO2life® displayed significantly less DGF. In the OxyOp2 trial, we aim to definitively test and quantify the efficacy of HEMO2life® for organ preservation in a large population of kidney grafts.OxyOp2 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, comparative, single-blinded, parallel-group study versus standard of care in renal transplantation. After the selection of a suitable donor according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, both kidneys will be used in the study. Depending on the characteristics of the donor, both kidneys will be preserved either in static cold storage (standard donors) or on machine perfusion (for ECD and deceased-after-cardiac-death donors (DCD)). The kidneys resulting from one donor will be randomized: one to the standard-of-care arm (organ preserved in preservation solution routinely used according to the local practice) and the other to the active treatment arm (HEMO2life® on top of routinely used preservation solution). HEMO2life® will be used for ex vivo graft preservation at a dose of 1 g/l preservation solution. The primary outcome is the occurrence of DGF, defined as the need for renal replacement therapy during the first week after transplantation.The use of HEMO2life® in preservation solutions is a novel approach allowing, for the first time, the delivery of oxygen to organs.

37127576,CIRP attenuates acute kidney injury after hypothermic cardiovascular surgery by inhibiting PHD3/HIF-1α-mediated ROS-TGF-β1/p38 MAPK activation and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.,"The ischemia-reperfusion (IR) environment during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) cardiovascular surgery is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), which lacks preventive measure and treatment. It was reported that cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) can be induced under hypoxic and hypothermic stress and may have a protective effect on multiple organs. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CIRP could exert renoprotective effect during hypothermic IR and the potential mechanisms.Utilizing RNA-sequencing, we compared the differences in gene expression between Cirp knockout rats and wild-type rats after DHCA and screened the possible mechanisms. Then, we established the hypothermic oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model using HK-2 cells transfected with siRNA to verify the downstream pathways and explore potential pharmacological approach. The effects of CIRP and enarodustat (JTZ-951) on renal IR injury (IRI) were investigated in vivo and in vitro using multiple levels of pathological and molecular biological experiments.We discovered that Cirp knockout significantly upregulated rat Phd3 expression, which is the key regulator of HIF-1α, thereby inhibiting HIF-1α after DHCA. In addition, deletion of Cirp in rat model promoted apoptosis and aggravated renal injury by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and significant activation of the TGF-β1/p38 MAPK inflammatory pathway. Then, based on the HK-2 cell model of hypothermic OGD, we found that CIRP silencing significantly stimulated the expression of the TGF-β1/p38 MAPK inflammatory pathway by activating the PHD3/HIF-1α axis, and induced more severe apoptosis through the mitochondrial cytochrome c-Apaf-1-caspase 9 and FADD-caspase 8 death receptor pathways compared with untransfected cells. However, silencing PHD3 remarkably activated the expression of HIF-1α and alleviated the apoptosis of HK-2 cells in hypothermic OGD. On this basis, by pretreating HK-2 and rats with enarodustat, a novel HIF-1α stabilizer, we found that enarodustat significantly mitigated renal cellular apoptosis under hypothermic IR and reversed the aggravated IRI induced by CIRP defect, both in vitro and in vivo.Our findings indicated that CIRP may confer renoprotection against hypothermic IRI by suppressing PHD3/HIF-1α-mediated apoptosis. PHD3 inhibitors and HIF-1α stabilizers may have clinical value in renal IRI.","['Apoptosis', 'Cold inducible RNA-binding protein', 'Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest', 'Enarodustat', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α', 'Ischemia–reperfusion', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Renoprotection']",2022-09-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37127072,Risk of Prolonged Ischaemic Time linked to use of Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass during Implantation for Lung Transplantation in the United Kingdom.,"Some degree of ischaemia is inevitable in organ transplantation and for most, if not all organs, there is a relationship between ischaemic time and transplant outcome. The contribution of ischaemic time to lung injury is unclear, with conflicting recent data. In this study we investigate the impact of ischemia time upon survival after lung transplantation, in a large national cohort.We studied the outcomes for 1565 UK adult lung transplants over a 12-year period, for whom donor, transplant and recipient data were available from the UK Transplant Registry. We examined the effect of ischaemia time (defined as donor cross clamp to recipient reperfusion) and whether standard cardiopulmonary bypass was used using cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for other risk factors.Total ischaemic time increased from a median under 5 hours in 2003 to over 6.2 hours in 2013. Our findings show that when cardiopulmonary bypass was used, there was an increase in the hazard of death (of 13% (95% CI: 5%-21%) for one-year patient survival) for each hour of total ischaemic time. However, if the cardiopulmonary bypass was not used for implantation, this link disappeared - there was no statistically significant change in mortality with increasing ischaemic time.We document that avoidance of bypass may remove ischaemic time, within the limits of our observed range of ischaemic times, as a risk factor for poor outcome. Our data, adds to the evidence that bypass may be harmful to the donor lung.","['Lung Ischaemia Time', 'Primary Graft Dysfunction', 'cardiopulmonary bypass']",2022-08-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37126929,Vitamin B12 alleviates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via the SIRT3/AMPK signaling pathway.,"To examine the protective effect of vitamin B12 against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and elucidate its underlying mechanism of action.Mice were subjected to myocardial I/R injury by left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion followed by 24 h reperfusion. Cardiac function and injury were evaluated by echocardiography, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) staining, and measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, various molecular and biochemical methods, as well as RNA sequencing were used to determine the effects and mechanism of action of vitamin B12 on I/R injury.We found that high doses of vitamin B12 inhibited myocardial I/R injury. Furthermore, our data indicated that vitamin B12 supplementation alleviated cardiac dysfunction and injury by mitigating oxidative stress and apoptosis through downregulation of Nox2, the Ac-SOD2/SOD2 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios and cleaved caspase-3 expression, and upregulation of SIRT3 expression and AMPK activity. However, these effects were largely reversed following treatment with the SIRT3 inhibitor, 3-TYP. Our RNA-sequencing data further demonstrated that vitamin B12 supplementation reduced inflammation during I/R injury.High doses of vitamin B12 supplements improved myocardial I/R injury by suppressing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis of myocardial tissue through modulation of the SIRT3/AMPK signaling pathway, while reducing inflammation. Our findings suggested that vitamin B12 administered at high doses could be a potential therapy for myocardial I/R damage.","['AMPK', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'SIRT3', 'Vitamin B12']",2023-02-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This study compared IVT plus MT vs MT alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion in whom mechanical reperfusion was unsuccessful. Unsuccessful mechanical reperfusion was defined as failed (final modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade of 0 or 1) or partial (grade 2a). Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were matched by treatment group using 1:1 propensity score matching.Mechanical thrombectomy with or without IVT.Primary outcome was functional independence at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. Safety outcomes were the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and death.After matching, 746 patients were compared by treatment arms (median age, 78 [IQR, 68-84] years; 438 women [58.7%]). The proportion of patients who were functionally independent at 90 days was 68 of 373 (18.2%) in the IVT plus MT and 42 of 373 (11.3%) in the MT alone group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.63 [95% CI, 1.41-5.11]; P = .003). There was a shift toward better functional outcomes on the modified Rankin Scale favoring IVT plus MT (adjusted common OR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.35-2.92]; P < .001). The treatment benefit of IVT was greater in patients with partial reperfusion compared with failed reperfusion. There was no difference in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages between treatment groups (AOR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.29-1.81]; P = .45), while the death rate was lower after IVT plus MT (AOR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.34-0.86]; P = .01).These findings suggest that prior IVT was safe and improved functional outcomes at 90 days. Partial reperfusion was associated with a greater treatment benefit of IVT, indicating a positive interaction between IVT and MT. These results support current guidelines that all eligible patients with stroke should receive IVT before MT and add a new perspective to the debate on noninferiority of combined stroke treatment.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37125804,Mouse Cardiac Arrest Model for Brain Imaging and Brain Physiology Monitoring During Ischemia and Resuscitation.,"Most cardiac arrest (CA) survivors experience varying degrees of neurologic deficits. To understand the mechanisms that underpin CA-induced brain injury and, subsequently, develop effective treatments, experimental CA research is essential. To this end, a few mouse CA models have been established. In most of these models, the mice are placed in the supine position in order to perform chest compression for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, this resuscitation procedure makes the real-time imaging/monitoring of brain physiology during CA and resuscitation challenging. To obtain such critical knowledge, the present protocol presents a mouse asphyxia CA model that does not require the chest compression CPR step. This model allows for the study of dynamic changes in blood flow, vascular structure, electrical potentials, and brain tissue oxygen from the pre-CA baseline to early post-CA reperfusion. Importantly, this model applies to aged mice. Thus, this mouse CA model is expected to be a critical tool for deciphering the impact of CA on brain physiology.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37125528,Naringin protects against inflammation and apoptosis induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury through deactivation of cGAS-STING signaling pathway.,"Effective amelioration of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced intestinal injury and revealing its mechanisms remain the challenges in both preclinic and clinic. Potential mechanisms of naringin in ameliorating I/R-induced intestinal injury remain unknown. Based on pre-experiments, I/R-injured rat intestine in vivo and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-injured IEC-6 cells in vitro were used to verify that naringin-alleviated I/R-induced intestinal injury was mediated via deactivating cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Naringin improved intestinal damage using hematoxylin and eosin staining and decreased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase contents in plasma. Naringin decreased inflammation characterized by reducing IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-β contents in both plasma and IEC-6 cells. Naringin mitigated oxidative stress via recovering superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde levels in the I/R-injured intestine. Naringin reduced the expression of apoptotic proteins, including Bax, caspase-3, and Bcl-2, and reduced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling-positive cells both in vivo and in vitro, and decreased Hoechst 33342 signals in vitro. cGAS, STING, p-TBK1, p-IRF3, and NF-κB expressions were up-regulated both in vivo and in vitro respectively and the up-regulated indexes were reversed by naringin. Transfection of cGAS-siRNA and cGAS-cDNA significantly down-regulated and up-regulated cGAS-STING signaling-related protein expressions, respectively, and partially weakened naringin-induced amelioration on these indexes, suggesting that deactivation of cGAS-STING signaling is the crucial target for naringin-induced amelioration on I/R-injured intestine.","['apoptosis', 'cGAS-STING', 'inflammation', 'intestinal I/R injury', 'naringin']",2022-10-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37124398,RAGE and its ligand amyloid beta promote retinal ganglion cell loss following ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Glaucoma is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with age. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aß) proteins in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and subsequent retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss is an established pathological hallmark of the disease. The mechanism through which Aß provokes RGC loss remains unclear. The receptor for the advanced glycation end product (RAGE), and its ligand Aß, have been shown to mediate neuronal loss via internalizing Aß within the neurons. In this study, we investigated whether the RAGE-Aß axis plays a role in RGC loss in experimental glaucoma.Retinal ischemia was induced by an acute elevation of intraocular pressure in RAGE-/- and wild-type (WT) control mice. In a subset of animals, oligomeric Aß was injected directly into the vitreous of both strains. RGC loss was assessed using histology and biochemical assays. Baseline and terminal positive scotopic threshold (pSTR) were also recorded.Retinal ischemia resulted in 1.9-fold higher RGC loss in WT mice compared to RAGE-/- mice (36 ± 3% p < 0.0001 vs. 19 ± 2%, p = 0.004). Intravitreal injection of oligomeric Aß resulted in 2.3-fold greater RGC loss in WT mice compared to RAGE-/- mice, 7-days post-injection (55 ± 4% p = 0.008 vs. 24 ± 2%, p = 0.02). We also found a significant decline in the positive scotopic threshold response (pSTR) amplitude of WT mice compared to RAGE-/- (36 ± 3% vs. 16 ± 6%).RAGE-/- mice are protected against RGC loss following retinal ischemia. Intravitreal injection of oligomeric Aß accelerated RGC loss in WT mice but not RAGE-/-. A co-localization of RAGE and Aß, suggests that RAGE-Aß binding may contribute to RGC loss.","['amyloid beta', 'glaucoma', 'receptor for advanced glycation end products', 'retinal ganglion cell loss', 'retinal ischemia-reperfusion']",2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37122869,Nanobiotechnological basis of an oxygen carrier with enhanced carbonic anhydrase for CO2 transport and enhanced catalase and superoxide dismutase for antioxidant function.,"This is a mini review on the biotechnological aspects of the most extensively developed hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers The emphasis is on the most recent Polyhemoglobin-catalase-superoxide dismutase-carbonic anhydrase (PolyHb-CAT-SOD-CA), which is a nanobiotechnological complex that is being investigated and scaled up with the potential for clinical use as nanobiotherapeutics. Hemoglobin, a tetramer, is an excellent oxygen carrier. However, in the body it is converted into toxic dimers. Diacid or glutaraldehyde can crosslink hemoglobin into polyhemoglobin (PolyHb) and prevent its breakdown into toxic dimers. This has been developed and tested in clinical trials. A bovine polyhemoglobin has been approved for routine clinical use for surgical procedures in South Africa and Russia. Clinical trials with human PolyHb in hemorrhagic shock were effective but with a very slight increase in non-fatal myocardial ischemia. This could be due to a number of reasons. For those conditions with ischemia-reperfusion, one would need an oxygen carrier with antioxidant properties. One approach to remedy this is with prepared polyhemoglobin-catalase-superoxide dismutase (PolyHb-CAT-SOD). Another reason is an increase in intracellular pCO2. We therefore added an enhanced level of carbonic anhydrase to prepare a PolyHb-CAT-SOD-CA. The result is an oxygen carrier with enhanced Carbonic Anhydrase for CO2 transport and enhanced Catalase and Superoxide Dismutase for antioxidant functions. Detailed efficacy and safety studies have led to the industrial scale up towards clinical trial. In the meantime, oxygen carriers are being investigated around the world for use in ex vivo biotechnological fluid for organ preservation for transplantation, with one already approved in France.","['antioxidant', 'carbonic anhydrase carbon dioxide carrier', 'catalase', 'nanobiotherapeutic and nanobiotechnology', 'organ preservation and transplantation', 'oxygen carriers', 'oxygen radicals', 'superoxide dismutase']",2023-03-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37121963,"Furosemide exacerbated the impairment of renal function, oxygenation and medullary damage in a rat model of renal ischemia/reperfusion induced AKI.","Perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) caused by ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity after major surgery. Furosemide is commonly used in postoperative patients to promote diuresis and reduce tissue edema. However, the effects of furosemide on renal microcirculation, oxygenation and function are poorly understood during perioperative period following ischemic insult. Herein, we investigated the effects of furosemide in rats subjected IR insult.24 Wistar albino rats were divided into 4 groups, with 6 in each; Sham-operated Control (C), Control + Furosemide (C + F), ischemia/reperfusion (IR), and IR + F. After induction of anesthesia (BL), supra-aortic occlusion was applied to IR and IR + F groups for 45 min followed by ongoing reperfusion for 15 min (T1) and 2 h (T2). Furosemide infusion was initiated simultaneously in the intervention groups after ischemia. Renal blood flow (RBF), vascular resistance (RVR), oxygen delivery (DO2ren) and consumption (VO2ren), sodium reabsorption (TNa+), oxygen utilization efficiency (VO2/TNa+), cortical (CμO2) and medullary (MμO2) microvascular oxygen pressures, urine output (UO) and creatinine clearance (Ccr) were measured. Biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress were measured and kidneys were harvested for histological analysis.IR significantly decreased RBF, mainly by increasing RVR, which was exacerbated in the IR + F group at T2 (2198 ± 879 vs 4233 ± 2636 dyne/s/cm5, p = 0.07). CμO2 (61.6 ± 6.8 vs 86 ± 6.6 mmHg) and MμO2 (51.1 ± 4.1 vs 68.7 ± 4.9 mmHg, p < 0.05) were both reduced after IR and did not improve by furosemide. Moreover, VO2/TNa+ increased in the IR + F group at T2 with respect to the IR group (IR: 3.3 ± 2 vs IR + F: 8.2 ± 10 p = 0.07) suggesting a possible deterioration of oxygen utilization. Ccr did not change, but plasma creatinine increased significantly in IR + F groups. Histopathology revealed widespread damage both in the cortex and medulla in IR, IR + F and C + F groups.Renal microvascular oxygenation, renal function, renal vascular resistance, oxygen utilization and damage were not improved by furosemide administration after IR insult. Our study suggests that furosemide may cause additional structural and functional impairment to the kidney following ischemic injury and should be used with caution.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Creatinine', 'Furosemide', 'Oxygenation', 'Renal failure', 'Urine output']",2022-09-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37121662,Burn wound conversion: clinical implications for the treatment of severe burns.,"The identification of novel treatments for severe burn wounds relies on accurate clinical assessments of the extent of injury. However, evaluation of burn wound depth can be challenging due to the tendency for burn wounds to progress over time in a little-understood process known as 'burn wound conversion'. Local factors affecting the burn wound, such as inflammation, oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, vasostasis and bacterial infections, lead to increased cell death by apoptosis or oncosis, while systemic events may promote burn wound conversion. Acute shock, metabolic derangements, age or immunomodulation can modify cytokine secretion, lower immune responses, decrease blood flow or cause bacterial infection at the burn wound site. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting specific mechanisms that reduce cell death, improve wound reperfusion and promote tissue regrowth should favourably enhance burn wound healing, and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Our current understanding of these mechanisms mostly comes from animal studies, underscoring the need for extensive research in humans. A streamlined approach would be to investigate the parallels in other disease states that exhibit ischaemia and potential reperfusion, such as ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Moreover, in view of the limited knowledge available on the subject, the need exists for further clinical research into burn wound conversion and novel target pathways to ameliorate its effects. This review describes events that affect the viability of cells at the burn wound site resulting in burn wound conversion, and identifies potential targets for clinical interventions that may diminish burn wound conversion.","['apoptosis', 'burn', 'burn pathophysiology', 'burn wound conversion', 'clinical interventions', 'inflammation', 'oncosis', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound dressing', 'wound healing']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37121432,Strikingly conserved gene expression changes of polyamine regulating enzymes among various forms of acute and chronic kidney injury.,"The polyamines spermidine and spermine and their common precursor molecule putrescine are involved in tissue injury and repair. Here, we test the hypothesis that impaired polyamine homeostasis contributes to various kidney pathologies in mice during experimental models of ischemia-reperfusion, transplantation, rhabdomyolysis, cyclosporine treatment, arterial hypertension, diabetes, unilateral ureteral obstruction, high oxalate feeding, and adenine-induced injuries. We found a remarkably similar pattern in most kidney pathologies with reduced expression of enzymes involved in polyamine synthesis together with increased expression of polyamine degrading enzymes. Transcript levels of amine oxidase copper-containing 1 (Aoc1), an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of putrescine, were barely detectable by in situ mRNA hybridization in healthy kidneys. Aoc1 was highly expressed upon various experimental kidney injuries resulting in a significant reduction of kidney putrescine content. Kidney levels of spermine were also significantly reduced, whereas spermidine was increased in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Increased Aoc1 expression in injured kidneys was mainly accounted for by an Aoc1 isoform that harbors 22 additional amino acids at its N-terminus and shows increased secretion. Mice with germline deletion of Aoc1 and injured kidneys showed no decrease of kidney putrescine content; although they displayed no overt phenotype, they had fewer tubular casts upon ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hyperosmotic stress stimulated AOC1 expression at the transcriptional and post-transcription levels in metanephric explants and kidney cell lines. AOC1 expression was also significantly enhanced after kidney transplantation in humans. These data demonstrate that the kidneys respond to various forms of injury with down-regulation of polyamine synthesis and activation of the polyamine breakdown pathway. Thus, an imbalance in kidney polyamines may contribute to various etiologies of kidney injury.","['Aoc1', 'kidney injury', 'mRNA in situ hybridization', 'osmotic stress', 'polyamines', 'putrescine']",2022-01-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37121383,Limb Remote Ischemic Postconditioning Improves Glymphatic Dysfunction After Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Delayed neuronal damage can be caused or aggravated after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Recent studies have shown that glymphatic system dysfunction after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury is involved in ischemic brain edema and neuroinflammation, thereby regulating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes of glymphatic system after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and whether limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP) can improve the function of glymphatic system to protect the brain.To establish a focal brain I/R injury mouse model, this study utilized the middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) method. The present study classified eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice into three groups. The changes in glymphatic function in different periods of ischemia and reperfusion were analyzed through immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Western-Blot (WB) assays. The contents of the evaluation included cerebrospinal fluid flow, swelling degree of brain tissue, aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression and polarization, and amyloid-β (Aβ) excretion.In the early stages of cerebral ischemia, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow is disturbed, accompanied by a decrease in AQP4 polarization. The polarity of AQP4 decreased from 12 h to 72 h of reperfusion, the Aβ deposition. LRIP can increase the expression of β-DG and AQP4 polarization, reduce the deposition of Aβ, improve the function of the glymphatic system, and reduce the expression of AQP4 to play A protective role in brain.Glymphatic system impaired after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice. LRIP may play a neuroprotective role by improving glymphatic function after I/R.","['amyloid-β', 'aquaporin-4', 'extracellular volume', 'ischemic brain edema', 'polarization']",2022-12-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37121121,PDGFRB upregulation contributes to retinal damages in the rat model of retinal ischemia-reperfusion.,"Retinal ischemic disease is a major type of retinal diseases causing vision loss. Identifying the molecular mechanisms mediating the retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) is the key to targeted intervention. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis of the retinal tissues of a retinal ischemia-reperfusion model of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, followed by differential gene expression analysis, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. After studying we found that: The major biological processes affected after RIR was the regulation of vascular development. PPI analysis unveiled a regulatory module in which Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta (PDGFRB) was upregulated. In the RIR cell model of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRCEC) induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R), silencing PDGFRB at least partially rescued the detrimental effect on cell proliferation and in vitro angiogenic ability. In the rat model of RIR, the administration of PDGFR inhibitor alleviated the damages in the retinal microvascular system. Besides, we further demonstrated the protective effect of procyanidin against RIR induced damages in both the cell and animal model by dampening the overexpression of PDGFRB. Together, our data indicate that the upregulation of PDGFRB contributes to RIR-induced damages in retinal microvascular system, which provides a targetable strategy for therapeutic intervention.","['HRCEC', 'PDGFRB', 'Procyanidin', 'Protein-protein interaction', 'Retinal ischemia-reperfusion']",2023-02-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37121061,Jasminoidin and ursodeoxycholic acid exert synergistic effect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via Dectin-1-induced NF-κB activation pathway.,"Jasminoidin (JA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UA) were shown to act synergistically against ischemic stroke (IS) in our previous studies.To investigate the holistic synergistic mechanism of JA and UA on cerebral ischemia.Middle cerebral artery obstruction reperfusion (MCAO/R) mice were used to evaluate the efficacy of JA, UA, and JA combined with UA (JU) using neurological function testing and infarct volume examination. High-throughput RNA-seq combined with computational prediction and function-integrated analysis was conducted to gain insight into the comprehensive mechanism of synergy. The core mechanism was validated using western blotting.JA and UA synergistically reduced cerebral infarct volume and alleviated neurological deficits and pathological changes in MCAO/R mice. A total of 1437, 396, 1080, and 987 differentially expressed genes were identified in the vehicle, JA, UA, and JU groups, respectively. A strong synergistic effect between JA and UA was predicted using chemical similarity analysis, target profile comparison, and semantic similarity analysis. As the 'long-tail' drugs, the top 20 gene ontology (GO) biological processes of JA, UA, and JU groups primarily reflected inflammatory response and regulation of cytokine production, with specific GO terms of JU revealing enhanced regulation on immune response and tumor necrosis factor superfamily cytokine production. Comparably, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling of common targets of JA, UA, and JU focused on extracellular matrix organization and signaling by interleukins, immune system, phagosomes, and lysosomes, which interlock and interweave to produce the synergistic effects of JU. The characteristic signaling pathway identified for JU highlighted the crosstalk between autophagy activation and inflammatory pathways, especially the Dectin-1-induced NF-κB activation pathway, which was validated by in vivo experiments.JA and UA can synergistically protect cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating Dectin-1-induced NF-κB activation. The strategy integrating high throughput data with computational models enables ever-finer mapping of 'long-tail' drugs to dynamic variations in condition-specific omics to clarify synergistic mechanisms.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Inflammation', 'Jasminoidin', 'Synergistic effect', 'Ursodeoxycholic acid']",2023-01-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37120600,Effect of remote ischemic conditioning on the immune-inflammatory profile in patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock in a randomized controlled trial.,"Resuscitation induced ischemia/reperfusion predisposes trauma patients to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. We investigated the effect of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), a treatment shown to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury in experimental models of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation, on the systemic immune-inflammatory profile in trauma patients in a randomized trial. We conducted a prospective, single-centre, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving trauma patients sustaining blunt or penetrating trauma in hemorrhagic shock admitted to a Level 1 trauma centre. Patients were randomized to receive RIC (four cycles of 5-min pressure cuff inflation at 250 mmHg and deflation on the thigh) or a Sham intervention. The primary outcomes were neutrophil oxidative burst activity, cellular adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of myeloperoxidase, cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood samples, drawn at admission (pre-intervention), 1 h, 3 h, and 24 h post﻿-admission. Secondary outcomes included ventilator, ICU and hospital free days, incidence of nosocomial infections, 24 h and 28 day mortality. 50 eligible patients were randomized; of which 21 in the Sham group and 18 in the RIC group were included in the full analysis. No treatment effect was observed between Sham and RIC groups for neutrophil oxidative burst activity, adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of myeloperoxidase and cytokines. RIC prevented significant increases in Th2 chemokines﻿ TARC/CCL17 (P < 0.01) and MDC/CCL22 (P < 0.05) at 24 h post-intervention in comparison to the Sham group. Secondary clinical outcomes were not different between groups. No adverse events in relation to the RIC intervention were observed. Administration of RIC was safe and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes. While trauma itself modified several immunoregulatory markers, RIC failed to alter expression of the majority of markers. However, RIC may influence Th2 chemokine expression in the post resuscitation period. Further investigation into the immunomodulatory effects of RIC in traumatic injuries and their impact on clinical outcomes is warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02071290.",[],2023-01-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37120006,Indole-3-carbinol mitigates oxidative stress and inhibits inflammation in rat cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model.,"Ischemia is a significant pathogenetic factor of stroke with very limited treatment options. The objective of our research was to evaluate the protective properties of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its effect on redox status parameters, inflammation, and apoptosis intensity in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) in rats. I3C administration to CIRI rats decreased levels of oxidative stress markers and improved aerobic metabolism compared to the animals with CIRI. A decrease in myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokines mRNA levels, and expression of redox-sensitive factor Nuclear Factor-κB was observed in rats with CIRI that received I3C. I3C-treated rats with pathology showed decreased caspase activity and apoptosis-inducing factor expression, compared to the animals in the CIRI group. Obtained data indicate that I3C has a neuroprotective and anti-ischemic effect in CIRI that may be related to its antioxidant properties and ability to reduce the inflammatory response and apoptosis.","['Apoptosis', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'Indole-3-carbinol', 'Inflammation', 'Nuclear factor κB', 'Oxidative stress']",2023-01-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37119961,Dolphin leukocytes exhibit an attenuated cytokine response and increase heme oxygenase activity upon exposure to lipopolysaccharides.,"Cetaceans exhibit physiological adaptations that allowed the transition to aquatic life, including a robust antioxidant defense system that prevents injury from repeated exposure to ischemia/reperfusion events associated with breath-hold diving. The signaling cascades that characterize ischemic inflammation in humans are well characterized. In contrast, cetaceans' molecular and biochemical mechanisms that confer tolerance to inflammatory events are poorly understood. Heme oxygenase (HO) is a cytoprotective protein with anti-inflammatory properties. HO catalyzes the first step in the oxidative degradation of heme. The inducible HO-1 isoform is regulated by various stimuli, including hypoxia, oxidant stress, and inflammatory cytokines. The objective of this study was to compare the response of HO-1 and cytokines to a proinflammatory challenge in leukocytes isolated from humans and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We measured changes in HO activity, and abundance and expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) in leukocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 and 48 h. HO activity increased (p < 0.05) in dolphin (48 h) but not human cells. TNF-α expression increased in human (24 h, 48 h), but not dolphin cells following LPS stimulation. LPS-induced cytokine expression was lower in dolphin than in human leukocytes, suggesting a blunted cytokine response in bottlenose dolphin leukocytes treated with LPS. Results suggest species-specific regulation of inflammatory cytokines in leukocytes treated with LPS, which may lead to differential responses to a pro-inflammatory challenge between marine and terrestrial mammals.","['Diving', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Marine mammals']",2022-10-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37119852,"An evolving view of complex II-noncanonical complexes, megacomplexes, respiration, signaling, and beyond.","Mitochondrial complex II is traditionally studied for its participation in two key respiratory processes: the electron transport chain and the Krebs cycle. There is now a rich body of literature explaining how complex II contributes to respiration. However, more recent research shows that not all of the pathologies associated with altered complex II activity clearly correlate with this respiratory role. Complex II activity has now been shown to be necessary for a range of biological processes peripherally related to respiration, including metabolic control, inflammation, and cell fate. Integration of findings from multiple types of studies suggests that complex II both participates in respiration and controls multiple succinate-dependent signal transduction pathways. Thus, the emerging view is that the true biological function of complex II is well beyond respiration. This review uses a semichronological approach to highlight major paradigm shifts that occurred over time. Special emphasis is given to the more recently identified functions of complex II and its subunits because these findings have infused new directions into an established field.","['Krebs cycle', 'bacterial chemotaxis', 'cancer metabolism', 'complex II', 'hypoxia', 'inflammation', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'paraganglioma', 'pheochromocytoma', 'respirasome', 'reverse electron transfer', 'succinate dehydrogenase', 'succinate signaling']",2023-03-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37119387,Intermittent Hypoxic Preconditioning Plays a Cardioprotective Role in Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiomyopathy.,"Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning (IHP) is a well-established cardioprotective intervention in models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Nevertheless, the significance of IHP in different cardiac pathologies remains elusive. In order to investigate the role of IHP and its effects on calcium-dependent signalization in HF, we employed a model of cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a widely used drug from the class of cardiotoxic antineoplastics, which was i.p. injected to Wistar rats (4 applications of 4 mg/kg/week). IHP-treated group was exposed to IHP for 2 weeks prior to Dox administration. IHP ameliorated Dox-induced reduction in cardiac output. Western blot analysis revealed increased expression of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) while the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1-α, which is a crucial regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes, was not changed. Animals administered with Dox had further decreased expression of TRPV1 and TRPV4 (transient receptor potential, vanilloid subtype) ion channels along with suppressed Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. In summary, IHP-mediated improvement in cardiac output in the model of Dox-induced cardiomyopathy is likely a result of increased SERCA2a expression which could implicate IHP as a potential protective intervention in Dox cardiomyopathy, however, further analysis of observed effects is still required.","['Cardioprotection', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Contractility', 'Doxorubicin', 'Hypoxia']",2022-03-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37119287,Broadening horizons: The role of ferroptosis in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Ferroptosis is a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD) discovered in recent years, where abnormal intracellular iron accumulation leads to the onset of lipid peroxidation, which further leads to the disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis and triggers cell death. Iron accumulation with lipid peroxidation is considered a hallmark of ferroptosis that distinguishes it from other RCDs. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a process of increased myocardial cell injury that occurs during coronary reperfusion after myocardial ischemia and is associated with high post-infarction mortality. Multiple experiments have shown that ferroptosis plays an important role in MIRI pathophysiology. This review systematically summarized the latest research progress on the mechanisms of ferroptosis. Then we report the possible link between the occurrence of MIRI and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Finally, we discuss and analyze the related drugs that target ferroptosis to attenuate MIRI and its action targets, and point out the shortcomings of the current state of relevant research and possible future research directions. It is hoped to provide a new avenue for improving the prognosis of the acute coronary syndrome.","['Ferroptosis', 'Iron accumulation', 'Lipid peroxidation', 'Mitochondria', 'Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury']",2023-03-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37119279,Protective and pathogenic functions of innate lymphoid cells in transplantation.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a family of lymphocytes with essential roles in tissue homeostasis and immunity. Along with other tissue resident immune populations, distinct subsets of ILCs have important roles in either promoting or inhibiting immune tolerance in a variety of contexts, including cancer and autoimmunity. In solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, both donor and recipient derived ILCs could contribute to immune tolerance or rejection, yet understanding of protective or pathogenic functions are only beginning to emerge. In addition to roles in directing or regulating immune responses, ILCs interface with parenchymal cells to support tissue homeostasis and even regeneration. Whether specific ILCs are tissue-protective or enhance ischemia reperfusion injury or fibrosis is of particular interest to the field of transplantation, beyond any roles in limiting or promoting allograft rejection or graft-versus host disease. Within this review, we discuss the current understanding of ILCs functions in promoting immune tolerance and tissue repair at homeostasis and in the context of transplantation, and highlight where targeting or harnessing ILCs could have applications in novel transplant therapies.","['Natural Killer cells', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplant', 'immune regulation', 'immune tolerance', 'innate lymphoid cells', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'rejection', 'transplantation']",2023-02-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Effective prevention and treatment therapies for II/R are clinically necessary. 6-Shogaol (6-SG), the main active ingredient in dried ginger, behaviors multiple biological activities, including anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-apoptosis. This study aims to elucidate the protective effects and mechanism of 6-SG against II/R-induced injury.Sprague-Dawley rats are pre-treated orally with 6-SG and subjected to II/R injury by clamping superior mesenteric artery for 1 h and reperfusion for 2 h. Caco-2 cells are challenged by hypoxia/reoxygenation to mimic II/R in vitro. 6-SG pre-treatment protects against II/R injury by reducing intestinal morphological damage and intestinal barrier injury via inhibiting cell apoptosis. Network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses reveal that 6-SG has a high affinity with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) formed homodimer or heterodimer with NT4 instead of the monomer, and thus the dimer configuration is stabilized, activating BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inhibiting II/R-induced cell apoptosis. The outcome is further validated both in vivo and in vitro.6-Shogaol protects against II/R injury by inhibiting cell apoptosis through the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/AKT pathway.

37118873,Geraniol protects hippocampal CA1 neurons and improves functional outcomes in global model of stroke in rats.,"Geraniol (GE), an acyclic monoterpene, is a chief constituent of essential oils of herbs and fruits. It possesses diverse pharmacological actions like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-parkinson. However, its neuroprotective potential in stroke is yet to be explored at large. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective potential of GE against the global model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury in rats. Bilateral common carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion for 30 min followed by 7 days of reperfusion caused varied biochemical/enzymatic alterations viz. increase in levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), xanthine oxidase (XO), and decrease in the levels of cerebroprotectives like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total thiols, and glutathione (GSH). GE-pretreatment markedly reversed these changes and restored the levels of protective enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants near to normal compared to I/R group. Besides, GE treatment showed marked improvement in anxiety-related behavior and neuronal deficits in animals subjected to I/R injury. Moreover, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained rat brain coronal sections and histopathological studies revealed neuronal protection against I/R-injury, as evidenced by a reduction in infarct area (%) and an increase in hippocampal CA1 neuronal density in the GE-treated groups. The results of this study revealed that GE exhibited potential neuroprotective activity by reducing oxidative stress and infarction area, and protecting hippocampal CA1 neurons against I/R-injury in the global stroke model in rats.","['cerebrovascular diseases', 'geraniol', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'neuroprotection', 'oxidative stress', 'stroke']",2023-01-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

An in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) neuronal cell model was established and pretreated with liensinine or rapamycin (RAPA). Cell proliferation and survival were detected using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, while cell damage and apoptosis were detected using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage rate and flow cytometry. Autophagy activity was detected using monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. Thereafter, I/R models were established in vivo in rats and the presence of neurological deficits was examined. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to detect pathological damage in brain tissue and the volume ratio of the cerebral infarction. The levels of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins and autophagy-related proteins (mTOR, LC3, P62, and TSC2) were detected using Western blot. The findings showed that liensinine treatment increased cell viability, decreased cell injury and apoptosis, and inhibited autophagy. The addition of RAPA to promote autophagy inhibited cell viability and enhanced cell injury and apoptosis. The I/R rats in the model group exhibited deficient neurological function, while those in the liensinine treatment group showed restoration of normal neural function and reduction of the necrotic area and infarct volume ratio in the brain tissue. Furthermore, liensinine treatment also inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway activity and autophagy. However, addition of RAPA reversed the effects of liensinine treatment and aggravated brain tissue injury. Therefore, liensinine can play a neuroprotective role in CIRI by inhibiting autophagy through regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.","['Autophagy', 'Ischemia–reperfusion', 'Liensinine', 'Nerve injury', 'PI3K/Akt signaling pathway']",2023-02-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37116559,Activated neutrophil-derived exosomes contribute to blood-brain barrier damage and hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) caused by blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is closely correlated with the poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. Neutrophils are proven to mediate BBB injury after ischemic stroke, but the mechanism remains to be further investigated. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the effect of neutrophil-derived exosomes on BBB integrity.A tMCAO-HT model was constructed to assess neutrophil infiltration and its co-localization with brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). After using quiet (Q-Neu) and activated neutrophil (A-Neu) and their exosomes to treat the BBB model in vitro, TEER and permeability were assayed to assess the BBB integrity. Small RNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) in A-Neu- and Q-Neu-derived exosomes, and the function and pathways of DE-miRNA targets were analyzed by GO and KEGG enrichment.Different degrees of cerebral hemorrhage were observed in the tMCAO-HT model. The expression of the neutrophil marker Ly6G was significantly increased in tMCAO-HT model compared to the sham group, and co-localized with the BMEC marker CD31. Notably, Ly6G expression was positively correlated with hemoglobin content in brain tissue. A-Neu and its derived exosomes reduced TEER and elevated permeability in the BBB model in vitro. Moreover, BBB-related proteins Claudin 5, Occludin and ZO-1 expression were significantly reduced in BMEC after treatment with A-Neu and its derived exosomes. Nevertheless, Q-Neu and its exosomes had no significant effect on BBB integrity. A total of 84 DE-miRNAs are present in Q-Neu- and A-Neu-derived exosomes, and their target genes are involved in the regulation of ""positive regulation of establishment of endothelial barrier"", ""cell junction"", ""ECM-receptor interaction"" and ""VEGF signaling pathway"". Moreover, RT-qPCR revealed that the expression trends of miR-409-3p, miR-6909-5p, miR-3473d, miR-370-3p and miR-6904-5p in exosomes were consistent with the sequencing results.Neutrophils are abnormally recruited in HT after ischemic stroke, and are associated with cerebral hemorrhage. In vitro, A-Neu-derived exosomes facilitate BBB injury, which may be accomplished by exosomal transport of miRNAs.","['Blood brain barrier', 'Exosome', 'Hemorrhagic transformation', 'Ischemic stroke', 'MicroRNA', 'Neutrophil']",2023-03-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37116256,"Redox and metal profiles in human coronary endothelial and smooth muscle cells under hyperoxia, physiological normoxia and hypoxia: Effects of NRF2 signaling on intracellular zinc.","Zinc is an important component of cellular antioxidant defenses and dysregulation of zinc homeostasis is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Intracellular homeostasis of metals, such as zinc, iron and calcium are interrelated with cellular responses to oxidative stress. Most cells experience significantly lower oxygen levels in vivo (2-10 kPa O2) compared to standard in vitro cell culture (18kPa O2). We report the first evidence that total intracellular zinc content decreases significantly in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), but not in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC), after lowering of O2 levels from hyperoxia (18 kPa O2) to physiological normoxia (5 kPa O2) and hypoxia (1 kPa O2). This was paralleled by O2-dependent differences in redox phenotype based on measurements of glutathione, ATP and NRF2-targeted protein expression in HCAEC and HCASMC. NRF2-induced NQO1 expression was attenuated in both HCAEC and HCASMC under 5 kPa O2 compared to 18 kPa O2. Expression of the zinc efflux transporter ZnT1 increased in HCAEC under 5 kPa O2, whilst expression of the zinc-binding protein metallothionine (MT) decreased as O2 levels were lowered from 18 to 1 kPa O2. Negligible changes in ZnT1 and MT expression were observed in HCASMC. Silencing NRF2 transcription reduced total intracellular zinc under 18 kPa O2 in HCAEC with negligible changes in HCASMC, whilst NRF2 activation or overexpression increased zinc content in HCAEC, but not HCASMC, under 5 kPa O2. This study has identified cell type specific changes in the redox phenotype and metal profile in human coronary artery cells under physiological O2 levels. Our findings provide novel insights into the effect of NRF2 signaling on Zn content and may inform targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases.","['Coronary artery endothelial cells', 'Coronary artery smooth muscle cells', 'HIF-1α', 'HO-1', 'Human coronary artery', 'Hyperoxia', 'Hypoxia', 'ICP-MS', 'LA-ICP-MS', 'Metallomics', 'Metallothionein', 'Metals', 'NQO1', 'NRF2', 'Oxygen', 'Physiological normoxia', 'Redox status', 'Zn', 'ZnT1']",2023-03-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37115470,Therapeutic effects of a standardized-flavonoid Diospyros kaki L.f. leaf extract on transient focal cerebral ischemia-induced brain injury in mice.,"This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and therapeutic effects of Diospyros kaki L.f. leaves (DK) on transient focal cerebral ischemic injury and underlying mechanisms using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of mice. The animals received the MCAO operation on day 0. The daily administrations of DK (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o) and edaravone (6 mg/kg, i.v), a reference drug with radical scavenging activity, were started 7 days before (pre-treatment) or immediately after the MCAO operation (post-treatment) and continued during the experimental period. Histochemical, biochemical, and neurological changes and cognitive performance were evaluated. MCAO caused cerebral infarction and neuronal cell loss in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus in a manner accompanied by spatial cognitive deficits. These neurological and cognitive impairments caused by MCAO were significantly attenuated by pre- and post-ischemic treatments with DK and edaravone, suggesting that DK, like edaravone, has therapeutic potential for cerebral ischemia-induced brain damage. DK and edaravone suppressed MCAO-induced changes in biomarkers for apoptosis (TUNEL-positive cell number and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression) and oxidative stress (glutathione and malondialdehyde contents) in the brain. Interestingly, DK, but not edaravone, mitigated an increase in blood-brain permeability and down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression caused by MCAO. Although the exact chemical constituents implicated in the effects of DK remain to be clarified, the present results indicate that DK exerts neuroprotective and therapeutic activity against transient focal cerebral ischemia-induced injury probably by suppressing oxidative stress, apoptotic process, and mechanisms impairing blood-brain barrier integrity in the brain.","['Anti-apoptosis', 'Blood–brain barrier', 'Cerebral ischemia', 'Diospyros kaki L.f.', 'Neuroprotective effect']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37114963,Loss of lncRNA UCA1 ameliorates the injury managed by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by sponging miR-18a-5p.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality in the clinic. The current experiments aimed to study the effects of UCA1 interfering miR-18a-5p on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI/R).For rat models undergoing middle cerebral artery infarction (MCAO) surgery, the expression of UCA1 and miR-18a-5p was evaluated by qRT-PCR, and underlying function was identified by detecting infarct size, neurological scores, and inflammation. Luciferase report was applied to verify the relationship between UCA1 and miR-18a-5p. In the cell models, the impacts of UCA1 and miR-18a-5p were validated by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, and ELISA. In patients with AIS, Pearson correlation was carried out to unveil the association between UCA1 and miR-18a-5p.The expression of UCA1 was at high levels and miR-18a-5p was at low levels in AIS patients. UCA1 knockdown showed a protective role in infarct size, neurofunction, and inflammation via binding miR-18a-5p. MiR-18a-5p participated in the regulation of UCA1 on cell viability, cell apoptosis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and inflammation. In patients with AIS, overexpression of UCA1 and underexpression of miR-18a-5p had a reverse correlation.Elimination of UCA1 was favourable to the recovery of the rat model and cells from CI/R damage by efficaciously sponging miR-18a-5p.","[' cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', ' inflammation', ' miR-18a-5p', ' neurofunction', 'UCA1']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h followed by reperfusion. The experimental rats were divided into five groups: a sham, or control group; vehicle group; and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg bodyweight isosakuranetin-treated I/R groups. After 24 h of reperfusion, the rats were tested using a six-point neurological function score. The percentage of cerebral infarction was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. BBB leakage was determined by Evan Blue injection assay and brain morphology changes were observed under light microscopy following staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The results of neurological function score revealed that isosakuranetin reduced the severity of neurological damage. A dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg bodyweight of isosakuranetin significantly decreased the infarct volume. All three doses of isosakuranetin significantly decreased Evan Blue leakage. The penumbra area of the I/R brains revealed the characteristics of apoptotic cell death. Therefore, isosakuranetin-treated I/R attenuated the brain damage from cerebral I/R injury and further investigation of the mechanisms warrant further investigation to assist in the development of protective strategies against cerebral I/R injury in clinical trials.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

37111367,Asialo-rhuEPO as a Potential Neuroprotectant for Ischemic Stroke Treatment.,"Neuroprotective drugs to protect the brain against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury are urgently needed. Mammalian cell-produced recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPOM) has been demonstrated to have excellent neuroprotective functions in preclinical studies, but its neuroprotective properties could not be consistently translated in clinical trials. The clinical failure of rhuEPOM was thought to be mainly due to its erythropoietic activity-associated side effects. To exploit its tissue-protective property, various EPO derivatives with tissue-protective function only have been developed. Among them, asialo-rhuEPO, lacking terminal sialic acid residues, was shown to be neuroprotective but non-erythropoietic. Asialo-rhuEPO can be prepared by enzymatic removal of sialic acid residues from rhuEPOM (asialo-rhuEPOE) or by expressing human EPO gene in glycoengineered transgenic plants (asialo-rhuEPOP). Both types of asialo-rhuEPO, like rhuEPOM, displayed excellent neuroprotective effects by regulating multiple cellular pathways in cerebral I/R animal models. In this review, we describe the structure and properties of EPO and asialo-rhuEPO, summarize the progress on neuroprotective studies of asialo-rhuEPO and rhuEPOM, discuss potential reasons for the clinical failure of rhuEPOM with acute ischemic stroke patients, and advocate future studies needed to develop asialo-rhuEPO as a multimodal neuroprotectant for ischemic stroke treatment.","['asialo-erythropoietin', 'cerebral ischemia and reperfusion', 'clinical trial', 'erythropoietin', 'erythropoietin receptor', 'hematopoietic activity', 'multimodal neuroprotectant', 'non-erythropoiesis', 'preclinical study']",2023-03-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37111249,"Effects of Apocynin, a NADPH Oxidase Inhibitor, in the Protection of the Heart from Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.","Ischemia and perfusion (I/R) induce inflammation and oxidative stress, which play a notable role in tissue damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) in the protection of the heart from I/R injury. Hearts isolated from Wistar rats (n = 8 per group) were perfused with a modified Langendorff preparation. Left ventricular (LV) contractility and cardiovascular hemodynamics were evaluated by a data acquisition program, and infarct size was evaluated by 2,3,5-Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Furthermore, the effect of apocynin on the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) was evaluated using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hearts were subjected to 30 min of regional ischemia, produced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Hearts were infused with apocynin before ischemia, during ischemia or at reperfusion. To understand the potential pathways of apocynin protection of the heart, a nitric oxide donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP), nitric oxide blocker (N (gamma)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-Name), nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) inhibiter (Ned-K), cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) agonist, or CD38 blocker (Thiazoloquin (az)olin (on)e compound, 78c) was infused with apocynin. Antioxidants were evaluated by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity. Apocynin infusion before ischemia or at reperfusion protected the heart by normalizing cardiac hemodynamics and decreasing the infarct size. Apocynin treatment resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant levels. Apocynin infusion protected the heart by improving LV hemodynamics and coronary vascular dynamics. This treatment decreased the infarct size and inflammatory cytokine levels and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine and antioxidant levels. This protection follows a pathway involving CD38, nitric oxide and acidic stores.","['CD38', 'NAADP', 'NOX', 'apocynin', 'ischemia/reperfusion']",2023-02-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37110816,Procyanidins Alleviated Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting Ferroptosis via the Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway.,"Procyanidins (PCs), which are organic antioxidants, suppress oxidative stress, exhibit anti-apoptotic properties, and chelate metal ions. The potential defense mechanism of PCs against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) was investigated in this study. Pre-administration for 7 days of a PC enhanced nerve function and decreased cerebellar infarct volume in a mouse middle cerebral artery embolization paradigm. In addition, mitochondrial ferroptosis was enhanced, exhibited by mitochondrial shrinkage and roundness, increased membrane density, and reduced or absent ridges. The level of Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation that cause ferroptosis was significantly reduced by PC administration. According to the Western blot findings, PCs altered the expression of proteins associated with ferroptosis, promoting the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11 while reducing the expression of TFR1, hence inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, the treatment of PCs markedly elevated the expression of HO-1 and Nuclear-Nrf2. The PCs' ability to prevent ferroptosis due to CIRI was decreased by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. Our findings showed that the protective effect of PCs may be achieved via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting ferroptosis. This study provides a new perspective on the treatment of CIRI with PCs.","['Nrf2/HO−1pathway', 'cerebral', 'ferroptosis', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'mice', 'procyanidins']",2023-03-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37109544,Overexpression of a Short Sulfonylurea Splice Variant Increases Cardiac Glucose Uptake and Uncouples Mitochondria by Regulating ROMK Activity.,"The mitochondrial splice variant of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2A-55) is associated with protection from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, increased mitochondrial ATP sensitive K+ channel activity (mitoKATP) and altered glucose metabolism. While mitoKATP channels composed of CCDC51 and ABCB8 exist, the mitochondrial K+ pore regulated by SUR2A-55 is unknown. We explored whether SUR2A-55 regulates ROMK to form an alternate mitoKATP. We assessed glucose uptake in mice overexpressing SUR2A-55 (TGSUR2A-55) compared with WT mice during IR injury. We then examined the expression level of ROMK and the effect of ROMK modulation on mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in WT and TGSUR2A-55 mice. TGSUR2A-55 had increased glucose uptake compared to WT mice during IR injury. The expression of ROMK was similar in WT compared to TGSUR2A-55 mice. ROMK inhibition hyperpolarized resting cardiomyocyte Δψm from TGSUR2A-55 mice but not from WT mice. In addition, TGSUR2A-55 and ROMK inhibitor treated WT isolated cardiomyocytes had enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling. ROMK inhibition blocked diazoxide induced Δψm depolarization and prevented preservation of Δψm from FCCP perfusion in WT and to a lesser degree TGSUR2A-55 mice. In conclusion, cardio-protection from SUR2A-55 is associated with ROMK regulation, enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling and increased glucose uptake.","['KATP channel', 'mitoKATP', 'myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury', 'renal outer medullary potassium channel', 'sulfonylurea receptor']",2023-01-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37109276,Impact of Hyperoxia after Graft Reperfusion on Lactate Level and Outcomes in Adults Undergoing Orthotopic Liver Transplantation.,"Hyperoxia is common during liver transplantation (LT), without being supported by any guidelines. Recent studies have shown the potential deleterious effect of hyperoxia in similar models of ischemia-reperfusion. Hyperoxia after graft reperfusion during orthotopic LT could increase lactate levels and worsen patient outcomes.We conducted a retrospective and monocentric pilot study. All adult patients who underwent LT from 26 July 2013 to 26 December 2017 were considered for inclusion. Patients were classified into two groups according to oxygen levels before graft reperfusion: the hyperoxic group (PaO2 > 200 mmHg) and the nonhyperoxic group (PaO2 < 200 mmHg). The primary endpoint was arterial lactatemia 15 min after graft revascularization. Secondary endpoints included postoperative clinical outcomes and laboratory data.A total of 222 liver transplant recipients were included. Arterial lactatemia after graft revascularization was significantly higher in the hyperoxic group (6.03 ± 4 mmol/L) than in the nonhyperoxic group (4.81 ± 2 mmol/L), p < 0.01. The postoperative hepatic cytolysis peak, duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ileus were significantly increased in the hyperoxic group.In the hyperoxic group, the arterial lactatemia, the hepatic cytolysis peak, the mechanical ventilation and the postoperative ileus were higher than in the nonhyperoxic group, suggesting that hyperoxia worsens short-term outcomes and could lead to increase ischemia-reperfusion injury after liver transplantation. A multicenter prospective study should be performed to confirm these results.","['hyperoxia', 'ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'lactate level', 'liver transplantation']",2023-02-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37109017,The Role of LincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/Autophagy Pathway in the Neuroprotection Process by Hydrogen against OGD/R-Induced Hippocampal HT22 Cells Injury.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury causes high disability and mortality. Hydrogen (H2) enhances tolerance to an announced ischemic event; however, the therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of CI/R injury remain uncertain. Long non-coding RNA lincRNA-erythroid prosurvival (EPS) (lincRNA-EPS) regulate various biological processes, but their involvement in the effects of H2 and their associated underlying mechanisms still needs clarification. Herein, we examine the function of the lincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/autophagy pathway in the neuroprotection of H2 against CI/R injury. HT22 cells and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model were used to mimic CI/R injury in vitro. H2, 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor), and RAPA (an autophagy agonist) were then administered, respectively. Autophagy, neuro-proinflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that H2 attenuated HT22 cell injury, which would be confirmed by the improved cell survival rate and decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, H2 remarkably improved cell injury after OGD/R insult via decreasing pro-inflammatory factors, as well as suppressing apoptosis. Intriguingly, the protection of H2 against neuronal OGD/R injury was abolished by rapamycin. Importantly, the ability of H2 to promote lincRNA-EPS and Sirt1 expression and inhibit autophagy were abrogated by the siRNA-lincRNA-EPS. Taken together, the findings proved that neuronal cell injury caused by OGD/R is efficiently prevented by H2 via modulating lincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/autophagy-dependent pathway. It was hinted that lincRNA-EPS might be a potential target for the H2 treatment of CI/R injury.","['HT22 cells', 'LincRNA-EPS', 'OGD/R', 'Sirt1', 'autophagy', 'hydrogen']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37109010,"Effects of Dexmedetomidine on Immunomodulation and Pain Control in Videolaparoscopic Cholecystectomies: A Randomized, Two-Arm, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Digital and robotic technology applications in laparoscopic surgery have revolutionized routine cholecystectomy. Insufflation of the peritoneal space is vital for its safety but comes at the cost of ischemia-reperfusion-induced intraabdominal organ compromise before the return of physiologic functions. Dexmedetomidine in general anesthesia promotes controlling the response to trauma by altering the neuroinflammatory reflex. This strategy may improve clinical outcomes in the postoperative period by reducing postoperative narcotic use and lowering the risk of subsequent addiction. In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate dexmedetomidine's therapeutic and immunomodulatory potential on perioperative organ function.Fifty-two patients were randomized 1:1: group A-sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine (dexmedetomidine infusion [1 µg/kg loading, 0.2-0.5 µg/kg/h maintenance dose]), and group B-sevoflurane with saline 0.9% infusion as a placebo control. Three blood samples were collected: preoperatively (T0 h), 4-6 h after surgery (T4-6 h), and 24 h postoperatively (T24 h). The primary outcome was the level analysis of inflammatory and endocrine mediators. Secondary outcome measures were the time to return to normal preoperative hemodynamic parameters, spontaneous ventilation, and postoperative narcotic requirements to control surgical pain.A reduction of Interleukin 6 was found at 4-6 h after surgery in group A with a mean of 54.76 (27.15-82.37; CI 95%) vs. 97.43 (53.63-141.22); p = 0.0425) in group B patients. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were lower in group A patients, who also had a statistically significantly lower opioid consumption in the first postoperative hour when compared to group B patients (p < 0.0001). We noticed a similar return to spontaneous ventilation pattern in both groups.Dexmedetomidine decreased interleukin-6 4-6 h after surgery, likely by providing a sympatholytic effect. It provides good perioperative analgesia without respiratory depression. Implementing dexmedetomidine during laparoscopic cholecystectomy has a good safety profile and may lower healthcare expenditure due to faster postoperative recovery.","['dexmedetomidine', 'immunomodulation', 'laparoscopic cholecystectomy']",2023-01-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37108659,Nanoparticle-Based Interventions for Liver Transplantation.,"Liver transplantation is the only treatment for hepatic insufficiency as a result of acute and chronic liver injuries/pathologies that fail to recover. Unfortunately, there remains an enormous and growing gap between organ supply and demand. Although recipients on the liver transplantation waitlist have significantly higher mortality, livers are often not allocated because they are (i) classified as extended criteria or marginal livers and (ii) subjected to longer cold preservation time (>6 h) with a direct correlation of poor outcomes with longer cold ischemia. Downregulating the recipient's innate immune response to successfully tolerate a graft having longer cold ischemia times or ischemia-reperfusion injury through induction of immune tolerance in the graft and the host would significantly improve organ utilization and post-transplant outcomes. Broadly, technologies proposed for development aim to extend the life of the transplanted liver through post-transplant or recipient conditioning. In this review, we focus on the potential benefits of nanotechnology to provide unique pre-transplant grafting and recipient conditioning of extended criteria donor livers using immune tolerance induction and hyperthermic pre-conditioning.","['hyperthermia', 'liver transplant', 'nanoparticles', 'tolerance']",2023-02-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37108494,Simultaneous Inhibition of Thrombosis and Inflammation Is Beneficial in Treating Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in acute coronary syndromes is a condition in which ischemic/hypoxic injury to cells subtended by the occluded vessel continues despite successful resolution of the thrombotic obstruction. For decades, most efforts to attenuate IRI have focused on interdicting singular molecular targets or pathways, but none have successfully transitioned to clinical use. In this work, we investigate a nanoparticle-based therapeutic strategy for profound but local thrombin inhibition that may simultaneously mitigate both thrombosis and inflammatory signaling pathways to limit myocardial IRI. Perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (PFC NP) were covalently coupled with an irreversible thrombin inhibitor, PPACK (Phe[D]-Pro-Arg-Chloromethylketone), and delivered intravenously to animals in a single dose prior to ischemia reperfusion injury. Fluorescent microscopy of tissue sections and 19F magnetic resonance images of whole hearts ex vivo demonstrated abundant delivery of PFC NP to the area at risk. Echocardiography at 24 h after reperfusion demonstrated preserved ventricular structure and improved function. Treatment reduced thrombin deposition, suppressed endothelial activation, inhibited inflammasome signaling pathways, and limited microvascular injury and vascular pruning in infarct border zones. Accordingly, thrombin inhibition with an extraordinarily potent but locally acting agent suggested a critical role for thrombin and a promising therapeutic strategy in cardiac IRI.","['PPACK', 'acute myocardial infarction', 'fluorine magnetic resonance imaging', 'fluorine magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'inflammasome', 'inflammation', 'perfluorocarbon nanoparticles', 'thrombosis']",2023-02-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37108268,The Duration of Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation (OGD) Determines the Effects of Subsequent Reperfusion on Rat Pheochromocytoma (PC12) Cells and Primary Cortical Neurons.,"Reperfusion is the fundamental treatment for ischaemic stroke; however, many ischaemic stroke patients cannot undergo reperfusion treatment. Furthermore, reperfusion can cause ischaemic reperfusion injuries. This study aimed to determine the effects of reperfusion in an in vitro ischaemic stroke model-oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) (0.3% O2)-with rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cortical neurons. In PC12 cells, OGD resulted in a time-dependent increase in cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and reduction in MTT activity from 2 h onwards. Reperfusion following shorter periods (4 and 6 h) of OGD recovered apoptotic PC12 cells, whereas after 12 h, OGD increased LDH release. In primary neurons, 6 h OGD led to significant increase in cytotoxicity, reduction in MTT activity and dendritic MAP2 staining. Reperfusion following 6 h OGD increased the cytotoxicity. HIF-1a was stabilised by 4 and 6 h OGD in PC12 cells and 2 h OGD onwards in primary neurons. A panel of hypoxic genes were upregulated by the OGD treatments depending on the duration. In conclusion, the duration of OGD determines the mitochondrial activity, cell viability, HIF-1a stabilization, and hypoxic gene expression in both cell types. Reperfusion following OGD of short duration is neuroprotective, whereas OGD of long duration is cytotoxic.","['HIF', 'OGD', 'PC12 cell', 'duration', 'neuron', 'rat', 'reperfusion']",2023-03-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37107928,The Use of Cardioprotective Devices and Strategies in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Procedures and Cardiac Surgery.,"In the United States, about one million people are seen to visit the operating theater for cardiac surgery annually. However, nearly half of these visits result in complications such as renal, neurological, and cardiac injury of varying degrees. Historically, many mechanisms and approaches have been explored in attempts to reduce injuries associated with cardiac surgery and percutaneous procedures. Devices such as cardioplegia, mechanical circulatory support, and other methods have shown promising results in managing and preventing life-threatening cardiac-surgery-related outcomes such as heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Comparably, cardioprotective devices such as TandemHeart, Impella family devices, and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) have also been proven to show significant cardioprotection through mechanical support. However, their use as interventional agents in the prevention of hemodynamic changes due to cardiac surgery or percutaneous interventions has been correlated with adverse effects. This can lead to a rebound increased risk of mortality in high-risk patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Further research is necessary to delineate and stratify patients into appropriate cardioprotective device groups. Furthermore, the use of one device over another in terms of efficacy remains controversial and further research is necessary to assess device potential in different settings.

37107296,Mitofilin Heterozygote Mice Display an Increase in Myocardial Injury and Inflammation after Ischemia/Reperfusion.,"Mitochondrial inner membrane protein (Mitofilin/Mic60) is part of a big complex that constituent the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS), which plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function. We recently showed that Mitofilin physically binds to Cyclophilin D, and disruption of this interaction promotes the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and determines the extent of I/R injury. Here, we investigated whether Mitofilin knockout in the mouse enhances myocardial injury and inflammation after I/R injury. We found that full-body deletion (homozygote) of Mitofilin induces a lethal effect in the offspring and that a single allele expression of Mitofilin is sufficient to rescue the mouse phenotype in normal conditions. Using non-ischemic hearts from wild-type (WT) and Mitofilin+/- (HET) mice, we report that the mitochondria structure and calcium retention capacity (CRC) required to induce the opening of mPTP were similar in both groups. However, the levels of mitochondrial dynamics proteins involved in both fusion/fission, including MFN2, DRP1, and OPA1, were slightly reduced in Mitofilin+/- mice compared to WT. After I/R, the CRC and cardiac functional recovery were reduced while the mitochondria structure was more damaged, and myocardial infarct size was increased in Mitofilin+/- mice compared to WT. Mitofilin+/- mice exhibited an increase in the mtDNA release in the cytosol and ROS production, as well as dysregulated SLC25As (3, 5, 11, and 22) solute carrier function, compared to WT. In addition, Mitofilin+/- mice displayed an increase in the transcript of pro-inflammatory markers, including IL-6, ICAM, and TNF-α. These results suggest that Mitofilin knockdown induces mitochondrial cristae damage that promotes dysregulation of SLC25As solute carriers, leading to an increase in ROS production and reduction in CRC after I/R. These effects are associated with an increase in the mtDNA release into the cytosol, where it activates signaling cascades leading to nuclear transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines that aggravate I/R injury.","['Mitofilin/Mic60', 'SLC25As solute carriers', 'cGas/STING/p-p65 pathway', 'inflammatory markers', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'mPTP opening', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'mitochondrial calcium retention capacity', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2023-01-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37107270,"Reverse Electron Transport at Mitochondrial Complex I in Ischemic Stroke, Aging, and Age-Related Diseases.","Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A main cause of brain damage by stroke is ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury due to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and energy failure caused by changes in mitochondrial metabolism. Ischemia causes a build-up of succinate in tissues and changes in the mitochondrial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) activity that promote reverse electron transfer (RET), in which a portion of the electrons derived from succinate are redirected from ubiquinol along complex I to reach the NADH dehydrogenase module of complex I, where matrix NAD+ is converted to NADH and excessive ROS is produced. RET has been shown to play a role in macrophage activation in response to bacterial infection, electron transport chain reorganization in response to changes in the energy supply, and carotid body adaptation to changes in the oxygen levels. In addition to stroke, deregulated RET and RET-generated ROS (RET-ROS) have been implicated in tissue damage during organ transplantation, whereas an RET-induced NAD+/NADH ratio decrease has been implicated in aging, age-related neurodegeneration, and cancer. In this review, we provide a historical account of the roles of ROS and oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, summarize the latest developments in our understanding of RET biology and RET-associated pathological conditions, and discuss new ways to target ischemic stroke, cancer, aging, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases by modulating RET.","['Alzheimer’s disease (AD)', 'FOXO', 'NAD+/NADH ratio', 'RET inhibitor', 'aging', 'cancer', 'mitochondrial complex I', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'reverse electron transport (RET)', 'sirtuin']",2023-03-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37107258,Acute Kidney Injury Induces Oxidative Stress and Hepatic Lipid Accumulation through AMPK Signaling Pathway.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) often impairs the function of other organs leading to distant organ injury. The liver is the major organ that regulates metabolism and lipid homeostasis in the body. It has been reported that AKI causes liver injury with increased oxidative stress, inflammatory response and steatosis. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI caused hepatic lipid accumulation. Kidney ischemia (45 min)-reperfusion (24 h) led to a significant increase in plasma creatinine and transaminase in Sprague Dawley rats, indicating kidney and liver injury. Histological and biochemical analyses revealed hepatic lipid accumulation with a significant elevation of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the liver. This was accompanied by a decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, indicating the reduced activation of AMPK, which is an energy sensor that regulates lipid metabolism. The expression of AMPK-regulated genes that were responsible for fatty acid oxidation (CPTIα, ACOX) was significantly decreased, while the expression of lipogenesis genes (SREPB-1c, ACC1) was significantly elevated. The oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde was elevated in the plasma and liver. Incubation of HepG2 cells with an oxidative stress inducer hydrogen peroxide inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and caused cellular lipid accumulation. This was accompanied by decreased expression of genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation and increased expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis. These results suggest that AKI elicits hepatic lipid accumulation through decreased fatty acid metabolism and increased lipogenesis. Oxidative stress may contribute, in part, to the downregulation of the AMPK signaling pathway leading to hepatic lipid accumulation and injury.","['AKI', 'AMPK', 'fatty liver', 'lipid', 'oxidative stress']",2023-03-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37107227,Effects of Resveratrol on Vascular Function in Retinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) events are involved in the development of various ocular pathologies, e.g., retinal artery or vein occlusion. We tested the hypothesis that resveratrol is protective against I/R injury in the murine retina. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated in anaesthetized mice to 110 mm Hg for 45 min via a micropipette placed in the anterior chamber to induce ocular ischemia. In the fellow eye, which served as control, IOP was kept at a physiological level. One group received resveratrol (30 mg/kg/day p.o. once daily) starting one day before the I/R event, whereas the other group of mice received vehicle solution only. On day eight after the I/R event, mice were sacrificed and retinal wholemounts were prepared and immuno-stained using a Brn3a antibody to quantify retinal ganglion cells. Reactivity of retinal arterioles was measured in retinal vascular preparations using video microscopy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) were quantified in ocular cryosections by dihydroethidium and anti-3-nitrotyrosine staining, respectively. Moreover, hypoxic, redox and nitric oxide synthase gene expression was quantified in retinal explants by PCR. I/R significantly diminished retinal ganglion cell number in vehicle-treated mice. Conversely, only a negligible reduction in retinal ganglion cell number was observed in resveratrol-treated mice following I/R. Endothelial function and autoregulation were markedly reduced, which was accompanied by increased ROS and RNS in retinal blood vessels of vehicle-exposed mice following I/R, whereas resveratrol preserved vascular endothelial function and autoregulation and blunted ROS and RNS formation. Moreover, resveratrol reduced I/R-induced mRNA expression for the prooxidant enzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2). Our data provide evidence that resveratrol protects from I/R-induced retinal ganglion cell loss and endothelial dysfunction in the murine retina by reducing nitro-oxidative stress possibly via suppression of NOX2 upregulation.","['arterioles', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'reactive oxygen species', 'resveratrol', 'retina']",2023-02-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37107169,Release of High-Mobility Group Box-1 after a Raynaud's Attack Leads to Fibroblast Activation and Interferon-γ Induced Protein-10 Production: Role in Systemic Sclerosis Pathogenesis.,"Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP) leading to repetitive ischemia and reperfusion (IR) stress, is the first recognizable sign of systemic sclerosis (SSc) leading to increased oxidative stress. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear factor released by apoptotic and necrotic cells after oxidative stress. Since HMGB1 can signal through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), we investigated whether an RP attack promotes the release of HMGB1, leading to fibroblast activation and the upregulation of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes. A cold challenge was performed to simulate an RP attack in patients with SSc, primary RP (PRP), and healthy controls. We measured levels of HMGB1 and IFN gamma-induced Protein 10 (IP-10) at different time points in the serum. Digital perfusion was assessed by photoplethysmography. In vitro, HMGB1 or transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) (as control) was used to stimulate healthy human dermal fibroblasts. Inflammatory, profibrotic, and IFN-inducible genes, were measured by RT-qPCR. In an independent cohort, sera were obtained from 20 patients with SSc and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls to determine HMGB1 and IP-10 levels. We found that HMGB1 levels increased significantly 30 min after the cold challenge in SSc compared to healthy controls. In vitro stimulation with HMGB1 resulted in increased mRNA expression of IP-10, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) while TGF-β1 stimulation promoted IL-6 and Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF). In serum, both HMGB1 and IP-10 levels were significantly higher in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls. We show that cold challenge leads to the release of HMGB1 in SSc patients. HMGB1 induces IP-10 expression in dermal fibroblasts partly through the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) axis suggesting a link between RP attacks, the release of HMGB1 and IFN-induced proteins as a putative early pathogenetic mechanism in SSc.","['HMGB1', 'IP-10', 'RAGE', 'Raynaud’s phenomenon', 'SSc', 'injury', 'ischemia and reperfusion']",2023-03-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37107167,"An Electrophysiological and Proteomic Analysis of the Effects of the Superoxide Dismutase Mimetic, MnTMPyP, on Synaptic Signalling Post-Ischemia in Isolated Rat Hippocampal Slices.","Metabolic stress and the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two main contributors to neuronal damage and synaptic plasticity in acute ischemic stroke. The superoxide scavenger MnTMPyP has been previously reported to have a neuroprotective effect in organotypic hippocampal slices and to modulate synaptic transmission after in vitro hypoxia and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). However, the mechanisms involved in the effect of this scavenger remain elusive. In this study, two concentrations of MnTMPyP were evaluated on synaptic transmission during ischemia and post-ischemic synaptic potentiation. The complex molecular changes supporting cellular adaptation to metabolic stress, and how these are modulated by MnTMPyP, were also investigated. Electrophysiological data showed that MnTMPyP causes a decrease in baseline synaptic transmission and impairment of synaptic potentiation. Proteomic analysis performed on MnTMPyP and hypoxia-treated tissue indicated an impairment in vesicular trafficking mechanisms, including reduced expression of Hsp90 and actin signalling. Alterations of vesicular trafficking may lead to reduced probability of neurotransmitter release and AMPA receptor activity, resulting in the observed modulatory effect of MnTMPyP. In OGD, protein enrichment analysis highlighted impairments in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as TGFβ1 and CDKN1B signalling, in addition to downregulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and an increased expression of CAMKII. Taken together, our results may indicate modulation of neuronal sensitivity to the ischemic insult, and a complex role for MnTMPyP in synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially providing molecular insights into the mechanisms mediating the effects of MnTMPyP during ischemia.","['EPSP', 'MnTMPyP', 'hippocampus', 'hypoxia', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'oxidative stress', 'oxygen–glucose deprivation', 'proteomics', 'superoxide dismutase', 'synaptic plasticity', 'synaptic transmission']",2023-02-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37106099,Spontaneous reperfusion enhances succinate concentration in peripheral blood from stemi patients but its levels does not correlate with myocardial infarct size or area at risk.,"Succinate is enhanced during initial reperfusion in blood from the coronary sinus in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients and in pigs submitted to transient coronary occlusion. Succinate levels might have a prognostic value, as they may correlate with edema volume or myocardial infarct size. However, blood from the coronary sinus is not routinely obtained in the CathLab. As succinate might be also increased in peripheral blood, we aimed to investigate whether peripheral plasma concentrations of succinate and other metabolites obtained during coronary revascularization correlate with edema volume or infarct size in STEMI patients. Plasma samples were obtained from peripheral blood within the first 10 min of revascularization in 102 STEMI patients included in the COMBAT-MI trial (initial TIMI 1) and from 9 additional patients with restituted coronary blood flow (TIMI 2). Metabolite concentrations were analyzed by 1H-NMR. Succinate concentration averaged 0.069 ± 0.0073 mmol/L in patients with TIMI flow ≤ 1 and was significantly increased in those with TIMI 2 at admission (0.141 ± 0.058 mmol/L, p < 0.05). However, regression analysis did not detect any significant correlation between most metabolite concentrations and infarct size, extent of edema or other cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) variables. In conclusion, spontaneous reperfusion in TIMI 2 patients associates with enhanced succinate levels in peripheral blood, suggesting that succinate release increases overtime following reperfusion. However, early plasma levels of succinate and other metabolites obtained from peripheral blood does not correlate with the degree of irreversible injury or area at risk in STEMI patients, and cannot be considered as predictors of CMR variables.Trial registration: Registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02404376) on 31/03/2015.

37105981,Exploiting synergistic effect of CO/NO gases for soft tissue transplantation using a hydrogel patch.,"Autologous skin flap transplantation is a common method for repairing complex soft tissue defects caused by cancer, trauma, and congenital malformations. Limited blood supply range and post-transplantation ischemia-reperfusion injury can lead to distal necrosis of the flap and long-term functional loss, which severely restricts the decision-making regarding the optimal surgical plan. To address this issue, we develop a hydrogel patch that releases carbon monoxide and nitric oxide gases on demand, to afford a timely blood supply for skin flap transplantation during surgery. Using an ischemia-reperfusion dorsal skin flap model in rats, we show that the hydrogel patch maintains the immediate opening of blood flow channels in transplanted tissue and effective blood perfusion throughout the perioperative period, activating perfusion of the hemodynamic donor site. We demonstrate that the hydrogel patch promotes distal vascularization and long-term functional reconstruction of transplanted tissues by inhibiting inflammatory damage and accelerating blood vessel formation.",[],2022-05-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Although for some horses with a strangulating obstruction, the need for surgery is made based on severe colic signs or lack of response to analgesia, in other horses, it is less obvious. Signalment, history, and meticulous physical examination, combined with some targeted diagnostic procedures can help with early diagnosis of intestinal strangulation.

To determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we utilized the R package ""limma"". We also identify the infiltration of different immune cells through single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Furthermore, we utilized LASSO logistic regression to select feature genes and Spearman's rank correlation analysis to determine the correlation between these genes and infiltrating immune cells. Finally, the significance of these feature genes was confirmed using a mouse model of hepatic IRI.A total of 17 DEGs were acquired, most of which were associated with inflammation, apoptosis, cell proliferation, immune disorders, stress response, and angiogenesis. 28 immune cell types were determined using ssGSEA. 5 feature genes (ADM, KLF6, SERPINE1, SLC20A1, and HBB) were screened using LASSO analysis, but the HBB gene was ultimately excluded due to the lack of statistical significance in the GSE151648 dataset. These 4 feature genes were predominantly related to immune cells. Finally, 15 significantly distinctive types of immune cells between the control and IRI groups were verified.We unveiled that macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), neutrophils, CD4 T cells, and other immune cells infiltrated the IRI that occurred after LT. Moreover, we identified ADM, KLF6, SERPINE1, and SLC20A1 as potential biological biomarkers underlying IRI post-transplant, which may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of this condition.","['Bioinformatics', 'Immunity', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia and reperfusion injury', 'Liver transplantation']",2023-02-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37105418,Sodium thiosulfate refuels the hepatic antioxidant pool reducing ischemia-reperfusion-induced liver injury.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a critical liver condition during hepatic transplantation, trauma, or shock. An ischemic deprivation of antioxidants and energy characterizes liver injury in such cases. In the face of increased reactive oxygen production, hepatocytes are vulnerable to the reperfusion driving ROS generation and multiple cell-death mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the importance of hydrogen sulfide as part of the liver's antioxidant pool and the therapeutic potency of the hydrogen sulfide donors sodium sulfide (Na2S, fast releasing) and sodium thiosulfate (STS, Na2S2O3, slow releasing). The mitoprotection and toxicity of STS and Na2S were investigated on isolated mitochondria and a liver perfusion oxidative stress model by adding text-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen sulfide donors. The respiratory capacity of mitochondria, hepatocellular released LDH, glutathione, and lipid-peroxide levels were quantified. In addition, wild-type and cystathionine-γ-lyase knockout mice were subjected to warm selective ischemia-reperfusion injury by clamping the main inflow for 1 h followed by reperfusion of 1 or 24 h. A subset of animals was treated with STS shortly before reperfusion. Glutathione, plasma ALT, and lipid-peroxide levels were investigated alongside mitochondrial changes in structure (electron microscopy) and function (intravital microscopy). Liver tissue necrosis quantified 24 h after reperfusion indicates the net effects of the treatment on the organ. STS refuels and protects the endogenous antioxidant pool during liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, STS-mediated ROS scavenging significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage, resulting in better molecular and histopathological preservation of the liver tissue architecture. STS prevents tissue damage in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing the liver's antioxidant pool, thereby protecting mitochondrial integrity.","['Antioxidants', 'Hydrogen sulfide', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Liver', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Sodium thiosulfate']",2023-03-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37105127,Effects of different doses of dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole on neurobehaviors and changes of mitochondrial membrane potentials in rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"To explore the effects of different doses of dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole on neurobehaviors and changes of mitochondrial membrane potential in rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.A total of 75 SPF Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly divided into sham group (n=20), model group (n=20), pramipexole administration group (n=35). The rat model of global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was prepared by the modified Pulsinelli's four-vessel occlusion method. Pramipexole administration group was administered intraperitoneally in rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury at different doses of pramipexole 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, once a day for 14 consecutive days. Based on the results of modified neurological severity scores, open field test and morphology by Nissl's staining to determine the optimal dose of pramipexole. Mitochondrial membrane potential in the optimal dose of pramipexole administration group were measured by the JC-1 fluorescent probe staining method.1. Different doses of pramipexole 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 2 mg/kg, were used as drug administration in rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury for 14 consecutive days, and we found that all four doses of pramipexole could improve the modified neurological severity scores of rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury to varying degrees, but only 0.5 mg/kg pramipexole at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days consistently reduced modified neurological severity scores and improved neurological function in rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. In the open-field test, only 0.5 mg/kg pramipexole increased the number of entries into the central zone, duration spent in the central zone, total distance travelled in the open field and average velocity, which improved the spontaneous activities and reduced anxiety and depression of rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. 2. Different doses of pramipexole 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 2 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days significantly increased the number of surviving neurons in the hippocampal CA1 subfield in rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury to varying degrees. Based on these results, we tentatively found that 0.5 mg/kg pramipexole may be the optimal dose in all of the above. 3. We found that 0.5 mg/kg pramipexole significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential in rats after global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.Different doses of dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole improved neurological function of rats with global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury to varying degrees, and 0.5 mg/kg pramipexole may be the optimal dose in all of the above.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of MCE after successful reperfusion.We retrospectively analyzed consecutive ischemic stroke patients who underwent EVT in our institution from November 2015 to April 2022. Patients who failed to achieve successful reperfusion (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction [mTICI]<2b) were excluded. Based on multivariate logistic models, the best-fit monogram was established. The discriminative performance was assessed by the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC).A total of 307 patients were included and 48 (15.6%) were diagnosed with MCE after successful reperfusion. Patients with MCE after successful reperfusion had a lower 3-month favorable outcome (15.2% versus 59.6%; p<0.001), a lower 3-month good outcome (17.4% versus 68.4%; p<0.001), and a higher rate of mortality at 3-month (54.3% versus 8.8%; p<0.001) compared with patients without MCE. Predictors of MCE after successful reperfusion included admission glucose level, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, stroke etiology, occlusion site and puncture-to-reperfusion (PTR) time>120 min. The area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram was 0.805 (95% CI, 0.756-0.847).MCE after successful reperfusion is associated with poor outcome and mortality.

However, the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation are limited by the low survival and differentiation rates of NSCs due to the harsh environment in the brain after ischemic stroke. Here, we employed NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells together with exosomes extracted from NSCs to treat cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion in mice. The results showed that NSC-derived exosomes significantly reduced the inflammatory response, alleviated oxidative stress after NSC transplantation, and facilitated NSCs differentiation in vivo. The combination of NSCs with exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarction, neuronal death, and glial scarring, and promoted the recovery of motor function. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of NSC-derived exosomes and the potential downstream genes. Our study provided the rationale for the clinical application of NSC-derived exosomes as a supportive adjuvant for NSC transplantation after stroke.","['combination treatment', 'exosome', 'mouse', 'neural stem cell', 'neuroscience', 'stroke']",2022-10-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The goal of this study was to determine the overlap in AKI miRNA profiles in the renal cortex, urine, and plasma samples collected from a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI. Bilateral renal ischemia was induced by clamping the renal pedicles for 30 min, followed by reperfusion. Urine was then collected over 24 h, followed by terminal blood and tissue collection for small RNA profiling. Differentially expressed (IR vs. sham) miRs within the urine and renal cortex sample types demonstrated a strong correlation in normalized abundance regardless of injury (IR and sham: R2 = 0.8710 and 0.9716, respectively). Relatively few miRs were differentially expressed in multiple samples. Further, there were no differentially expressed miRs with clinically relevant sequence conservation common between renal cortex and urine samples. This project highlights the need for a comprehensive analysis of potential miR biomarkers, including analysis of pathological tissues and biofluids, with the goal of identifying the cellular origin of altered miRs. Analysis at earlier timepoints is needed to further evaluate clinical potential.","['liquid biopsy', 'microRNAs', 'renal ischemia']",2023-02-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, whether the protective effects are through mediating the programmed cell death is yet to be fully elucidated.In vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model was established in HT22 cells and mouse cortical neurons. Subsequently, ALDH2 expression were assessed by qRT-PCR and western blot. The methylation status was examined by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR). Then, ALDH2 expression was promoted and suppressed to explore the role of ALDH2 in OGD/R-treated cells. CCK-8 assay was applied to detect cell viability, and flow cytometry was applied to evaluate cell apoptosis. Western blot was applied to detect the apoptosis-related proteins (Caspase 3, Bcl-2 and Bax), necroptosis-related proteins (RIP3 and MLKL), pyroptosis-related proteins (NLRP3 and GSDMD), ferroptosis-related protein (ACSL4 and GPX4), and autophagy-related proteins (LC3B, and p62). IL-1β and IL-18 production was evaluated by ELISA assay. Reactive oxygen species production and Fe2+ content were evaluated by the corresponding detection kit.In OGD/R-treated cells, ALDH2 expression was decreased, which was due to the hypermethylation of ALDH2 in the promoter region. ALDH2 overexpression improved cell viability and ALDH2 knockdown suppressed cell viability in OGD/R-treated cells. We also found that ALDH2 overexpression attenuated OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and autophagy, while ALDH2 knockdown facilitated the OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and autophagy.Collectively, our results implied that ALDH2 attenuated OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and autophagy to promote cell viability in HT22 cells and mouse cortical neurons.","['ALDH2', 'Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Ferroptosis', 'Oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation', 'Pyroptosis']",2022-11-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a potentially useful technique to protect distant organs from the damage induced by ischemia. RIC has been verified as effective to protect against NEC; however, its mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to assess the mechanism and efficacy of RIC to treat experimental NEC in mice. Between postnatal day (P) 5 and P9, we induced NEC in C57BL/6 mice and Grx1-/- mice. Intermittent occlusion of the blood flow to the right hind limb for 4 cycles of 5 min ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion during NEC induction on P6 and P8 was used to apply RIC. We sacrificed the mice on p9 and evaluated oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, proliferation, apoptosis, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway in mice ileal tissue. RIC decreased intestinal injury and prolonged survival in NEC pups. RIC significantly inhibited inflammatory, attenuated oxidative stress, reduced apoptosis, promoted proliferation, and activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR in vivo. RIC activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to control oxidative stress and inflammation. RIC might provide a new therapeutic strategy for NEC.","['PI3K', 'glutaredoxin-1', 'inflammation', 'necrotizing enterocolitis', 'redox', 'remote ischemic conditioning']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37102996,NLRP3 Inflammasome-Targeting Nanomicelles for Preventing Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Inflammatory Injury.,"Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a disease process that affects several vital organs. There is widespread agreement that the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway plays a crucial role in the development of I/R injury. We have developed transferrin-conjugated, pH-responsive nanomicelles for the entrapment of MCC950 drug. These nanomicelles specifically bind to the transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expressed on the cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thus help the cargo to cross the BBB. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of nanomicelles was assessed using in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo models of I/R injury. Nanomicelles were injected into the common carotid artery (CCA) of a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model to achieve maximum accretion of nanomicelles into the brain as blood flows toward the brain in the CCA. The current study reveals that the treatment with nanomicelles significantly alleviates the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome biomarkers which were found to be increased in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated SH-SY5Y cells, the I/R-damaged right vitelline artery (RVA) of chick embryos, and the MCAO rat model. The supplementation with nanomicelles significantly enhanced the overall survival of MCAO rats. Overall, nanomicelles exerted therapeutic effects against I/R injury, which might be due to the suppression of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.","['NLRP3 inflammasome', 'chick embryo', 'ischemia−reperfusion injury', 'middle cerebral artery occlusion', 'oxygen−glucose deprivation', 'transferrin-conjugated polymeric nanomicelles']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37102684,"The protective effect of H151, a novel STING inhibitor, in renal ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury.","Renal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common renal functional disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) is the cytosolic DNA-activated signaling pathway that mediates inflammation and injury. Our recent study showed that extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP), a newly identified damage-associated molecular pattern, activates STING and exacerbates hemorrhagic shock. H151 is a small molecule that selectively binds to STING and inhibits STING-mediated activity. We hypothesized that H151 attenuates eCIRP-induced STING activation in vitro and inhibits RIR-induced AKI in vivo. In vitro, renal tubular epithelial cells incubated with eCIRP showed increased levels of IFN-β, STING pathway downstream cytokine, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, whereas coincubation with eCIRP and H151 diminished those increases in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, 24 h after bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion, glomerular filtration rate was decreased in RIR-vehicle-treated mice, whereas glomerular filtration rate was unchanged in RIR-H151-treated mice. In contrast to sham, serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were increased in RIR-vehicle, but in RIR-H151, these levels were significantly decreased from RIR-vehicle. In contrast to sham, kidney IFN-β mRNA, histological injury score, and TUNEL staining were also increased in RIR-vehicle, but in RIR-H151, these levels were significantly decreased from RIR-vehicle. Importantly, in contrast to sham, in a 10-day survival study, survival decreased to 25% in RIR-vehicle, but RIR-H151 had a survival of 63%. In conclusion, H151 inhibits eCIRP-induced STING activation in renal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, STING inhibition by H151 can be a promising therapeutic intervention for RIR-induced AKI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Renal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common renal functional disorder with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is the cytosolic DNA-activated signaling pathway responsible for mediating inflammation and injury.

37101626,EEF1A2 accelerates the protein translation of chemokine in rat myocardial cells induced by ischemia-reperfusion.,"How to reduce the damage caused by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in a timely manner to save patients' lives is still a great clinical challenge. Although dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been reported to protect the myocardium, the regulatory mechanism of gene translation responding to IR injury and DEX protection is poorly understood. In this study, IR rat model with DEX and the antagonist yohimbine (YOH) pretreatment were established, and RNA sequencing was carried out to seek the important regulators in differential expressed genes. A series of cytokines and chemokine as well as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (EEF1A2) were induced by IR compared to control and compromised by DEX pretreatment compared to IR, then reversed by YOH. Immunoprecipitation was conducted to identify that peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) interacted with EEF1A2 and contributed to the recruitment of EEF1A2 on mRNA molecules of cytokines and chemokine. Knockdown of PRDX1 could weaken the enhancive effect of EEF1A2 for gene translation of IL6, CXCL2 and CXCL11 under the IR condition, and indeed reduce cell apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. We also determined that the RNA motif ""USCAGDCU"" at 5' UTR could be particularly recognized by PRDX1. Destruction of this motif at the 5' UTR of IL6, CXCL2 and CXCL11 by CRISPR-CAS9 could result in the loss occupancies of EEF1A2 and PRDX1 on the mRNA of these three genes. Our observations showed the importance of PRDX1 in the reasonable control of cytokine and chemokine expression to prevent excessive inflammatory response to cell damage.","['Chemokine', 'Cytokine', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'EEF1A2', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion', 'PRDX1']",2023-02-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, whether TENS can be an effective intervention in the acute stage of ischemic stroke still remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore whether TENS could alleviate brain infarct volume, reduce oxidative stress and neuronal pyroptosis, and activate mitophagy following ischemic stroke.TENS was performed at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in rats for 3 consecutive days. Neurological scores, the volume of infarction, and the activity of SOD, MDA, GSH, and GSH-px were measured. Moreover, western blot was performed to detect the related protein expression, including Bcl-2, Bax, TXNIP, GSDMD, caspase-1, NLRP3, BRCC3, HIF-1α, BNIP3, LC3, and P62. Real-time PCR was performed to detect NLRP3 expression. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect the levels of LC3.There was no significant difference of neurological deficit scores between the MCAO group and the TENS group at 2 h after MCAO/R operation (P > 0.05), while the neurological deficit scores of TENS group significantly decreased in comparison with MCAO group at 72 h following MACO/R injury (P < 0.05). Similarly, TENS treatment significantly reduced the brain infarct volume compared with the MCAO group (P < 0.05). Moreover, TENS decreased the expression of Bax, TXNIP, GSDMD, caspase-1, BRCC3, NLRP3, and P62 and the activity of MDA as well as increasing the level of Bcl-2, HIF-1α, BNIP3, and LC3 and the activity of SOD, GSH, and GSH-px (P < 0.05).In conclusion, our results indicated that TENS alleviated brain damage following ischemic stroke via inhibiting neuronal oxidative stress and pyroptosis and activating mitophagy, possibly via the regulation of TXNIP, BRCC3/NLRP3, and HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathways.",[],2022-08-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This type of SWI injury is more severe in transplanted organs more sensitive to temperature changes. This study aimed to present the newly developed OrganPocket, an organ protector made from a proprietary elastomer material, and to demonstrate its efficacy in mitigating SWI injury in clinical kidney transplantation.We used an ex vivo porcine organ model to evaluate OrganPocket. After removal, donor organs were immersed and cryopreserved in an organ preservation solution at 4°C before being placed in an OrganPocket. The organ graft and OrganPocket were held for 30 minutes in a 37°C environment mimicking intra-abdominal conditions while temperatures were recorded. Control organs were evaluated under the same conditions without an OrganPocket. In addition, we tested OrganPocket in an intra-abdominal porcine allograft transplant model.The control organ group temperature reached ≥16°C after 30 minutes, while the mean core temperature in the OrganPocket organ group remained at no more than 10°C. Despite an SWI time of approximately 30 minutes, the surface organ temperature upon removal of OrganPocket was 20°C. Cardiac grafts also exhibited a normal heartbeat after reperfusion.OrganPocket is the world's first device designed to prevent SWI and should also prove useful for heart transplantation.",[],2023-03-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37100110,SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin alleviates intramyocardial hemorrhage and adverse ventricular remodeling via suppressing hepcidin in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH), a reperfusion therapy-associated complication, is the extravasation of red blood cells caused by severe microvascular injury. IMH is an independent predictor of adverse ventricular remodeling (AVR) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Hepcidin, a major regulator of iron uptake and systemic distribution, is a key factor affecting AVR. However, the role of cardiac hepcidin in the development of IMH has not been completely elucidated. This study aimed to explore if sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) exerts therapeutic effects on IMH and AVR by suppressing hepcidin and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. SGLT2i alleviated IMH and AVR in the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mouse model. Additionally, SGLT2i downregulated the cardiac levels of hepcidin in IRI mice, suppressed M1-type macrophage polarization, and promoted M2-type macrophage polarization. The effects of hepcidin knockdown on macrophage polarization were similar to those of SGLT2i in RAW264.7 cells. SGLT2i treatment or hepcidin knockdown inhibited the expression of MMP9, an inducer of IMH and AVR, in RAW264.7 cells. Regulation of macrophage polarization and reduction of MMP9 expression by SGLT2i and hepcidin knockdown is achieved through activation of pSTAT3. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SGLT2i alleviated IMH and AVR by regulating macrophage polarization. The potential mechanism through which SGLT2i exerted its therapeutic effect seems to involve the downregulation of MMP9 via the hepcidin-STAT3 pathway.","['Hepcidin', 'Intramyocardial hemorrhage', 'MMP9', 'Macrophage polarization', 'Sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor']",2022-12-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37099675,Tailored Apoptotic Vesicle Delivery Platform for Inflammatory Regulation and Tissue Repair to Ameliorate Ischemic Stroke.,"Apoptotic vesicles (ApoVs) hold great promise for inflammatory regulation and tissue repair. However, little effort has been dedicated to developing ApoV-based drug delivery platforms, while the insufficient targeting capability of ApoVs also limits their clinical applications. This work presents a platform architecture that integrates apoptosis induction, drug loading, and functionalized proteome regulation, followed by targeting modification, enabling the creation of an apoptotic vesicle delivery system to treat ischemic stroke. Briefly, α-mangostin (α-M) was utilized to induce mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) apoptosis while being loaded onto MSC-derived ApoVs as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Matrix metalloproteinase activatable cell-penetrating peptide (MAP), a microenvironment-responsive targeting peptide, was modified on the surface of ApoVs to obtain the MAP-functionalized α-M-loaded ApoVs. Such engineered ApoVs targeted the injured ischemic brain after systemic injection and achieved an enhanced neuroprotective activity due to the synergistic effect of ApoVs and α-M. The internal protein payloads of ApoVs, upon α-M activation, were found engaged in regulating immunological response, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation, all of which contributed to the therapeutic effects of ApoVs. The findings provide a universal framework for creating ApoV-based therapeutic drug delivery systems for the amelioration of inflammatory diseases and demonstrate the potential of MSC-derived ApoVs to treat neural injury.","['apoptotic vesicles', 'extracellular vesicles', 'ischemic stroke', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'tissue repair', 'α-mangostin']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The neuroprotective properties of SRT2104 administration have been proven in central nervous system degeneration diseases through the activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase-silence information regulator 1 (Sirt1). Here, we investigated whether SRT2104 could protect the retina from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanisms.SRT2104 was intravitreally injected immediately after I/R induction. RNA and protein expression were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Protein expression and distribution were examined by immunofluorescence staining. Retinal structure and function were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, optical coherence tomography, and electroretinogram. Optic nerve axons were quantified using toluidine blue staining. Cellular apoptosis and senescence were evaluated by TUNEL assay and SA-β-gal staining.The protein expression of Sirt1 decreased dramatically after I/R injury and SRT2104 administration effectively enhanced the stability of Sirt1 protein without significantly influencing Sirt1 mRNA synthesis. SRT2104 administration alone exerted no influence on the structure and function of normal retinas. However, SRT2104 intervention significantly protected the inner retinal structure and neurons; partially restored retinal function after I/R injury. I/R-induced cellular apoptosis and senescence were effectively alleviated by SRT2104 administration. Additionally, SRT2104 intervention markedly reduced neuroinflammation, including reactive gliosis, retinal vascular inflammation, and the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines after I/R injury. Mechanistically, I/R-induced acetylation of p53, NF-κB p65, and STAT3 was significantly reversed by SRT2104 intervention.We demonstrated that SRT2104 exerted potent protective effects against I/R injury by enhancing Sirt1-mediated deacetylation and suppressing apoptosis, senescence, and neuroinflammation-related pathways.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37098925,Protective effect of Guanxin Danshen formula on myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury in rats.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) leads to myocardial tissue necrosis, which will increase the size of myocardial infarction. The study examined the protective effect and mechanism of the Guanxin Danshen formula (GXDSF) on MIRI in rats.MIRI model was performed in rats; rat H9C2 cardiomyocytes were hypoxia-reoxygenated to establish a cell injury model.The GXDSF significantly reduced myocardial ischemia area, reduced myocardial structural injury, decreased the levels of interleukin (IL-1β, IL-6) in serum, decreased the activity of myocardial enzymes, increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione in rats with MIRI. The GXDSF can reduce the expression of nucleotide- binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP3), IL-1β, caspase-1, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) in myocardial tissue cells. Salvianolic acid B and notoginsenoside R1 protected H9C2 cardiomyocytes from hypoxia and reoxygenation injury and reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-6 in the cell supernatant, decreasing the NLRP3, IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1, and GSDMD expression in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. GXDSF can reduce the myocardial infarction area and alleviate the damage to myocardial structure in rats with MIRI, which may be related to the regulation of the NLRP3.GXDSF reduces MIRI in rat myocardial infarction injury, improves structural damage in myocardial ischemia injury, and reduces myocardial tissue inflammation and oxidative stress by lowering inflammatory factors and controlling focal cell death signaling pathways.",[],2022-09-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37098317,MK-886 protects against cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion injury by activating proteasome-Keap1-NRF2 signalling.,"Oxidative stress is considered a key factor contributing to the initiation and development of cardiac injury following ischaemia‒reperfusion (I/R). Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is a rate-limiting enzyme for leukotriene biosynthesis. MK-886 is an inhibitor of ALOX5 that exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, the significance of MK-886 in preventing I/R-mediated cardiac injury and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Cardiac I/R model was produced by ligation/release of the left anterior descending artery. MK-886 (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally into mice at 1 and 24 h before I/R. Our results indicated that MK-886 treatment significantly attenuated I/R-mediated cardiac contractile dysfunction and decreased the infarct area, myocyte apoptosis, and oxidative stress accompanied with reduction of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1) and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Conversely, administration of the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin and NRF2 inhibitor ML385 greatly abrogated MK-886-mediated cardioprotection after I/R injury. Mechanistically, MK-886 enhanced the expression of the immunoproteasome subunit β5i, which interacted with keap1 and enhanced its degradation, leading to activation of the NRF2-dependent antioxidant response and improvement of mitochondrial fusion-fission balance in the I/R-treated heart. In summary, our present findings indicated that MK-886 could protect the heart against I/R injury and highlight that MK-886 may represent a promising therapeutic candidate for preventing ischaemic disease.","['Immunoproteasome', 'Keap1/NRF2', 'MK-886', 'Mitochondrial dynamics', 'Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury', 'Oxidative stress']",2023-02-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37097268,The impact of the cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase TNFAIP3 gene variation on transcription factor NF-κB activation in acute kidney injury.,"Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation is a deleterious molecular mechanism that drives acute kidney injury (AKI) and manifests in transplanted kidneys as delayed graft function. The TNFAIP3 gene encodes A20, a cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase and a master negative regulator of the NF- κB signaling pathway. Common population-specific TNFAIP3 coding variants that reduce A20's enzyme function and increase NF- κB activation have been linked to heightened protective immunity and autoimmune disease, but have not been investigated in AKI. Here, we functionally identified a series of unique human TNFAIP3 coding variants linked to the autoimmune genome-wide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms of F127C; namely F127C;R22Q, F127C;G281E, F127C;W448C and F127C;N449K that reduce A20's anti-inflammatory function in an NF- κB reporter assay. To investigate the impact of TNFAIP3 hypomorphic coding variants in AKI we tested a mouse Tnfaip3 hypomorph in a model of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). The mouse Tnfaip3 coding variant I325N increases NF- κB activation without overt inflammatory disease, providing an immune boost as I325N mice exhibit enhanced innate immunity to a bacterial challenge. Surprisingly, despite exhibiting increased intra-kidney NF- κB activation with inflammation in IRI, the kidney of I325N mice was protected. The I325N variant influenced the outcome of IRI by changing the dynamic expression of multiple cytoprotective mechanisms, particularly by increasing NF- κB-dependent anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2, BCL-XL, c-FLIP and A20, altering the active redox state of the kidney with a reduction of superoxide levels and the enzyme super oxide dismutase-1, and enhancing cellular protective mechanisms including increased Foxp3+ T cells. Thus, TNFAIP3 gene variants represent a kidney and population-specific molecular factor that can dictate the course of IRI.","['NF-κB', 'TNFAIP3', 'acute kidney injury', 'gene variants', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'kidney transplant']",2021-08-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37097199,Platelet Membrane-Fused Circulating Extracellular Vesicles Protect the Heart from Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) may potentiate cardiac remodeling and heart failure, while effective therapies for I/RI remain lacking. Circulating human plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (hEV) have great potential to protect against I/RI. However, the effective delivery of hEV in vivo remains a limiting factor for clinical application. The present study constructs a biomimetic delivery system of platelet membrane-fused hEV (P-hEV), utilizing the natural affinity of platelets for hEV delivery to the injured vascular and myocardial sites. The results show that platelet membrane and hEV membrane fusion can be achieved through repeated extrusion. Compared to non-modified hEV, P-hEV uptake is greatly enhanced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stressed by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Functionally, P-hEV inhibits HUVEC and neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRCM) apoptosis and promotes HUVECs migration and tube formation under OGD/R stress in vitro. Intravenous delivery of P-hEV more effectively targets and accumulates at injury sites in the heart. Furthermore, P-hEV significantly enhances protection against acute I/RI and attenuates cardiac remodeling at three weeks post-I/RI. In conclusion, the platelet membrane-fused hEV delivery system enhances the target delivery of EV to protect against myocardial I/RI, presenting a novel drug delivery system for ischemic heart diseases.","['biomimetic systems', 'extracellular vesicles', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'platelet membranes', 'target delivery']",2023-01-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Inflammation and apoptosis were critical determinants during MIRI. We conveyed experiments to reveal the regulatory functions of circHECTD1 in MIRI development. The Rat MIRI model was established and determined by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. We analyzed cell apoptosis using TUNEL and flow cytometry. Proteins expression was evaluated by western blot. The RNA level was determined by qRT-PCR. Secreted inflammatory factors were analyzed by ELISA assay. To predict the interaction sequences on circHECTD1, miR-138-5p, and ROCK2, bioinformatics analysis was performed. Dual-luciferase assay was used to confirm these interaction sequences. CircHECTD1 and ROCK2 were upregulated in the rat MIRI model, while miR-138-5p was decreased. CircHECTD1 knockdown alleviated H/R-induced inflammation in H9c2 cells. Direct interaction and regulation of circHECTD1/miR-138-5p and miR-138-5p/ROCK2 were confirmed by dual-luciferase assay. CircHECTD1 promoted H/R-induced inflammation and cell apoptosis by inhibiting miR-138-5p. miR-138-5p alleviated H/R-induced inflammation, while ectopic ROCK2 antagonized such effect of miR-138-5p.

37094696,Ginkgolide C attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory impairments by suppressing CD40/NF-κB pathway.,"Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been applied for thousands of years for the treatment of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases in China. It is written in Compendium of Materia Medica that Ginkgo has the property of ""dispersing poison"", which is now referred to as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Ginkgolides are important active ingredients in Ginkgo biloba leaves and ginkgolide injection has been frequently applied in clinical practice for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, few studies have explored the effect and mechanism of ginkgolide C (GC) with anti-inflammatory activity in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI).The present study aimed to demonstrate whether GC was capable of attenuating CI/RI. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect of GC in CI/RI was explored around the CD40/NF-κB pathway.In vivo, middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established in rats. The neuroprotective effect of GC was assessed by neurological scores, cerebral infarct rate, microvessel ultrastructure, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, brain edema, neutrophil infiltration, and levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and iNOS. In vitro, rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (rBMECs) were preincubated in GC before hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) culture. The cell viability, levels of CD40, ICAM-1, MMP-9, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and activation of NF-κB pathway were examined. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effect of GC was also investigated by silencing CD40 gene in rBMECs.GC attenuated CI/RI as demonstrated by decreasing neurological scores, reducing cerebral infarct rate, improving microvessel ultrastructural features, ameliorating BBB disruption, attenuating brain edema, inhibiting MPO activity, and downregulating levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and iNOS. Coherently, in rBMECs exposed to H/R GC enhanced cell viability and downregulated levels of ICAM-1, MMP-9, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Furthermore, GC suppressed CD40 overexpression and hindered translocation of NF-κB p65 from the cytosol to the nucleus, phosphorylation of IκB-α, and activation of IKK-β in H/R rBMECs. However, GC failed to protect rBMECs from H/R-induced inflammatory impairments and suppress activation of NF-κB pathway when CD40 gene was silenced.GC attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced inflammatory impairments by suppressing CD40/NF-κB pathway, which may provide an available therapeutic drug for CI/RI.","['CD40', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Ginkgolide C', 'Inflammation', 'NF-κB']",2023-02-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37093494,Age-Associated Resilience Against Ischemic Injury in Mice Exposed to Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion.,"Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of death and disability. Although stroke mainly affects aged individuals, animal research is mostly one on young rodents. Here, we examined the development of ischemic injury in young (9-12-week-old) and adult (72-week-old) C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice exposed to 30 min of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Post-ischemic reperfusion did not differ between young and adult mice. Ischemic injury assessed by infarct area and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity assessed by IgG extravasation analysis was smaller in adult compared with young mice. Microvascular viability and neuronal survival assessed by CD31 and NeuN immunohistochemistry were higher in adult than young mice. Tissue protection was associated with stronger activation of cell survival pathways in adult than young mice. Microglial/macrophage accumulation and activation assessed by F4/80 immunohistochemistry were more restricted in adult than young mice, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses were reduced by aging. By means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we identified a hitherto unknown proteome profile comprising the upregulation of glycogen degradation-related pathways and the downregulation of mitochondrial dysfunction-related pathways, which distinguished post-ischemic responses of the aged compared with the young brain. Our study suggests that aging increases the brain's resilience against ischemic injury.","['Aging', 'Ischemia', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Neuronal injury', 'Proteomics', 'Stroke recovery']",2022-10-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Two independent authors selected RCTs, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A meta-analysis was conducted. Eight RCTs involving 682 patients with AIS were included. Compared to patients receiving intravenous rt-PA alone, those receiving intravenous rt-PA combined with SAFI had a higher likelihood of achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months. In addition, the use of SAFI for 2 weeks was associated with better neurological recovery. The evidence of benefit was confirmed by trial sequential analysis (TSA).

37092308,Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes miR-202-5p inhibited pyroptosis to alleviate lung ischemic-reperfusion injury by targeting CMPK2.,"Bone mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (BMSC-exosome) is a potential candidate for lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) treatment. This study aims to investigate the anti-pyroptosis effect of BMSC-exosomes in LIRI. The LIRI cell model was established by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) treatment. Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 levels were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was examined using a LDH assay kit. The interaction between microRNA (miR)-202-5p and cytidine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) was analyzed using dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. BMSC-exosomes promoted cell viability and suppressed pyroptosis in H/R-treated mouse lung epithelial. miR-202-5p was enriched in BMSC-exosomes, and exosomal miR-202-5p inhibition upregulated pyroptosis-associated proteins, including cleaved N-terminal Gasdermin D, nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor family member pyrin domain-containing protein 3, and Caspase1. Meanwhile, miR-202-5p suppressed CMPK2 expression by directly targeting CMPK2. Expectedly, CMPK2 knockdown reversed the promoting effect of exosomal miR-202-5p inhibition on pyroptosis in LIRI. Therefore, BMSC-derived exosome miR-202-5p repressed pyroptosis to inhibit LIRI progression by targeting CMPK2.","['CMPK2', 'LIRI', 'miR-202-5p', 'pyroptosis']",2022-10-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37092126,Electroacupuncture Pretreatment at Zusanli (ST36) Ameliorates Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Mice by Reducing Oxidative Stress via Activating Vagus Nerve-Dependent Nrf2 Pathway.,"Current pharmacological approaches to prevent hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) are limited. To mitigate hepatic injury, more research is needed to improve the understanding of hepatic IRI. Depending on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, acupuncture therapy has been used for the treatment of ischemic diseases with good efficacy. However, the efficacy and mechanism of acupuncture for hepatic IRI are still unclear.Blood provided to the left and middle lobe of mice livers was blocked with a non-invasive clamp and then the clamps were removed for reperfusion to establish a liver IRI model. Quantitative proteomics approach was used to evaluate the impact of EA pretreatment on liver tissue proteome in the IRI group. Serum biochemistry was used to detect liver injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress levels. H&E staining and TUNEL staining were used to detect hepatocyte injury and apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used to detect the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and the level of inflammation. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacities were detected by Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting.We found that EA at Zusanli (ST36) has a protective effect on hepatic IRI in mice by alleviating oxidative stress, hepatocyte death, and inflammation response. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) as a crucial target was regulated by EA and was then successfully validated. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and cervical vagotomy eliminated the protective effect in the EA treatment group.This study firstly demonstrated that EA pretreatment at ST36 significantly ameliorates hepatic IRI in mice by inhibiting oxidative stress via activating the Nrf2 signal pathway, which was vagus nerve-dependent.","['inflammation', 'liver', 'proteomics']",2023-01-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37092117,"LP342, a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor, decreases nitro-oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury in mice.","Some histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms contribute to ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI). Here, we examined whether LP342, the lead candidate of a new generation of hydrazide-based HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), decreases hepatic IRI.IR was induced by clamping blood vessels to ~70% of the livers of mice for 1 h.At 6 h after reperfusion, ALT markedly increased, and wide-spread necrosis, leukocyte infiltration, and apoptosis occurred. LP342 treatment (1 mg/kg, ip) at 20 h or 1 h before ischaemia markedly decreased IRI whereas LP342 treatment upon reperfusion was marginally protective. Nitro-oxidative stress, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to IRI. 4-Hydroxynonenal, 3-nitrotyrosine, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), JNK activation and Sab binding increased markedly after IR, which LP342 blunted. LP342 also induced thioredoxin-1 expression before and after IR. LP342 also decreased mitochondrial depolarisation as detected by intravital microscopy at 2 h after IR. Lastly, LP342 increased acetylation of both histone-3 (class I HDAC substrate) and NFκB p65 but not tubulin (class II HDAC substrate) before and after IR.This novel HDACi protects against IRI most likely by epigenetic upregulation of antioxidant proteins and post-translational modifications of NFκB thus inhibiting iNOS expression and inflammatory responses.","['c-Jun-N-terminal kinase', 'histone deacetylase', 'ischaemia/reperfusion injury', 'liver', 'mitochondrial depolarisation', 'nitro-oxidative stress']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Furthermore, there is scarce information regarding women with AMI in Latin America.To describe the presentation, clinical characteristics, risk factor burden, evidence-based care, and in-hospital outcome in a population of women with AMI admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) in Mexico.Retrospective cohort study including patients with AMI admitted from January 2006 to December 2021 in a CCU. We identified patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). We described demographic characteristics, clinical variables, treatment, and in-hospital outcomes according to gender. Cox regression analysis was used to identify predictors of mortality.Our study included 12,069 patients with AMI, of whom 7,599 had STEMI and 4,470 had NSTEMI. Women represented 19.6% of the population. Women had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and atrial fibrillation than men. For STEMI, women were less likely to receive reperfusion therapy (fibrinolysis; 23.7 vs. 28.5%, p < 0.001 and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); 31.2 vs. 35.1%, p = 0.001) and had more major adverse events than men: heart failure (4.2 vs. 2.5%, p = 0.002), pulmonary edema (3.4% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.001), major bleeding (2.1% vs. 1%, p = 0.002), stroke (1.3% vs. 0.6%, p = 0.008), and mortality (15.1% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001). For NSTEMI, women were less likely to undergo coronary angiography or PCI and had more major bleeding and mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that females had an increase in mortality in STEMI and NSTEMI (HR 1.21, CI 1.01-1.47, p = 0.05 and HR 1.39, CI 1.06-1.81, p = 0.01).Real-world evidence from a hospital in a Latin American low- to middle-income country (LMIC) showed that women with AMI had more comorbidities, received less reperfusion treatment or invasive strategies, and had worse outcomes.

37091920,Electroacupuncture treatment ameliorates depressive-like behavior and cognitive dysfunction via CB1R dependent mitochondria biogenesis after experimental global cerebral ischemic stroke.,"This study aimed to identify the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment on post-stroke depression (PSD) and explore whether cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R)-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis accounts for the treatment effect of EA.The PSD mouse model was induced by a consecutive 14-day chronic unpredictable stress operation after 7 days of recovery from the bilateral common carotid artery occlusion surgery. Either EA treatment or sham stimulation was performed for 14 consecutive days from Day 7 after the BCCAO operation. Subjects' PSD-like behaviors were tested via open field test, sucrose preference test, novelty suppressed feeding test, tail suspension test, and forced swim test, and subjects' cognitive function was examined using Y-maze and novelty object recognition test. In addition, the levels of CB1R, mitochondrial biogenesis-related proteins (nuclear transcription factor 1, NRF1; mitochondrial transcription factor A, TFAM), proteins related to mitochondrial function (Cytochrome C, Cyto C; AIF, COX IV), and mitochondrial DNA were measured. To elucidate the role of CB1R in EA treatment, CB1R antagonists AM251 and CB1R-shRNA were given to mice before EA treatment. Likewise, subjects' depressive-like behaviors, cognitive function, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial biogenesis were examined after the PSD procedure.It has been showed that EA successfully ameliorated depressive-like behaviors, improved cognitive dysfunctions, and upregulated CB1R, NRF1 and TFAM expressions. However, the supplementation of AM251 and CB1R-shRNA blocked the antidepressant-like effects generated by EA, and EA failed to improve cognitive dysfunction, upregulate CB1R protein expression, and increase mitochondrial function and biogenesis.Altogether, these results indicated that EA ameliorated PSD-like behaviors in mice, improved cognitive dysfunctions after PSD, and promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by activating CB1R, a novel mechanism underlying EA's antidepressant-like effects in treating PSD.","['cannabinoid receptor 1', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'cognitive dysfunction', 'depressive-like behaviors', 'electroacupuncture', 'mitochondrial biogenesis', 'mitochondrial function']",2022-12-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37091267,Protective role of remote ischemic conditioning in renal transplantation and partial nephrectomy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Studies have shown that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) can effectively attenuate ischemic-reperfusion injury in the heart and brain, but the effect on ischemic-reperfusion injury in patients with kidney transplantation or partial nephrectomy remains controversial. The main objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate whether RIC provides renal protection after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing kidney transplantation or partial nephrectomy.A computer-based search was conducted to retrieve relevant publications from the PubMed database, Embase database, Cochrane Library and Web of Science database. We then conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that met our study inclusion criteria.Eleven eligible studies included a total of 1,145 patients with kidney transplantation or partial nephrectomy for systematic review and meta-analysis, among whom 576 patients were randomly assigned to the RIC group and the remaining 569 to the control group. The 3-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was improved in the RIC group, which was statistically significant between the two groups on kidney transplantation [P < 0.001; mean difference (MD) = 2.74, confidence interval (CI): 1.41 to 4.06; I 2 = 14%], and the 1- and 2-day postoperative Scr levels in the RIC group decreased, which was statistically significant between the two groups on kidney transplantation (1-day postoperative: P < 0.001; MD = 0.10, CI: 0.05 to 0.15, I 2 = 0; 2-day postoperative: P = 0.006; MD = 0.41, CI: 0.12 to 0.70, I 2 = 0), but at other times, there was no significant difference between the two groups in Scr levels. The incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) decreased, but there was no significant difference (P = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.26). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of cross-clamp time, cold ischemia time, warm ischemic time, acute rejection (AR), graft loss or length of hospital stay.Our meta-analysis showed that the effect of remote ischemia conditioning on reducing serum creatinine (Scr) and improving estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) seemed to be very weak, and we did not observe a significant protective effect of RIC on renal ischemic-reperfusion. Due to small sample sizes, more studies using stricter inclusion criteria are needed to elucidate the nephroprotective effect of RIC in renal surgery in the future.","['ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'kidney transplantation', 'meta-analysis', 'nephrectomy', 'nephroprotection', 'remote ischemic conditioning']",2022-08-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37091265,CD137 signaling aggravates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting mitophagy mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,"The inflammatory response caused by the NLRP3 is closely related to the formation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Costimulatory receptor CD137 and its ligand play a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory immune response in atherosclerosis, which is the fundamental cause of cardiovascular diseases. However, the roles of CD137 signaling in the process of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury remain unknown.Genetic ablation was used to determine the functional significance of CD137 in myocardial IR injury. Expression of CD137 was examined by Western-blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry in a murine IR model by coronary artery ligation. Even's blue-TTC staining and echocardiography to evaluate the severity of myocardial IR injury. Furthermore, HL-1 cardiomyocytes treated with agonist-CD137 recombinant protein were used to explore the underlying mechanism in CD137 signaling-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation or LPS/ATP.We demonstrated that CD137 knockout significantly improved cardiac function, accompanied by a markedly reduced NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response and IA/AAR which were reversed by mitophagy inhibitor Mdivi-1. Activating CD137 signaling significantly inhibited mitophagy and provoked NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response in H/R-injured or LPS-primed and ATP-stimulated HL-1 cardiomyocytes, the effects of which could be abolished by either anti-CD137 or mitophagy activator FCCP. Besides, mitochondrial ROS was augmented by activating CD137 signaling through the suppression of mitophagy.Our results reveal that activating CD137 signaling aggravates myocardial IR injury by upregulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation via suppressing mitophagy and promoting mtROS generation.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37090078,Calpain inhibitor MDL28170 alleviates cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury by suppressing inflammation and autophagy in a rat model of cardiac arrest.,"Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is associated with a poor neurological prognosis in patients who have experienced cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of a calpain inhibitor in CIRI using a rat model of CA. CA was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, and MDL28170 (a calpain inhibitor) was administered to the rats within 30 min after the return of spontaneous circulation. Differences between groups were evaluated by measuring survival rate, CPR duration and neurological deficit score. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining were performed to assess cerebral injury, and microstructure and autophagy were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of calpain-1, calpain-2, calpastatin, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, P62, beclin-1 and LC3 in the brain tissues were determined using western blotting and double immunofluorescence staining. There was no significant difference in CPR duration or survival rate among the groups. At 24 h after CPR, the CA group demonstrated damaged tissue morphology; decreased neurological deficit scores, and P62 expression; and upregulated calpain-2, IL-1βp17, TNF-α, beclin-1 and LC3 levels in the cortex. However, MDL28170 improved neuronal function and suppressed inflammation and autophagy by inhibiting calpain-2 level, but there were no differences in the calpain-1 and calpastatin levels. These results suggest that calpain-2, inflammation and autophagy are involved in CA-induced CIRI. MDL28170 inhibited calpain-2 expression, inflammation and autophagy, which suggests its potential efficacy in treating post-CA nerve damage.","['MDL28170', 'autophagy', 'calpain-2', 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'inflammation']",2022-07-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37088562,Improved methodology for efficient establishment of the myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model in pigs through the median thoracic incision.,"To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of establishing porcine ischemia-reperfusion models by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, we first randomly divided 16 male Bama pigs into a sham group and a model group. After anesthesia, we separated the arteries and veins. Subsequently, we rapidly located the LAD coronary artery at the beginning of its first diagonal branch through a mid-chest incision. Then, we loosened and released the ligation line after five minutes of pre-occlusion. Finally, we ligated the LAD coronary artery in situ two minutes later and loosened the ligature 60 min after ischemia. Compared with the sham group, electrocardiogram showed multiple continuous lead ST-segment elevations, and ultrasound cardiogram showed significantly lower ejection fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening at one hour and seven days post-operation in the model group. Twenty-four hours after the operation, cardiac troponin T and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme levels significantly increased in the model group, compared with the sham group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed the presence of many inflammatory cells infiltrating the interstitium of the myocardium in the model group but not in the sham group. Masson staining revealed a significant increase in infarct size in the ischemia/reperfusion group. All eight pigs in the model group recovered with normal sinus heart rates, and the survival rate was 100%. In conclusion, the method can provide an accurate and stable large animal model for preclinical research on ischemia/reperfusion with a high success rate and homogeneity of the myocardial infarction area.","['Bama pig', 'animal model', 'coronary artery ligation', 'myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37088161,Transferrin-targeted iridium nanoagglomerates with multi-enzyme activities for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury therapy.,"Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a complex pathological condition with high mortality. In particular, reperfusion can stimulate overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of inflammation, causing severe secondary injuries to the brain. Despite tremendous efforts, it remains urgent to rationally design antioxidative agents with straightforward and efficient ROS scavenging capability. Herein, a potent antioxidative agent was explored based on iridium oxide nano-agglomerates (Tf-IrO2 NAs) via the facile transferrin (Tf)-templated biomineralization approach, and innovatively applied to treat CIRI. Containing some small-size IrO2 aggregates, these NAs possess intrinsic hydroxyl radicals (•OH)-scavenging ability and multifarious enzyme activities, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Moreover, they also showed improved blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and enhanced accumulation in the ischemic brain via Tf receptor-mediated transcytosis. Therefore, Tf-IrO2 NAs achieved robust in vitro anti-inflammatory and cytoprotection effects against oxidative stress. Importantly, mice were effectively protected against CIRI by enhanced ROS scavenging activity in vivo, and the therapeutic mechanism was systematically verified. These findings broaden the idea of expanding Ir-based NAs as potent antioxidative agents to treat CIRI and other ROS-mediated diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: (1) The ROS-scavenging activities of IrO2 are demonstrated comprehensively, which enriched the family of nano-antioxidants. (2) The engineering Tf-IrO2 nano-agglomerates present unique multifarious enzyme activities and simultaneous transferrin targeting and BBB crossing ability for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury therapy. (3) This work may open an avenue to enable the use of IrO2 to alleviate ROS-mediated inflammatory and brain injury diseases.","['Blood-brain barrier', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Iridium agglomerates', 'Multi-enzyme activities', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2022-10-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37087770,RNA binding protein RPS3 mediates microglial polarization by activating NLRP3 inflammasome via SIRT1 in ischemic stroke.,"Ischemic stroke is the obstruction of cerebral blood flow with a high morbidity. Microglial polarization is a contributing factor for ischemic stroke-induced injury. Here, we focused on function and mechanism of RNA binding protein RPS3 in microglial polarization after ischemic stroke.Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was conducted in SD rats. Infarct area was detected by TTC staining and neurological score was assessed. Fluorescence staining tested neuronal apoptosis and microglial differentiation. Oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) was applied for treating microglia. Levels of RPS3, SIRT1, M1 and M2 polarization markers (CD86, iNOS, CD206, Arg-1) were determined by RT-qPCR. Western blot detected RPS3, SIRT1, NLRP3, ASC and Cleaved-caspase-1 expression. RIP assay validated that RPS3 interacted with SIRT1. CCK-8 measured cell viability. Flow cytometry and ELISA assessed M1 and M2 polarization markers. LDH release was detected using colorimetric CytoTox 96 Cytotoxicity kit.RPS3 depletion improved neurological dysfunction and reduced infarction area in rats after tMCAO. Knockdown of RPS3 resulted in increased SIRT1 expression and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and induced microglia M2 polarization after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Besides, RPS3 directly targeted SIRT1 and reduced its expression in microglia. RPS3 silencing suppressed OGD/R-triggered neuronal and microglial cell death through SIRT1. Moreover, RPS3 activated NLRP3 inflammasome and regulated microglial polarization via SIRT1.RPS3 regulates microglial polarization and neuronal injury through SIRT1/NLRP3 pathway, suggesting a novel target for ischemic stroke treatment.","['Ischemic stroke', 'Microglial polarization', 'NLRP3 inflammasome', 'RPS3', 'SIRT1']",2023-03-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

A total of 48 adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the sham-operated group (group Sham), the model group (group Model), the EA group (group EA), and the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) group (group JNK), with 12 rats in each group. Biospecimens were collected randomly from six rats in each group four hours after reperfusion. Evans Blue and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride double-staining were applied to observe each group's myocardial damage area and risk area. We collected 4 ml of blood by abdominal aortic method to detect serum troponin cTnI level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the remaining six in each group, a part of myocardial tissue below the ligation line was stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining; the other amount of myocardial tissue was detected by Western blotting to determine the expression levels of Bcl-2, Beclin1, and the phosphorylation levels of Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 in Bcl-2. In results: electroacupuncture (EA) intervention during reperfusion significantly reduced the myocardial infarction area, cTnI level, and myocardial apoptosis, upregulated Bcl-2 expression, downregulated Beclin 1 expression and inhibited phosphorylation levels of Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 in Bcl-2. We concluded that EA effectively inhibited apoptosis by upregulating Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 in Bcl-2. This reduced the separation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1, restrains excessive autophagy, alleviates MIRI, and has a protective effect on myocardial tissue.",[],2022-11-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Hypertonic sodium lactate (HSL) may be beneficial after CA by buffering severe metabolic acidosis, increasing brain perfusion and cardiac performance, reducing cerebral swelling, and serving as an alternative energetic cellular substrate. The aim of this study was to test the effects of HSL infusion on brain and cardiac injury in an experimental model of CA.After a 10-min electrically induced CA followed by 5 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers, adult swine (n = 35) were randomly assigned to receive either balanced crystalloid (controls, n = 11) or HSL infusion started during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR, Intra-arrest, n = 12) or after return of spontaneous circulation (Post-ROSC, n = 11) for the subsequent 12 h. In all animals, extensive multimodal neurological and cardiovascular monitoring was implemented. All animals were treated with targeted temperature management at 34 °C.Thirty-four of the 35 (97.1%) animals achieved ROSC; one animal in the Intra-arrest group died before completing the observation period. Arterial pH, lactate and sodium concentrations, and plasma osmolarity were higher in HSL-treated animals than in controls (p < 0.001), whereas potassium concentrations were lower (p = 0.004). Intra-arrest and Post-ROSC HSL infusion improved hemodynamic status compared to controls, as shown by reduced vasopressor requirements to maintain a mean arterial pressure target > 65 mmHg (p = 0.005 for interaction; p = 0.01 for groups). Moreover, plasma troponin I and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) concentrations were lower in HSL-treated groups at several time-points than in controls.In this experimental CA model, HSL infusion was associated with reduced vasopressor requirements and decreased plasma concentrations of measured biomarkers of cardiac and cerebral injury.","['Anoxic injury, ischemia–reperfusion', 'Cardiac arrest', 'Post-arrest', 'Resuscitation']",2023-03-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37086952,Tanshinone IIA enhances the therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via up-regulating miR-223-5p.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) is a serious obstacle for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) to benefit from post-ischemic reflow. The low immunogenicity and low carcinogenicity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes (exo) offer advantage in treating myocardial injuries. Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is an effective drug for MI/RI treatment. However, the underlying mechanism and targets remain obscure. In this study, we systematically investigated the therapeutic effect and its mechanism of TSA-pretreated MSC-derived exosomes (TSA-MSCexo) in ameliorating MI/RI in rats. Expectedly, the MI/RI was significantly relieved by TSA-MSCexo compared with MSCexo. Moreover, the overexpression of CCR2 in rats' heart was used to determine CCR2 had a regulatory effect on monocyte infiltration and angiogenesis after MI/RI. MiRNA microarray analysis of MSCexo and TSA-MSCexo revealed miR-223-5p an effective candidate mediator for TSA-MSCexo to exert its cardioprotective function and CCR2 as the downstream target. In summary, our findings indicated that miR-223-5p packaged in TSA-MSCexo inhibited CCR2 activation to reduce monocyte infiltration and enhanced angiogenesis to alleviate MI/RI. Thus, the development of cell free therapies for exosomes derived from the combination TSA and MSC provides an effective strategy for the clinical therapies of ischemic cardiomyopathy.","['Exosomes', 'Mesenchymal stem cell', 'Myocardial ischemia reperfusion', 'Tanshinone IIA', 'miR-223-5p']",2022-12-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Ischemia-free organ transplantation is a novel approach designed to avoid IRI, with the potential to improve outcomes.In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, recipients of livers from donors after brain death were randomly assigned to receive either an ischemia-free or a 'conventional' transplant. Primary end point was the incidence of early allograft dysfunction. Secondary end points included complications related to graft IRI.65 out of 68 randomized patients underwent transplants and were included in the analysis. 32 patients received ischemia-free liver transplantation (IFLT), and 33 received conventional liver transplantation (CLT). Early allograft dysfunction occurred in 2 (6%) randomized to IFLT and in 8 (24%) randomized to CLT (difference, -18%; 95% CI, -35% to -1%; P=.044). Post-reperfusion syndrome occurred in 3 (9%) randomized to IFLT and in 21 (64%) randomized to CLT (difference, -54%; 95% CI, -74% to -35%; P < .001). Non-anastomotic biliary strictures diagnosed with protocol magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography at 12 months were observed in 2 recipients (8%) randomized to IFLT and in 9 recipients (36%) randomized to CLT (difference, -28%; 95% CI, -50% to -7%; P = .014). The comprehensive complication index at one year after transplantation was 30.48 (95% CI, 23.25-37.71) in the IFLT group vs 42.14 (95% CI, 35.01-49.26) in the CLT group (difference, -11.66; 95% CI, -21.81 to -1.51; P = .025).Among patients with end-stage liver disease, IFLT, compared with conventional approach, significantly reduced complications related to ischemia reperfusion injury.Chictr.org.

37085803,The mechanism by which miR-494-3p regulates PGC1-α-mediated inhibition of mitophagy in cardiomyocytes and alleviation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"The purpose of this study was to explore whether miR-494-3p inhibits the occurrence of mitochondrial autophagy in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting the expression of PGC1-α and to supplement the theoretical basis for the role of autophagy in cardiac injury induced by hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R).The expression of miR-494-3p was detected by RT‒qPCR, and the expression of PGC1-α, autophagy-related proteins (LC3, Beclin 1), apoptosis-related proteins (Bax and Bcl-2), PINK1/Parkin signaling pathway-related proteins (PINK1, Parkin) and mitochondrial change-related proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1) was detected by Western blotting. The changes in mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by JC-1 staining (ΔΨm). The formation of autophagosomes was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Cell proliferation activity was detected by CCK-8, and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. A dual-luciferase gene reporter assay identified a targeted binding site between miR-494-3p and PGC1-α.The results showed that miR-494-3p and PGC1-α were differentially expressed in H/R cardiomyocytes; that is, the expression of miR-494-3p was downregulated, and the expression of PGC1-α was upregulated. In addition, mitochondrial autophagy occurred in H/R cardiomyocytes. That is, LC3-II/LC3-I, Beclin 1, PINK1, and Parkin expression was upregulated, Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 expression was downregulated, and the mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased. The transfection of miR-494-3p mimic can significantly improve the cell proliferation activity of cardiomyocytes and inhibit the occurrence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy, while the transfection of miR-494-3p inhibitor has the opposite result. After transfection of the miR-494-3p mimic, treatment with autophagy inhibitors and activators changed the effects of miR-494-3p on cardiomyocyte proliferation and apoptosis. At the same time, the overexpression of PGC1-α reversed the promoting effect of miR-494-3p on cardiomyocyte proliferation and the inhibitory effect on apoptosis and autophagy.MiR-494-3p can target and negatively regulate the expression of PGC1-α to inhibit mitophagy in cardiomyocytes.","['Cardiomyocyte', 'Mitophagy', 'Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'PGC1-α', 'miR-494-3p']",2022-10-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37084816,Hydrogen sulfide inhibits lipopolysaccharide-based neuroinflammation-induced astrocyte polarization after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"The effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-based neuroinflammation following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) on the genotypic transformation of reactive astrocytes and its relationship with endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were investigated in present study. We found that LPS promoted the cerebral I/R-induced A1 astrocytes proliferation in mouse hippocampal tissues and deteriorated the reduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) content in mouse sera, H2S donor NaHS could inhibit A1 astrocytes proliferation. Similarly, knockout of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), one of endogenous H2S synthases, likewise up-regulated the cerebral I/R-induced A1 astrocytes proliferation, which could also be blocked by NaHS. Besides, supplement with H2S promoted the A2 astrocytes proliferation in hippocampal tissues of CSE knockout (CSE KO) mice or LPS-treated mice following cerebral I/R. In the oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of astrocytes, H2S also promoted the transformation of astrocytes into A2 subtype. Moreover, we found that H2S could up-regulate the expression of α-subunit of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels in astrocytes, and the channel opener BMS-191011 likewise promoted the transformation of astrocyte into A2 subtype. In conclusion, H2S inhibits the proliferation of A1 astrocytes induced by LPS-based neuroinflammation following cerebral I/R and promotes the transformation of astrocytes into A2 subtype, which may be related to up-regulation of BKCa channels.","['Astrocyte', 'BK(Ca) channel', 'H(2)S', 'Phenotype']",2023-01-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37083129,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the transcriptomic landscape of kidneys in patients with ischemic acute kidney injury.,"Ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common syndrome associated with considerable mortality and healthcare costs. Up to now, the underlying pathogenesis of ischemic AKI remains incompletely understood, and specific strategies for early diagnosis and treatment of ischemic AKI are still lacking. Here, this study aimed to define the transcriptomic landscape of AKI patients through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis in kidneys.In this study, scRNA-seq technology was applied to kidneys from two ischemic AKI patients, and three human public scRNA-seq datasets were collected as controls. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cell clusters of kidneys were determined. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, as well as the ligand-receptor interaction between cells, were performed. We also validated several DEGs expression in kidneys from human ischemic AKI and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury induced AKI mice through immunohistochemistry staining.15 distinct cell clusters were determined in kidney from subjects of ischemic AKI and control. The injured proximal tubules (PT) displayed a proapoptotic and proinflammatory phenotype. PT cells of ischemic AKI had up-regulation of novel pro-apoptotic genes including USP47 , RASSF4 , EBAG9 , IER3 , SASH1 , SEPTIN7 , and NUB1 , which have not been reported in ischemic AKI previously. Several hub genes were validated in kidneys from human AKI and renal I/R injury mice, respectively. Furthermore, PT highly expressed DEGs enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling. DEGs overexpressed in other tubular cells were primarily enriched in nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling, estrogen signaling, interleukin (IL)-12 signaling, and IL-17 signaling. Overexpressed genes in kidney-resident immune cells including macrophages, natural killer T (NKT) cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells were associated with leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, cell adhesion, and complement activation. In addition, the ligand-receptor interactions analysis revealed prominent communications between macrophages and monocytes with other cells in the process of ischemic AKI.Together, this study reveals distinct cell-specific transcriptomic atlas of kidney in ischemic AKI patients, altered signaling pathways, and potential cell-cell crosstalk in the development of AKI. These data reveal new insights into the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies in ischemic AKI.",[],2022-07-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37082995,The roles of AMPK/mTOR autophagy pathway in the acute kidney injury-induced acute lung injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most challenging clinical problems in kidney disease due to serious complications and high mortality rate, which can lead to acute lung injury (ALI) through inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been reported to be involved in the development of renal ischemia-reperfusion through autophagy and it remains unclear whether AMPK/mTOR pathway has an effect on the AKI-induced ALI. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of autophagy-related AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway on inflammatory factors and oxidative stress in an AKI-induced ALI model. The 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups randomly: (i) sham, (ii) ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), (iii) IRI + rapamycin (RA), and (iv) IRI + 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Unilateral flank incisions were made and right kidneys were excised. The left kidney was subjected to 60 min of ischemia followed by 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion. The levels of Scr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Wet/Dry ratio, indexes of inflammation, and oxidative stress were assayed. Histological examinations were performed. The protein expression of AMPK, mTOR, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, and Beclin-1, ULK1 was evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Compared to the rats from the sham group, IRI rats showed significantly pulmonary damage after AKI with increased Scr, BUN, Wet/Dry ratio, indexes of inflammation, and oxidative stress. The expression of AMPK, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, Beclin-1, and ULK1 and were increased, while p62 and mTOR were decreased. In addition, RA treatment significantly attenuated lung injury by promoting autophagy through the activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and 3-MA treatment exhibited adverse effects inversely. Therefore, the activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway after renal IRI induction could significantly attenuate kidney injury and following AKI-induced ALI by inducing autophagy, which alienates inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.","['AMPK/mTOR pathway', 'Acute lung injury', 'autophagy', 'inflammation', 'renal ischemic-reperfusion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37082623,Responses of hepatic sinusoidal cells to liver ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"The liver displays a remarkable regenerative capacity in response to acute liver injury. In addition to the proliferation of hepatocytes during liver regeneration, non-parenchymal cells, including liver macrophages, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play critical roles in liver repair and regeneration. Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of increased liver damage during liver resection, transplantation, and trauma. Impaired liver repair increases postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent liver surgery. Successful liver repair and regeneration after liver IRI requires coordinated interplay and synergic actions between hepatic resident cells and recruited cell components. However, the underlying mechanisms of liver repair after liver IRI are not well understood. Recent technological advances have revealed the heterogeneity of each liver cell component in the steady state and diseased livers. In this review, we describe the progress in the biology of liver non-parenchymal cells obtained from novel technological advances. We address the functional role of each cell component in response to liver IRI and the interactions between diverse immune repertoires and non-hematopoietic cell populations during the course of liver repair after liver IRI. We also discuss how these findings can help in the design of novel therapeutic approaches. Growing insights into the cellular interactions during liver IRI would enhance the pathology of liver IRI understanding comprehensively and further develop the strategies for improvement of liver repair.","['endothelial cells', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'liver repair', 'macrophage', 'stellate cell']",2023-02-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37081569,Remifentanil but not sufentanil induces cardioprotection in human ischemic heart muscle in vitro.,"Previous studies on animal models have suggested that δ-opioid receptor (OR) signaling is the primary pathway responsible for opioids' cardioprotective effect. We hypothesize that the μ-OR's activation protects the human heart muscle.We performed the experiments on muscular trabeculae obtained from the right atrial appendages of 104 consecutive patients subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery. Two trabeculae from each patient were studied simultaneously and exposed to 60 min of hypoxia with subsequent 60 min of reoxygenation. Remifentanil (5 μM or 50 μM) or sufentanil (40 μM or 400 μM) was used from the time of reoxygenation. Trabeculae contractility was assessed as the maximal amplitude of the contraction at baseline, after 60 min of hypoxia, during reoxygenation, and after norepinephrine application.During reperfusion, the application of remifentanil improved cardiomyocytes' function as compared to the control group (time from reperfusion: 15 min: 39.8% vs. 21.7%, p = 0.01; 30 min: 41.4% vs. 21.8%, p = 0.01; 60 min: 42.7% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.04; after norepinephrine: 64.7% vs. 43.2%, p = 0.03). The application of sufentanil did not influence cardiomyocyte function as can be seen when comparing the results of the experimental and control group.Remifentanil, but not sufentanil, induces a cardioprotective effect on human right atria muscle in in vitro conditions, manifested as the increased amplitude of their contraction during reperfusion after 60 min of ischemia.","['Cardioprotection', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injury; remifentanil', 'Sufentanil']",2022-05-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37081375,PCSK9 Inhibition Regulates Infarction-Induced Cardiac Myofibroblast Transdifferentiation via Notch1 Signaling.,"Increasing evidence suggests that PCSK9 inhibition protects cardiomyocytes against ischemia-reperfusion injury after myocardial infarction. However, it is not clear whether PCSK9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) affects cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) activation after MI. In this study we used SBC-115076, an antagonist of PCSK9, to investigate the role of PCSK9i in the conversion of CFs to cardiac myofibroblasts (CMFs) after MI and provided a basic for its clinical application in cardiac fibrosis after MI. In vivo study, PCSK9i was injected into mice 4 days after MI. Cardiac function and degree of fibrosis were evaluated by echocardiographic and tissue staining after treatment. Western blot showed that PCSK9i treatment decreases expression of α-SMA, collagen and increases expression of Notch1 in border infarct area. Vitro studies showed that PCSK9i decreased the degree of fibrosis, migration, and collagen fiber deposition in CFs. Confocal microscopy imaging also showed that hypoxia contributes to the formation of α-SMA stress filaments, and PCSK9i alleviated this state. Moreover, overexpression of Notch1 further suppress the activation of CFs under hypoxia. These results revealed that SBC-115076 ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction through inhibition of the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts via Notch1/Hes1 signaling.","['Cardiac fibroblasts', 'Cardiac fibrosis', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Notch1 signaling']",2023-01-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37080449,Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells-derived Exosomal Long Non-coding RNA KLF3 antisense RNA 1 Enhances Autophagy to Protect Against Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Via ETS Variant Transcription Factor 4/Silent Information Regulator 1 Axis.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes are demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in stroke. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) KLF3 antisense RNA 1 (KLF3-AS1) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exos) in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of BMSCs. A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo and a BV-2 cell model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/RX) in vitro were established. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected using MTT assay, TUNEL staining and flow cytometry, respectively. Related proteins were determined with western blot and immunohistochemistry, while related RNAs were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Neurological deficit and cerebral infarct volume were evaluated by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and TTC staining, respectively. Our observations indicate that exosomes derived from BMSCs-preconditioned medium exerted neuroprotective effects, as indicated by the increased cell viability and the suppressed apoptosis in OGD/RX-suffered BV-2 cells. KLF3-AS1 expression was upregulated in BMSCs-Exos. Furthermore, KLF3-AS1 knockdown antagonized the protective effects of BMSCs-Exos. Mechanistically, BMSCs-Exos carrying KLF3-AS1 inhibited apoptosis via enhancing autophagy. KLF3-AS1 was found to recruit ETS variant transcription factor 4 (ETV4), which upregulated Sirt1 expression. Knockdown of KLF3-AS1 neutralized the protective effects of BMSCs-Exos on MCAO-induced brain injury, which was then reversed by the treatment with Sirt1 inhibitor EX527. We concluded that KLF3-AS1 derived from BMSCs-Exos promoted autophagy to alleviate I/R injury via ETV4/Sirt1 axis.","['ETV4', 'Sirt1', 'bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'exosomes', 'lncRNA KLF3-AS1']",2022-06-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37080367,Network pharmacology-based prediction and validation of the active ingredients and potential mechanisms of the Huangxiong formula for treating ischemic stroke.,"Huangxiong Formula (HXF) is composed of four herbs: Rheum palmatum L., Ligusticum striatum DC., Curcuma aromatica Salisb., and Acorus gramineus Aiton. HXF is clinically used for the treatment of ischemic stroke (IS). However, its molecular mechanism remains unclear.A network pharmacology-based strategy combined with experimental study in vivo and in vitro to were used to investigate the bioactive components, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of HXF in the treatment of IS.The components of HXF were detected by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). The potential active ingredients of HXF were acquired from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and literature, and corresponding targets were discerned through the Swiss TargetPrediction database. IS-related targets were obtained from Genecards, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), and DisGeNET. The intersection of ingredient and disease targets was screened, and a herbal-compound-target network was constructed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was created, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed. Based on these analyses, we established a compound-target-pathway (C-T-P) network. A cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) animal model was established, and the cerebral protective effect of HXF was assessed. The accuracy of the predicted targets was verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Hippocampal neuronal injury cell model induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) was used to evaluate the protective effect of α-Asarone. Furthermore, molecular docking, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were performed to verify whether α-Asarone can bind to PI3K.A total of 44 active ingredients and 795 gene targets were identified through network pharmacology. Network analysis showed that naringenin, eupatin, kaempferol, and α-Asarone were possible drug candidates. SRC, AKT1, TP53, MAPK3, STAT3, HRAS, CTNNB1, EGFR, VEGFA, PIK3R1 could serve as potential drug targets. KEGG analysis implied that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway might play an important role in treating IS by HXF. Moreover, HXF significantly reduced neurological impairment, cerebral infarct volume, brain index, and brain histopathological damage in I/R rats. The mRNA expression of the top 10 potential targets was verified in the brain tissue. The C-T-P network and UPLC analysis suggested that α-Asarone might be an important component of HXF and can inhibit oxidative stress and apoptosis in HT22 cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Molecular docking, DARTS, and CETSA assay analysis confirmed that there were direct interactions between α-Asarone and PI3K.HXF had a therapeutic effect in IS with multi-component, multi-target, and multi-approach features. α-Asarone, identified as one of the major active components of HXF, could alleviate oxidative stress and apoptosis by targeting PI3K/AKT pathway.","['Huangxiong formula', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Network pharmacology', 'PI3K/AKT signal Pathway', 'α-Asarone']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37078818,Fasudil alleviates cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury by inhibiting inflammation and improving neurotrophic factor expression in rats.,"The Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil exerts neuroprotective effects. We previously showed that fasudil can regulate M1/M2 microglia polarization and inhibit neuroinflammation. Here, the therapeutic effect of fasudil on cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R) injury was investigated using the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in Sprague‑Dawley rats. The effect of fasudil on the phenotype of microglia and neurotrophic factors in the I/R brain and its potential molecular mechanism was also explored. It was found that fasudil ameliorated neurological deficits, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammatory response in rats with cerebral I/R injury. Fasudil also promoted the polarization of microglia into the M2 phenotype, in turn promoting the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, fasudil significantly inhibited the expression of TLR4 and NF‑κB. These findings suggest that fasudil could inhibit the neuroinflammatory response and reduce brain injury after I/R injury by regulating the shift of microglia from an inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti‑inflammatory M2 phenotype, which may be related to the regulation of the TLR4/ NF‑κB signal pathway.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37078795,Metal Coordination Complexes as Therapeutic Agents for Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which describes the cell damage and death that occurs after blood and oxygen are restored to ischemic or hypoxic tissue, is a significant factor within the mortality rates of heart disease and stroke patients. At the cellular level, the return of oxygen triggers an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) overload, which both contribute to cell death. Despite the widespread occurrence of IRI in different pathological conditions, there are currently no clinically approved therapeutic agents for its management. In this Perspective, we will briefly discuss the current therapeutic options for IRI and then describe in great detail the potential role and arising applications of metal-containing coordination and organometallic complexes for treating this condition. This Perspective categorizes these metal compounds based on their mechanisms of action, which include their use as delivery agents for gasotransmitters, inhibitors of mCa2+ uptake, and catalysts for the decomposition of ROS.

37078794,Ligustrazine Nanoparticle Hitchhiking on Neutrophils for Enhanced Therapy of Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Ischemic stroke is a refractory disease that endangers human health and safety owing to cerebral ischemia. Brain ischemia induces a series of inflammatory reactions. Neutrophils migrate from the circulatory system to the site of cerebral ischemia and accumulate in large numbers at the site of inflammation across the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, hitchhiking on neutrophils to deliver drugs to ischemic brain sites could be an optimal strategy. Since the surface of neutrophils has a formyl peptide receptor (FPR), this work modifies a nanoplatform surface by the peptide cinnamyl-F-(D)L-F-(D)L-F (CFLFLF), which can specifically bind to the FPR receptor. After intravenous injection, the fabricated nanoparticles effectively adhered to the surface of neutrophils in peripheral blood mediated by FPR, thereby hitchhiking with neutrophils to achieve higher accumulation at the inflammatory site of cerebral ischemia. In addition, the nanoparticle shell is composed of a polymer with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive bond breaking and is encased in ligustrazine, a natural product with neuroprotective properties. In conclusion, the strategy of hitching the delivered drugs to neutrophils in this study could improve drug enrichment in the brain, thereby providing a general delivery platform for ischemic stroke or other inflammation-related diseases.","['cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'drug delivery', 'ligustrazine', 'neutrophils', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2023-02-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37078299,Rac1 inhibition protects the kidney against kidney ischemia/reperfusion through the inhibition of macrophage migration.,"Kidney ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), is associated with the migration of inflammatory cells into the kidney. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), a member of the Rho family of small GTPase, plays an important role in inflammatory cell migration by cytoskeleton rearrangement. Here, we investigated the role of Rac1 on kidney I/R injury and macrophage migration. Male mice were subjected to either 25 min of bilateral ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R) or a sham operation. Some mice were administrated with either NSC23766, an inhibitor of Rac1, or 0.9% NaCl (vehicle). Kidney damage and Rac1 activity and expression were measured. The migration and lamellipodia formation of RAW264.7 cells, mouse monocyte/macrophage, induced by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, a chemokine) were determined using transwell migration assay and phalloidin staining, respectively. In sham-operated kidneys, Rac1 was expressed in tubular cells and interstitial cells. In I/R-injured kidneys, Rac1 expression was decreased in tubule cells in correlation with the damage of tubular cells, whereas Rac1 expression increased in the interstitium in correlation with an increased population of F4/80 cells, monocytes/macrophages. I/R increased Rac1 activity without changing total Rac1 expression in the whole kidney lysates. NSC23766 administration blocked Rac1 activation and protected the kidney against I/R-induced kidney damage and interstitial F4/80 cell increase. NSC23766 suppressed monocyte MCP-1-induced lamellipodia and filopodia formation and migration of RAW 264.7 cells. These results indicate Rac1 inhibition protects the kidney against I/R via inhibition of monocytes/macrophages migration into the kidney.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Ischemia', 'Macrophage migration', 'Macrophages', 'Rac1-GTPase']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37076541,In vivo imaging of renal microvasculature in a murine ischemia-reperfusion injury model using optical coherence tomography angiography.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides three-dimensional structural and semiquantitative imaging of microvasculature in vivo. We developed an OCTA imaging protocol for a murine kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model to investigate the correlation between renal microvascular changes and ischemic damage. Mice were divided into mild and moderate IRI groups according to the duration of ischemia (10 and 35 mins, respectively). Each animal was imaged at baseline; during ischemia; and at 1, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mins after ischemia. Amplitude decorrelation OCTA images were constructed with 1.5-, 3.0-, and 5.8-ms interscan times, to calculate the semiquantitative flow index in the superficial (50-70 μm) and the deep (220-340 μm) capillaries of the renal cortex. The mild IRI group showed no significant flow index change in both the superfial and the deep layers. The moderate IRI group showed a significantly decreased flow index from 15 and 45 mins in the superficial and deep layers, respectively. Seven weeks after IRI induction, the moderate IRI group showed lower kidney function and higher collagen deposition than the mild IRI group. OCTA imaging of the murine IRI model revealed changes in superficial blood flow after ischemic injury. A more pronounced decrease in superficial blood flow than in deep blood flow was associated with sustained dysfunction after IRI. Further investigation on post-IRI renal microvascular response using OCTA may improve our understanding of the relationship between the degree of ischemic insult and kidney function.",[],2022-12-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37076451,High level of lactate dehydrogenase and ischaemia-reperfusion injury regulate the multiple organ dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.,"Multiple organ damage has been observed in patients with COVID-19, but the exact pathway is not known. Vital organs of the human body may get affected after replication of SARS-CoV-2, including the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and brain. It triggers severe inflammation and impairs the function of two or more organ systems. Ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a phenomenon that can have disastrous effects on the human body.In this study, we analysed the laboratory data of 7052 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A total of 66.4% patients were men and 33.6% were women, which indicated gender difference as a prominent factor to be considered.Our data showed high levels of inflammation and elevated markers of tissue injury from multiple organs C reactive protein, white blood cell count, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and LDH. The number of red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit were lower than normal which indicated a reduction in oxygen supply and anaemia.On the basis of these results, we proposed a model linking IR injury to multiple organ damage by SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 may cause a reduction in oxygen towards an organ, which leads to IR injury.","['COVID-19', 'Molecular biology', 'VIROLOGY']",2022-01-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37076284,Prospects for the Use of Intranasally Administered Insulin and Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 in Cerebral Ischemia.,"Current approaches to the treatment of stroke have significant limitations, and neuroprotective therapy is ineffective. In view of this, searching for effective neuroprotectors and developing new neuroprotective strategies remain a pressing topic in research of cerebral ischemia. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) play a key role in the brain functioning by regulating the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons, neuronal plasticity, food intake, peripheral metabolism, and endocrine functions. Insulin and IGF-1 produce multiple effects in the brain, including neuroprotective action in cerebral ischemia and stroke. Experiments in animals and cell cultures have shown that under hypoxic conditions, insulin and IGF-1 improve energy metabolism in neurons and glial cells, promote blood microcirculation in the brain, restore nerve cell functions and neurotransmission, and produce the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on brain cells. The intranasal route of insulin and IGF-1 administration is of particular interest in the clinical practice, since it allows controlled delivery of these hormones directly to the brain, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Intranasally administered insulin alleviated cognitive impairments in elderly people with neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders; intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 promoted survival of animals with ischemic stroke. The review discusses the published data and results of our own studies on the mechanisms of neuroprotective action of intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 in cerebral ischemia, as well as the prospects of using these hormones for normalization of CNS functions and reduction of neurodegenerative changes in this pathology.","['cerebral ischemia', 'insulin-like growth factor-1', 'intranasal insulin', 'neuroprotective effect', 'oxidative stress', 'reperfusion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The goal of the present investigations is the synthesis of a newly designed H2S-releasing ibuprofen derivative, BM-88, and its pharmacological characterization regarding the cardioprotective effects in isolated rat hearts. Cytotoxicity of BM-88 was also estimated in H9c2 cells. H2S-release was measured by an H2S sensor from the coronary perfusate. Increasing concentrations of BM-88 (1.0 to 20.0 µM) were tested in vitro studies. Preadministration of 10 µM BM-88 significantly reduced the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) from its drug-free control value of 92% to 12%. However, no clear dose dependent reduction in the incidence of reperfusion-induced VF was observed while different concentrations of BM-88 were used. It was also found that 10 µM BM-88 provided a substantial protection and significantly reduced the infarct size in the ischemic/reperfused myocardium. However, this cardiac protection was not reflected in any significant changes in coronary flow and heart rates. The results support the fact that H2S release plays an important role mitigating reperfusion-induced cardiac damage.","['Arrhythmias', 'Cell death', 'H(2)S-donor', 'Heart', 'Ischemia/reperfusion']",2022-11-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37075968,Evidence that enolase-phosphatase 1 exacerbates early cerebral ischemia injury and blood-brain barrier breakdown by enhancing extracellular matrix destruction and inhibiting the interaction between ADI1 and MT1-MMP.,"Enolase-phosphatase 1 (ENOPH1) is a newly identified enzyme associated with stress responses and cell proliferation. Our previous study found that ENOPH1 mediates cerebral microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis under cerebral ischemia conditions. In this study, we systematically provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of ENOPH1 in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfuction induced by early ischemia. ENOPH1 knockout mice (ENOPH1 KO) and wild type (WT) mice were exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 min followed by 3 h of reperfusion in vivo, and brain microvascular endothelial cell lines (bEnd.3 cells) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. BEnd.3 cells were transfected with ENOPH1 shRNA to knockdown ENOPH1 expression. Brain ischemic damage and nerve function was assessed with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and neurological scores. BBB permeability and tight junction (TJ) protein and adherens junction (AJ) proteins expression were analyzed by FITC-dextran staining, western blotting and coimmunofluorescence. The MMP-2/9 activity was analyzed by gelatin zymography. Differential protein expression was assessed by quantitative proteomics. The interaction between ADI1 and MT1-MMP was measured by coimmunoprecipitation assay and coimmunofluorescence. Knockout of ENOPH1 ameliorated cerebral ischemic injury, decreased BBB permeability, inhibited the activity of MMP-2/9, upregulated the expression of TJ/AJ proteins and reversed extracellular matrix destruction after ischemia in vivo. Mechanistic studies have shown that ENOPH1 silencing enhanced the interaction between ADI1 and MT1-MMP by promoting the nuclear translocation of ADI1 to inhibit MT1-MMP in bEnd.3 cells after OGD and decreasing the expression of Tnc and Fn1 to inhibit ECM degradation. Our results reveal that ENOPH1 increases the activity of MMP-2/9, then promotes TJ protein and extracellular matrix degradation, and eventually destroys the stability of the BBB. Therefore, ENOPH1 is a new therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","['Blood-brain barrier', 'Cerebral ischemia', 'Enolase-phosphatase 1', 'Extracellular matrix', 'MT1-MMP/ MMP-2 axis']",2023-01-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37074502,IKK1 aggravates ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury by promoting the differentiation of effector T cells.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), and experimental work has revealed detailed insight into the inflammatory response in the kidney. T cells and NFκB pathway play an important role in IRI. Therefore, we examined the regulatory role and mechanisms of IkappaB kinase 1 (IKK1) in CD4+T lymphocytes in an experimental model of IRI. IRI was induced in CD4cre and CD4IKK1Δ mice. Compared to control mice, conditional deficiency of IKK1 in CD4+T lymphocyte significantly decreased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, and renal tubular injury score. Mechanistically, lack in IKK1 in CD4+T lymphocytes reduced the ability of CD4 lymphocytes to differentiate into Th1/Th17 cells. Similar to IKK1 gene ablation, pharmacological inhibition of IKK also protected mice from IRI. Together, lymphocyte IKK1 plays a pivotal role in IRI by promoting T cells differentiation into Th1/Th17 and targeting lymphocyte IKK1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for IRI.","['AKI: acute kidney injury', 'CD4+T cells', 'IKKalpha', 'Non-canonical NFκB', 'Th17 lymphocytes']",2022-12-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

CircRNAs are RNA circles that have been extensively involved in the disease. We aimed to investigate the mechanism of circ_0129657 in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assays were used to assess the expression of circ_0129657, miR-194-5p, and glia maturation factor beta (GMFB). Cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. 5-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyuridine (EdU) assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to assess the relationship between miR-194-5p and circ_0129657 or GMFB. Mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was applied to mimic the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our data showed that the levels of circ_0129657 and GMFB were significantly increased and the expression of miR-194-5p was significantly decreased in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Silencing circ_0129657 expression in OGD-induced HBMECs could promote cell viability and cell proliferation. Moreover, circ_0129657 depletion also could inhibit apoptosis and inflammatory factor secretion. Circ_0129657 functioned as a sponge for miR-194-5p and could regulate GMFB expression via miR-194-5p competition. Furthermore, miR-194-5p downregulation or GMFB restoration could partially reverse the effects of circ_0129657 silencing on cell biological properties in OGD-induced HBMECs. Meanwhile, circ_0129657 knockdown decreased cerebral infarction volume and neurological impairment in MCAO mouse models. In conclusion, our findings suggest that circ_0129657 can inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis and inflammatory factor secretion in HBMECs after oxygen-glucose deprivation via miR-194-5p/GMFB axis, providing evidence that circ_0129657 has the potential as a useful biological molecular marker in the diagnosis of stroke.","['GMFB', 'HBMECs', 'circ_0129657', 'miR-194-5p']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37073509,Butylphthalide protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats via reducing neuron ferroptosis and oxidative stress.,"Local ischemia in the cerebra leads to vascular injury and necrosis. Ferroptosis is involved in the pathophysiological process of many diseases and widely exists when ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in many organs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Butylphthalide (NBP) on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats model-caused neuron injury. Sprague Dawley Rats were randomly allocated to receive sham and MCAO operation. NBP low-dose (40 mg/kg b.w), and high-dose (80 mg/kg b.w) were administrated in MACO rats. Results showed NBP improves infarct volume, attenuates neuronal apoptosis in the brain tissue of MCAO rats. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased after NBP administration, while the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the ratio of GSH/GSSG in MACO rats increased. MACO caused non-heme iron accumulation in the brain tissue and Perl's staining confirmed NBP attenuates ferroptosis in MACO rats. The protein expressions of SCL7A11 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) decreased following MCAO, and NBP treatment subsequently increased the expression of SCL7A11 and GPX4. In vitro analysis in cortical neuron cells indicated that the GPX4 inhibitor reverses the inhibition of ferroptosis by NBP, which suggested that the SCL7A11/GPX4 pathway majorly contributed to the NBP ferroptosis protection effect.","['3-n-Butylphthalide', 'ferroptosis', 'glutathione peroxidase 4', 'middle cerebral artery infarction', 'oxidation']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, their contribution is not fully clarified.This study aimed to explore the role of LCN2 and its association with neutrophil polarization in I/R injury.A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce cerebral ischemia. LCN2mAb was administered 1h and Anti-Ly6G was administered for 3d before MCAO. The role of LCN2 in the polarity transition of neutrophils was explored using an in vitro HL-60 cell model.LCN2mAb pretreatment had neuroprotective effects in mice. The expression of Ly6G was not significantly different, but the expression of N2 neutrophils was increased. In the in vitro study, LCN2mAb-treated N1-HL-60 cells induced N2-HL-60 polarization.LCN2 may affect the prognosis of ischemic stroke by mediating neutrophil polarization.","['Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model', 'N2 neutrophils', 'Neutrophil polarization']",2022-08-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37072757,Microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolites indole-3-lactic acid is associated with intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury via positive regulation of YAP and Nrf2.,"Lactobacillus has been demonstrated to serve a protective role in intestinal injury. However, the relationship between Lactobacillus murinus (L. murinus)-derived tryptophan metabolites and intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury yet to be investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the role of L. murinus-derived tryptophan metabolites in intestinal I/R injury and the underlying molecular mechanism.Liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry analysis was used to measure the fecal content of tryptophan metabolites in mice undergoing intestinal I/R injury and in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. Immunofluorescence, quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and ELISA were performed to explore the inflammation protective mechanism of tryptophan metabolites in WT and Nrf2-deficient mice undergoing intestinal I/R, hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) induced intestinal organoids.By comparing the fecal contents of three L. murinus-derived tryptophan metabolites in mice undergoing intestinal I/R injury and in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery. We found that the high abundance of indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) in the preoperative feces was associated with better postoperative intestinal function, as evidenced by the correlation of fecal metabolites with postoperative gastrointestinal function, serum I-FABP and D-Lactate levels. Furthermore, ILA administration improved epithelial cell damage, accelerated the proliferation of intestinal stem cells, and alleviated the oxidative stress of epithelial cells. Mechanistically, ILA improved the expression of Yes Associated Protein (YAP) and Nuclear Factor erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) after intestinal I/R. The YAP inhibitor verteporfin (VP) reversed the anti-inflammatory effect of ILA, both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, we found that ILA failed to protect epithelial cells from oxidative stress in Nrf2 knockout mice under I/R injury.The content of tryptophan metabolite ILA in the preoperative feces of patients is negatively correlated with intestinal function damage under CPB surgery. Administration of ILA alleviates intestinal I/R injury via the regulation of YAP and Nrf2. This study revealed a novel therapeutic metabolite and promising candidate targets for intestinal I/R injury treatment.","['Indole-3-lactic acid', 'Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative stress', 'YAP']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Besides, a 100 mg/kg dose of Hesperidin was found to be more beneficial to the rats than 50 mg/kg.The study suggests that Hesperidin is protective against renal and lung tissues of rats that underwent ischemia-reperfusion injury.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37069635,"N-acetylcysteine in the Donor, Recipient, or Both Donor and Recipient in Liver Transplantation: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis.","N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a potentially effective drug for treating ischemia-reperfusion injury in transplanted livers, but its effect remains controversial.A systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant clinical trials published and registered in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrial.gov, WHO ICTRP, etc, before March 20, 2022 were conducted and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022315996). Data were pooled using a random effects model or a fixed effects model based on the amount of heterogeneity.Thirteen studies with 1121 participants, 550 of whom received NAC, were included. Compared with the control, NAC significantly reduced the incidence of primary graft nonfunction (relative risk [RR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-0.96), the incidence of postoperative complications (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.41-0.67), the peak postoperative aspartate transferase level (mean difference [MD], -267.52; 95% CI, -345.35 to -189.68), and the peak alanine transferase level (MD, -293.29; 95% CI, -370.39 to -216.20). NAC also improved 2-y (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.38) graft survival rate. However, NAC increased the intraoperative cryoprecipitate (MD, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.42-1.46) and red blood cell (MD, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.15-1.19) requirements. Moreover, NAC was administered in various modes in these studies, including to the donor, recipient, or both. Subgroup analysis and network meta-analysis showed that NAC administration to recipients could play a more significant role than the other 2 administration modes.Our study supports the protective effect of NAC against LT-induced ischemia-reperfusion injury and shows better clinical outcomes of NAC administration to recipients.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37068707,The combined effect of zinc oxide nanoparticles and milrinone on acute renal ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats: Potential underlying mechanisms.,"To investigate the efficacy of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) and/or milrinone (MIL) on renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) in rats and their possible underlying mechanisms.Forty-eight adult male Sprague-Dawley albino rats were randomly assigned into six equal-sized groups (n = 8): normal control, sham-operated, I/R group (45 min/24 h), ZnO-NPs group (10 mg/kg i.p.), MIL group (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), and ZnO-NPs + MIL group in the same previous doses.In comparison to the I/R-operated group, administration of either ZnO-NPs or MIL significantly decreased serum creatinine and urea concentrations, and renal vascular permeability (p < 0.05). The oxidative stress was significantly declined, as evidenced by increased GPx, CAT, and SOD activities and decreased MDA and NO concentrations. Renal expressions of TNF-α, NF-κB, KIM-1, NGAL, and caspase-3 decreased significantly, while Nrf2 increased significantly. Histopathology investigation revealed improvement with minimal renal lesions and fibrosis after ZnO-NPs or MIL treatments. The combined treatments synergistically improved the studied parameters more than either treatment alone. These findings were validated by molecular modeling, which revealed that MIL inhibited TNF-α, NF-kB, caspase-3, KIM-1 and NGAL.Both ZnO-NPs and MIL exerted cytoprotective effects against acute renal I/RI, and a combination of both was found to be even more effective. This renoprotective effect is suggested to be mediated through activation of Nrf2 and the prevention of the NF-κB activation-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, which may strengthen the potential role of ZnO-NPs or MIL in renal I/RI protection during surgical procedures.","['Acute renal ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Apoptosis', 'Inflammation', 'Milrinone', 'Oxidative stress', 'Zinc oxide nanoparticles']",2022-10-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37067736,Microglial and Neuronal Cell Pyroptosis Induced by Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation Aggravates Cell Injury via Activation of the Caspase-1/GSDMD Signaling Pathway.,"Pyroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death, which induces a strong pro-inflammatory reaction. However, the mechanism of pyroptosis after brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the interaction between different neural cell types are still unclear. This study comprehensively explored the mechanisms and interactions of microglial and neuronal pyroptosisin the simulated I/R environment in vitro. The BV2 (as microglial) and HT22(as neuronal) cells were treated by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Both BV2 and HT22 cells underwent pyroptosis after OGD/R, and the pyroptosis occurred at earlier time point in HT22than that of BV2. Caspase-11 and Gasdermin E expression in BV2 and HT22 cells did not change significantly after OGD/R. Inhibition of caspase-1 or GSDMD activity, or down-regulation of GSDMD expression, alleviated pyroptosis in both BV2 and HT22 cells after OGD/R. Transwell studies further showed that OGD/R-treated HT22 or BV2 cells aggravated pyroptosis of adjacent non-OGD/R-treated cells, which could be relieved by inhibition of caspase-1 or GSDMD. These results suggested that OGD/R induces pyroptosis of microglia and neuronal cells and aggravates cell injury via activation of caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that caspase-1 and GSDMD may be therapeutic targets after cerebral I/R.","['GasderminD (GSDMD)', 'Inflammation', 'Microglia', 'Necrosulfonamide', 'Neuron', 'Pyroptosis']",2023-01-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37066839,Low production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species after anoxia and reoxygenation in turtle hearts.,"Extremely anoxia-tolerant animals, such as freshwater turtles, survive anoxia and reoxygenation without sustaining tissue damage to their hearts. In contrast, for mammals, the ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury that leads to tissue damage during a heart attack is initiated by a burst of superoxide (O2·-) production from the mitochondrial respiratory chain upon reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Whether turtles avoid oxidative tissue damage because of an absence of mitochondrial superoxide production upon reoxygenation, or because the turtle heart is particularly protected against this damage, is unclear. Here, we investigated whether there was an increase in mitochondrial O2·- production upon the reoxygenation of anoxic red-eared slider turtle hearts in vivo and in vitro. This was done by measuring the production of H2O2, the dismutation product of O2·-, using the mitochondria-targeted mass-spectrometric probe in vivo MitoB, while in parallel assessing changes in the metabolites driving mitochondrial O2·- production, succinate, ATP and ADP levels during anoxia, and H2O2 consumption and production rates of isolated heart mitochondria. We found that there was no excess production of in vivo H2O2 during 1 h of reoxygenation in turtles after 3 h anoxia at room temperature, suggesting that turtle hearts most likely do not suffer oxidative injury after anoxia because their mitochondria produce no excess O2·- upon reoxygenation. Instead, our data support the conclusion that both the low levels of succinate accumulation and the maintenance of ADP levels in the anoxic turtle heart are key factors in preventing the surge of O2·- production upon reoxygenation.","['\n          Trachemys scripta\n        ', 'Anoxia', 'Heart', 'Hibernation', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidative damage', 'Reverse electron transfer']",2023-01-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of m6A-modified mRNAs in hepatic IR injury. In mouse models, liver samples were subjected to methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In total, 16917 m6A peaks associated with 4098 genes were detected in the sham group, whereas 21,557 m6A peaks associated with 5322 genes were detected in the IR group. There were 909 differentially expressed m6A peaks, 863 differentially methylated transcripts and 516 differentially m6A modification genes determined in both groups. The distribution of m6A peaks was especially enriched in the coding sequence and 3'UTR. Furthermore, we identified a relationship between differentially m6A methylated genes (fold change≥1.5/≤ 0.667, p value≤0.05) and differentially expressed genes (fold change≥1.5 and p value≤0.05) to obtain three overlapping predicted target genes (Fnip2, Phldb2, and Pcf11).

37066298,Brain and blood single-cell transcriptomics in acute and subacute phases after experimental stroke.,"Cerebral ischemia triggers a powerful inflammatory reaction involving both peripheral leukocytes and brain resident cells. Recent evidence indicates that their differentiation into a variety of functional phenotypes contributes to both tissue injury and repair. However, the temporal dynamics and diversity of post-stroke immune cell subsets remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we performed a longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic study of both brain and mouse blood to obtain a composite picture of brain-infiltrating leukocytes, circulating leukocytes, microglia and endothelium diversity over the ischemic/reperfusion time. Brain cells and blood leukocytes isolated from mice 2 or 14 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery were purified by FACS sorting and processed for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics. The analysis revealed a strong divergence of post-ischemic microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils over time, while such diversity was less evident in dendritic cells, B, T and NK cells. Conversely, brain endothelial cells and brain associated-macrophages showed altered transcriptomic signatures at 2 days post-stroke, but low divergence from sham at day 14. Pseudotime trajectory inference predicted the in-situ longitudinal progression of monocyte-derived macrophages from their blood precursors into day 2 and day 14 phenotypes, while microglia phenotypes at these two time points were not connected. In contrast to monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils were predicted to be continuously de-novo recruited from the blood. Brain single-cell transcriptomics from both female and male aged mice did not show major changes in respect to young mice, but aged and young brains differed in their immune cell composition. Furthermore, blood leukocyte analysis also revealed altered transcriptomes after stroke. However, brain-infiltrating leukocytes displayed higher transcriptomic divergence than their circulating counterparts, indicating that phenotypic diversification into cellular subsets occurs within the brain in the early and the recovery phase of ischemic stroke. In addition, this resource report contains a searchable database https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/ to allow user-friendly access to our data. The StrokeVis tool constitutes a comprehensive gene expression atlas that can be interrogated at the gene and cell type level to explore the transcriptional changes of endothelial and immune cell subsets from mouse brain and blood after stroke.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

After a successful PCI procedure, QTd and corrected QT (QTc) tremendously reduced at various time intervals with statistical significance in most of the studies. There was a clear association between ECG parameters QTd, QTc, and corrected QT dispersion (QTcd), and PCI, in that there is a considerable reduction in these ECG parameters after PCI treatment.","['angioplasty and stenting', 'corrected qt interval', 'ecg abnormalities', 'primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pci)', 'qt dispersion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37064952,Antioxidant Mechanisms Underlying the Gastroprotective Effect of Menthofuran on Experimentally Induced Gastric Lesions in Rodents.,"Menthofuran is a monoterpene present in various essential oils derived from species from Mentha genus, and in Brazil, those species are widely used in treating gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Considering the wide pharmacological potential of monoterpenes, including their antioxidant activity, this study aimed to evaluate menthofuran-gastroprotective activity, as well as the involvement of antioxidant mechanisms in this effect. The acute toxicity was evaluated according to the fixed dose method. The antiulcerogenic activity was investigated by using experimental models of gastric ulcers induced by ethanol, indomethacin, and ischemia/reperfusion in rats. The antisecretory gastric activity, the catalase activity, and the gastric wall mucus were determined in pylorus ligated rats. Gastric wall nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) group content, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evaluated in ethanol-induced the gastric ulcer model. Menthofuran (2 g/kg) presented low acute toxicity and showed gastroprotective activity against ethanol-, indomethacin-, and ischemia/reperfusion-induced ulcers. Moreover, menthofuran presented antisecretory activity, reduced the total acidity, and increased pH of gastric secretion. On the other hand, a decrease in mucus content of gastric wall without alteration of gastric juice volume and catalase activity was observed. Interestingly, menthofuran increased NPSH levels and reduced MDA levels and MPO activity. Gastroprotective effects of menthofuran appear to be mediated, at least in part, by the NOS pathway, endogenous prostaglandins, reduced gastric juice acidity, increased concentration of the NPSH groups, and reduced lipidic peroxidation. These findings support the menthofuran as an effective gastroprotective agent, as well as the marked participation of antioxidant mechanisms in this response.",[],2022-06-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37064880,CSF2RB overexpression promotes the protective effects of mesenchymal stromal cells against ischemic heart injury.,"Aims: The invasive intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) allows for limited repeat injections and shows poor therapeutic efficacy against ischemic heart failure. Intravenous injection is an alternative method because this route allows for repeated, noninvasive, and easy delivery. However, the lack of targeting of MSCs hinders the ability of these cells to accumulate in the ischemic area after intravenous injections. We investigated whether and how the overexpression of colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor beta subunit (CSF2RB) may regulate the cardiac homing of MSCs and their cardioprotective effects against ischemic heart failure. Methods and Results: Adult mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) or sham operations. We observed significantly higher CSF2 protein expression and secretion by the ischemic heart from 1 day to 2 weeks after MI/R. Mouse adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs) were infected with adenovirus harboring CSF2RB or control adenovirus. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled ADSCs were intravenously injected into MI/R mice every three days for a total of 7 times. Compared with ADSCs infected with control adenovirus, intravenously delivered ADSCs overexpressing CSF2RB exhibited markedly increased cardiac homing. Histological analysis revealed that CSF2RB overexpression significantly enhanced the ADSC-mediated proangiogenic, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic effects. More importantly, ADSCs overexpressing CSF2RB significantly increased the left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac contractility/relaxation in MI/R mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CSF2RB overexpression increases the migratory capacity and reduces the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis of ADSCs. We identified STAT5 phosphorylation as the key mechanism underlying the effects of CSF2RB on promoting ADSC migration and inhibiting ADSC apoptosis. RNA sequencing followed by cause-effect analysis revealed that CSF2RB overexpression increases the expression of the ubiquitin ligase RNF4. Coimmunoprecipitation and coimmunostaining experiments showed that RNF4 binds to phosphorylated STAT5. RNF4 knockdown reduced STAT5 phosphorylation as well as the antiapoptotic and promigratory actions of ADSCs overexpressing CSF2RB. Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that CSF2RB overexpression optimizes the efficacy of intravenously delivered MSCs in the treatment of ischemic heart injury by increasing the response of the MSCs to a CSF2 gradient and CSF2RB-dependent STAT5/RNF4 activation.","['CSF2RB', 'RNF4', 'STAT5', 'ischemic heart injury', 'mesenchymal stromal cells']",2022-11-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Various factors can cause thrombotic microangiopathy after kidney transplantation, including surgery, warm and cold ischemia-reperfusion injury, exposure to immunosuppressants, infection, and rejection. Many recent studies on atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have described genetic abnormalities related to excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. The affected patients' genetic backgrounds revealed significant genetic heterogeneity in several genes involved in complement regulation, including the complement factor H, complement factor H-related proteins, complement factor I, complement factor B, complement component 3, and CD46 genes in the alternative complement pathway. Although clinical studies have provided a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases, the diverse triggers present in the transplant environment can lead to thrombotic microangiopathy, along with various genetic predispositions, and it is difficult to identify the genetic background in various clinical conditions. Given the poor prognosis of posttransplant thrombotic microangiopathy, further research is necessary to improve the diagnosis and treatment protocols based on risk factors or genetic predisposition, and to develop new therapeutic agents.","['Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome', 'Kidney transplantation', 'Thrombotic microangiopathy']",2023-03-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of the quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique in evaluating the dynamic changes in the renal IRI process.A total of 36 New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to the IRI group (n=30) and the sham group (n=6). All rabbits underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, including T2-weighted imaging and QSM before the operation (pre-IRI) and 1, 12, 24, and 48 h after the operation (IRI-1h, IRI-12h, IRI-24h, and IRI-48h, respectively). Regions of interest were manually delineated in the outer medulla. All specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). The pathological score of renal injury and the average optical density value of GPX4 were calculated. The repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Spearman correlation analysis were used to compare the differences between the susceptibility values and determine the correlation.In the IRI group, the susceptibility values of the outer medulla at the pre-IRI, IRI-1h, IRI-12h, IRI-24h, and IRI-48h time points were (42.83±7.83)×10-3, (-5.33±6.28)×10-3, (6.50±3.94)×10-3, (12.00±3.74)×10-3, and (22.00±6.81)×10-3 ppm, respectively. The susceptibility values significantly differed among the different time points (P<0.001). The susceptibility values had a negative correlation with the scores of cell edema (ρ=-0.61; P=0.002) and the average optical density value of GPX4 (ρ=-0.70; P<0.001). The susceptibility values had a positive correlation with iron content (ρ=0.79; P<0.001), the scores of cell necrosis (ρ=0.71; P<0.001), interstitial inflammation (ρ=0.60; P=0.002), cast (ρ=0.75; P<0.001), and the total pathological score of renal injury (ρ=0.51; P=0.01).QSM can be used as a noninvasive method to assess the dynamic changes of the outer medulla in the early stage of renal IRI in rabbits.","['Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)', 'kidney', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)']",2022-08-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37064063,Successful replantation of total scalp amputation due to dog bites in geriatric patient with prolonged tissue ischemia and comorbidities: a case report.,"Traumatic scalp amputation is a rare and life-threatening case causing massive blood loss and serious tissue damage. This report aims to record a successful scalp replantation on a 69-year-old woman with total scalp amputation due to dog bites. The challenges of this case were age, prolonged tissue ischemia and several comorbidities such as high glucose index (uncontrolled diabetes mellitus), hypertension and obesity. After 2 hours of admission, 9 hours of stabilization and 7 hours of revascularization, left superficial temporal artery and vein end-to-end anastomosis was successful, adding to 18 hours total of warm tissue ischemia time. The patient was discharged on Day 8 without signs of reperfusion injury or infection. Elderly patients with comorbidities and long-term tissue ischemia may be at risk for reperfusion injury and infection. However, sufficient vascular anastomosis, good tissue quality and optimal evaluation can achieve a good result.",[],2023-02-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37064022,The effects of ECMO on neurological function recovery of critical patients: A double-edged sword.,"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) played an important role in the treatment of patients with critical care such as cardiac arrest (CA) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. ECMO is gradually showing its advantages in terms of speed and effectiveness of circulatory support, as it provides adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the patient and ensures the perfusion of organs. ECMO enhances patient survival and improves their neurological prognosis. However, ECMO-related brain complications are also important because of the high risk of death and the associated poor outcomes. We summarized the reported complications related to ECMO for patients with CA, such as north-south syndrome, hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, impaired intracranial vascular autoregulation, embolic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and brain death. The exact mechanism of ECMO on the role of brain function is unclear. Here we review the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with ECMO in the protection of neurologic function in recent years, as well as the ECMO-related complications in brain and the means to improve it, to provide ideas for the treatment of brain function protection in CA patients.","['brain', 'cardiac arrest', 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'neurologic complications', 'neuroprotection']",2022-12-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37063896,Interferon-β modulates microglial polarization to ameliorate delayed tPA-exacerbated brain injury in ischemic stroke.,"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Delayed tPA administration is associated with increased risks of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. Studies have shown that interferon beta (IFNβ) or type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) signaling confers protection against ischemic stroke in preclinical models. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that IFNβ can be co-administered with tPA to alleviate delayed tPA-induced adverse effects in ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the time limit of IFNβ treatment on the extension of tPA therapeutic window and assessed the effect of IFNβ on modulating microglia (MG) phenotypes in ischemic stroke with delayed tPA treatment. Mice were subjected to 40 minutes transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by delayed tPA treatment in the presence or absence of IFNβ at 3h, 4.5h or 6h post-reperfusion. In addition, mice with MG-specific IFNAR1 knockdown were generated to validate the effects of IFNβ on modulating MG phenotypes, ameliorating brain injury, and lessening BBB disruption in delayed tPA-treated MCAO mice. Our results showed that IFNβ extended tPA therapeutic window to 4.5h post-reperfusion in MCAO mice, and that was accompanied with attenuated brain injury and lessened BBB disruption. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that IFNβ modulated MG polarization, leading to the suppression of inflammatory MG and the promotion of anti-inflammatory MG, in delayed tPA-treated MCAO mice. Notably, these effects were abolished in MG-specific IFNAR1 knockdown MCAO mice. Furthermore, the protective effect of IFNβ on the amelioration of delayed tPA-exacerbated ischemic brain injury was also abolished in these mice. Finally, we identified that IFNβ-mediated modulation of MG phenotypes played a role in maintaining BBB integrity, because the knockdown of IFNAR1 in MG partly reversed the protective effect of IFNβ on lessening BBB disruption in delayed tPA-treated MCAO mice. In summary, our study reveals a novel function of IFNβ in modulating MG phenotypes, and that may subsequently confer protection against delayed tPA-exacerbated brain injury in ischemic stroke.","['blood brain barrier', 'interferon beta', 'ischemic stroke', 'microglial polarization', 'tissue plasminogen activator', 'type I interferon receptor']",2023-01-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37063847,Single-cell analyses reveal the dynamic functions of Itgb2+ microglia subclusters at different stages of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in transient middle cerebral occlusion mice model.,"The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) is intricate, and current studies suggest that neuron, astrocyte, microglia, endothelial cell, and pericyte all have different phenotypic changes of specific cell types after ischemic stroke. And microglia account for the largest proportion after CIRI. Previous transcriptomic studies of ischemic stroke have typically focused on the 24 hours after CIRI, obscuring the dynamics of cellular subclusters throughout the disease process. Therefore, traditional methods for identifying cell types and their subclusters may not be sufficient to fully unveil the complexity of single-cell transcriptional profile dynamics caused by an ischemic stroke.In this study, to explore the dynamic transcriptional profile of single cells after CIRI, we used single-cell State Transition Across-samples of RNA-seq data (scSTAR), a new bioinformatics method, to analyze the single-cell transcriptional profile of day 1, 3, and 7 of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mice. Combining our bulk RNA sequences and proteomics data, we found the importance of the integrin beta 2 (Itgb2) gene in post-modeling. And microglia of Itgb2+ and Itgb2- were clustered by the scSTAR method. Finally, the functions of the subpopulations were defined by Matescape, and three different time points after tMCAO were found to exhibit specific functions.Our analysis revealed a dynamic transcriptional profile of single cells in microglia after tMCAO and explored the important role of Itgb2 contributed to microglia by combined transcriptomics and proteomics analysis after modeling. Our further analysis revealed that the Itgb2+ microglia subcluster was mainly involved in energy metabolism, cell cycle, angiogenesis, neuronal myelin formation, and repair at 1, 3, and 7 days after tMCAO, respectively.Our results suggested that Itgb2+ microglia act as a time-specific multifunctional immunomodulatory subcluster during CIRI, and the underlying mechanisms remain to be further investigated.","['Itgb2', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'microglia', 'scSTAR', 'single cell RNA-seq']",2022-12-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37063344,MicroRNA-146a Improved Acute Lung Injury Induced by hepatic Ischemia-reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting PRDX1.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by high incidence and poor prognosis. The regulatory role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) in HIRI has been reported, but if miR-146a could affect the progression of HIRI-induced ALI has not been reported. The mice HIRI model was established by ligating left hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery for 60 minutes and then treating with reperfusion for 4 hours. Hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) was performed to establish cell model. The binding site between miR-146a and Peroxidase 1 (PRDX1) was predicted and validated. The levels of inflammation factors and redox markers were detected with commercial kits. Significant lower expression of miR-146a and higher expression of PRDX1 in HIRI animal model were observed. miR-146a inhibited the liver injury after HIRI induction through targeting PRDX1. miR-146a inhibited the lung injury caused by HIRI via regulating PRDX1. The inhibition of cell apoptosis and inflammation factors by miR-146a were reversed by pcDNA-PRDX1. This research demonstrated that miR-146a improved ALI caused by HIRI by inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative condition through targeting PRDX1. This study might provide a novel thought for the prevention and treatment of ALI caused by HIRI by regulating miR-146a/PRDX1 axis.","['PRDX1', 'acute lung injury', 'hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'hypoxia-reoxygenation', 'miR-146a']",2022-10-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37063298,Rev-erbα agonist SR9009 protects against cerebral ischemic injury through mechanisms involving Nrf2 pathway.,"Backgrounds: The circadian clock protein Rev-erbα is a crucial regulator of circadian rhythms that affects multiple molecular, cellular, and physiology pathways that control susceptibility, injury, and recovery in the neurological disorders. Emerging evidence suggest that Rev-erbα plays a key role in the inflammation and oxidative stress, two pivotal mechanisms in the pathogenesis, progression, and recovery process of ischemic stroke. However, it remains inconclusive whether Rev-erbα activation is protective against ischemic brain damage. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, a master regulator of inflammatory and oxidative responses. Our study aimed to determine whether pharmacological activation of Rev-erbα by SR9009 protects against acute ischemic brain damage partly via Nrf2 pathway. Methods: Adult mice were pretreated with SR9009 or Nrf2 inhibitor all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for 3 days prior to Sham or middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. After ischemia for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h, the neurological function and cerebral infarction volume were determined, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in serum were detected by kit. The mRNA and/or protein level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Period (Per)1, Brain and muscle arnt-like1 (Bmal1), Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), Rev-erbα, Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in cerebral cortex were detected by q-PCR and Western blot. Results: We confirmed that SR9009 activated Rev-erbα gene in the cerebral cortex under basal condition. At 24 h after reperfusion, SR9009 ameliorated acute neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume. Meanwhile, the inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and MDA content levels were significant decreased, SOD and GSH-PX activity were obviously increased, which were markedly blunted (or abolished) by ATRA. SR9009 enhanced the induction of Nrf2 and its downstream target genes HO-1 and NQO1 after ischemic insult. In addition, we found that SR9009 restored Rev-erbα, Bmal1, Clock, Per1 genes expression in the cerebral cortex under ischemic condition. Conclusion: Taken together, Rev-erbα activation by SR9009 protects against ischemic stroke damage, at least, partly through Nrf2 pathway.","['Nrf2', 'REV-erbα', 'SR9009', 'cerebral ischemia', 'circadian gene', 'circadian rhythm']",2022-11-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37063075,Gentiopicroside enhances the protective effect of trimetazidine against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via the AMPK/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/R) leads to the inevitable clinical consequences of myocardial infarction and subsequent heart failure. Trimetazidine (TMZ), an anti-ischemic agent, exerts protective potential in MI/R but had limited efficacy for some patients. Here we sought to investigate the single and combined application of gentiopicroside (GPS) and TMZ in MI/R. Notably, GPS had little cytotoxicity to cardiomyocytes. GPS attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death, reactive oxygen species production, lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde releases, and antioxidant stress enzyme superoxide dismutase activity, indicating the protective efficacy of GPS against H/R-induced oxidative injury. Importantly, GPS enhanced the protective efficacy of TMZ against H/R-mediated cardiomyocyte injury. Additionally, GPS mitigated the transcription and releases of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes, which were enhanced after co-treatment with TMZ. Mechanistically, GPS activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling to inhibit H/R-induced NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which was further enhanced after costimulation with TMZ. Importantly, blocking the AMPK signaling reversed the protective roles of GPS and its combination with TMZ in H/R-induced oxidative insult and inflammation. In vivo, both GPS and TMZ alleviated the abnormal cardiac structure, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac dysfunction in MI/R rats, which were further enhanced after administration with GPS and TMZ together. Furthermore, GPS intensified TMZ-mediated inhibition of oxidative injury, inflammation, and the AMPK/NLRP3 signaling in MI/R rats. Collectively, GPS enhances the protective efficacy of TMZ against MI/R injury through AMPK activation-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, implying a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of MI/R.","['gentiopicroside', 'inflammation', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'oxidative stress', 'trimetazidine']",2022-08-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37062886,High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats: Involving the mitigation of ferroptosis and inflammation.,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been found to attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, its effects and mechanism of action have not yet been clarified. It has been reported that cerebral I/R injury is closely associated not only with ferroptosis but also with inflammation. Hence, the current study aimed to investigate whether high-frequency rTMS attenuates middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral I/R injury and further to elucidate the mediatory role of ferroptosis and inflammation.The protective effects of rTMS on experimental cerebral I/R injury were investigated using transient MCAO model rats. Neurological scores and pathological changes of cerebral ischemic cortex were assessed to evaluate the effects of rTMS on cerebral I/R injury. The involvement of ferroptosis and that of inflammation were examined to investigate the mechanism underlying the effects of rTMS.High-frequency rTMS remarkably rescued the MCAO-induced neurological deficits and morphological damage. rTMS treatment also increased the mRNA and protein expression of glutathione-dependent peroxidase 4, decreased the mRNA and protein levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 and transferrin receptor in the cortex. Moreover, rTMS administration reduced the cerebrospinal fluid IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α concentrations.These findings implicated that high-frequency rTMS alleviates MCAO-induced cerebral I/R injury, and the underlying mechanism could involve the inhibition of ferroptosis and inflammation. Our study identifies rTMS as a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury. Moreover, the mechanistic insights into ferroptosis and inflammation advance our understanding of it as a potential therapeutic target for diseases beyond cerebral ischemia stroke.","['cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'ferroptosis', 'inflammation', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation']",2022-09-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37062134,Optimization of green extraction process with natural deep eutectic solvent and comparative in vivo pharmacokinetics of bioactive compounds from Astragalus-Safflower pair.,"Natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDESs) are promising not only in componential extraction, but also in drug delivery system due to their green and safe features. In this work, NaDESs were applied to extract bioactive components from Astragalus-Safflower pair, a classic traditional Chinese medicine combination. Furthermore, ready-to-use crude extracts were administrated to SD rats.Total 9 NaDESs composed of food grade ingredients were screened for the extraction of representative 9 components (hydroxysafflor yellow A, anhydrosafflor yellow B, eleutheroside B, calycosin-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, ononin, calycosin, astraganoside, and carthamin) from Astragalus-Safflower pair. Afterwards, genetic artificial neural network (GNN) was adopted for optimizing the ultrasound-assisted extraction process. After SD rats were orally administrated with the ready-to-use crude extracts extracted under the optimized conditions, the in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics of 5 components were evaluated comprehensively from weight, gender, solvent and modeling surgery, under a well-established UPLC-MS/MS method.Betaine-Lactic acid (Bet-Lac) was eventually determined as the optimal extraction solvent for subsequent experiments. The optimal ultrasound assisted extraction process was as follows: 90 min of extraction time, 65 °C of temperature, 80% of Bet-Lac content and 50 mg/ml of solid-liquid ratio. Bet-Lac enhanced to varying degrees the bioavailability of analytes in normal and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injured (CI/RI) rats in contrast with corresponding rats administrated with water extract groups (p < 0.05). Besides, the bioavailability of active components in CI/RI rat plasma was significantly lower than that in normal rats (p < 0.05), indicating pathological damage of CI/R had a significant impact on pharmacokinetic profile of compounds in rats. However, gender and body weight had no significant effects on the pharmacokinetic profile of bioactive components.NaDESs exhibited higher extraction efficiency than conventional solvents. And GNN is reliable to optimize the ultrasound assisted extraction process. This study supported the potential of non-toxic NaDESs as solvents for extraction process and drug delivery systems at the same time.","['Astragalus-safflower pair', 'Genetic neural network optimizing', 'Ischemia/reperfusion damage', 'Natural deep eutectic solvent', 'Pharmacokinetics']",2023-01-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37061907,Cardiomyocytic cyclic GMP-AMP synthase is critical for the induction of experimental cardiac graft rejection.,"During cardiac transplantation, cellular injury and DNA damage can result in the accumulation of cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which can activate the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon gene (STING) signaling pathway and thus induce multiple proinflammatory responses. However, the role of the cGAS-STING pathway in cardiac transplantation remains unclear. This study explored the role of cardiomyocytic cGAS in mouse heart transplantation during the ischemia/reperfusion and rejection processes.Cytosolic dsDNA accumulation and cGAS-STING signaling pathway component upregulation were observed in the grafts posttransplantation. The use of cGAS-deficient donor tissues led to significantly prolonged graft survival. The underlying mechanisms involved decreased expression and phosphorylation of downstream proteins, including TANK binding kinase 1 and nuclear factor κB. In parallel, notably diminished expression levels of various proinflammatory cytokines were observed. Accordingly, substantially decreased proportions of macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+) and CD8+ T cells were observed in the spleen. The activation of CD8+ T cells (CD8+CD69+) within the graft and the proportion of effector memory (CD44highCD62Llow) lymphocytes in the spleen were notably decreased. Treatment with the cGAS inhibitor Ru.521 led to significantly prolonged graft survival.Cardiomyocytic cGAS plays a critical role by sensing cytosolic dsDNA during cardiac transplantation and could serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent graft rejection.","['cGAS', 'graft rejection', 'heart transplant', 'innate immune', 'pro-inflammatory cytokines']",2022-09-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37061010,Ferritinophagy in the etiopathogenic mechanism of related diseases.,"Iron is an essential trace element that is involved in a variety of physiological processes. Ferritinophagy is selective autophagy mediated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), which regulates iron homeostasis in the body. Upon iron depletion or starvation, ferritinophagy is activated, releasing large amounts of Fe2+ and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to ferroptosis. This plays a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of many diseases, such as metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, tumors, cardiomyopathy, and ischemia-reperfusion ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here, we first review the regulation and functions of ferritinophagy and then describe its involvement in different diseases, with hopes of providing new understanding and insights into iron metabolism and iron disorder-related diseases and the therapeutic opportunity for targeting ferritinophagy.","['Ferritinophagy', 'Ferroptosis', 'Iron', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2022-09-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37061004,Mitochondrial membrane potential instability on reperfusion after ischemia does not depend on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.,"Physiologic Ca2+ entry via the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) participates in energetic adaption to workload but may also contribute to cell death during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The MCU has been identified as the primary mode of Ca2+ import into mitochondria. Several groups have tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ import via MCU is detrimental during I/R injury using genetically-engineered mouse models, yet the results from these studies are inconclusive. Furthermore, mitochondria exhibit unstable or oscillatory membrane potentials (ΔΨm) when subjected to stress, such as during I/R, but it is unclear if the primary trigger is an excess influx of mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, or other factors. Here, we critically examine whether MCU-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during I/R is involved in ΔΨm instability, or sustained mitochondrial depolarization, during reperfusion by acutely knocking out MCU in neonatal mouse ventricular myocyte (NMVM) monolayers subjected to simulated I/R. Unexpectedly, we find that MCU knockout does not significantly alter mCa2+ import during I/R, nor does it affect ΔΨm recovery during reperfusion. In contrast, blocking the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger (mNCE) suppressed the mCa2+ increase during Ischemia but did not affect ΔΨm recovery or the frequency of ΔΨm oscillations during reperfusion, indicating that mitochondrial ΔΨm instability on reperfusion is not triggered by mCa2+. Interestingly, inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport or supplementation with antioxidants stabilized I/R-induced ΔΨm oscillations. The findings are consistent with mCa2+ overload being mediated by reverse-mode mNCE activity and supporting ROS-induced ROS release as the primary trigger of ΔΨm instability during reperfusion injury.","['image processing', 'ischemia', 'mitochondrial membrane potential', 'oscillation', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'reperfusion', 'time-series analysis', 'wavelet']",2022-02-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37060502,Irisin Attenuates Apoptosis Following Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Through Improved Mitochondria Dynamics and ROS Suppression Mediated Through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR Axis.,"Irisin is a muscle-derived hormone that promotes the survival of motor neurons and enhances muscle size following injury. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects and mechanism(s) of action of irisin in response to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Right-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) models were generated in C57BL/6 J mice. Mouse neuronal cell lines (NSC-34) were used to confirm the molecular mechanisms of the protection afforded by irisin in response to CIRI. We found that irisin (250 μg/kg) improved cerebral function and reduced the cerebral infarct volume following CIRI. Irisin also protected neuronal cells against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced apoptosis, assessed via TUNEL, and cleaved Caspase-3 staining. Western blotting of neuronal tissue from irisin treated I/R mice showed lower expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-9 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01) and increased levels of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 (P < 0.01 & P < 0.001 vs. I/R). Irisin also reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) characterized through malondialdehyde (MDA) assays. Irisin was found to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through the suppression of mitochondrial fission-linked dynamin-related protein 1 in CIRI mice (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 v. I/R cohort). Moreover, mitochondrial fusion-related protein (Mfn2) and Opa1 expression were rescued following irisin treatment (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 v. I/R cohort). Cell-based assays showed that irisin activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the neurons of CIRI mice. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of irisin on NSC-34 cell-survival, mitochondrial function, and ROS generation were reversed by VS-5584, a highly specific PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor. Collectively, these data highlight the ability of irisin to alleviate CIRI in vivo and in vitro. The mechanisms of action of irisin include the attenuation of apoptosis through the prevention of mitochondrial fission and increased mitochondrial fusion and the alleviation of oxidative stress through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. We therefore identify irisin as a much-needed therapeutic for CIRI.","['Apoptosis', 'Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Mitochondria', 'Reactive oxygen species, PI3K/AKT/mTOR']",2022-08-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37059928,GATA6 Inhibits Neuronal Autophagy and Ferroptosis in Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion Injury Through a miR-193b/ATG7 axis-dependent Mechanism.,"Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated necrotic cell death, which is engaged in the pathological cell death related to stroke, contributing to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Therefore, we performed this study to clarify the role of GATA6 in neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis in cerebral I/R injury. The cerebral I/R injury-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as well as the downstream factors of GATA6 were predicted bioinformatically. Moreover, the relations between GATA6 and miR-193b and that between miR-193b and ATG7 were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Besides, neurons were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), followed by overexpression of GATA6, miR-193b, and ATG7 alone or in combination to assess neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis. At last, in vivo experiments were performed to explore the impacts of GATA6/miR-193b/ATG7 on neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-stimulated cerebral I/R injury. It was found that GATA6 and miR-193b were poorly expressed in cerebral I/R injury. GATA6 transcriptionally activated miR-193b to downregulate ATG7. Additionally, GATA6-mediated miR-193b activation suppressed neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis in OGD-treated neurons by inhibiting ATG7. Furthermore, GATA6/miR-193b relieved cerebral I/R injury by restraining neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis via downregulation of ATG7 in vivo. In summary, GATA6 might prevent neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis to alleviate cerebral I/R injury via the miR-193b/ATG7 axis.","['ATG7', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Ferroptosis', 'GATA6', 'Neuronal autophagy', 'microRNA-193b']",2022-07-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37059588,Long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS regulates ischemic neuronal death by targeting miR-337-3p/YBX1 signaling pathway: protective effect of dexmedetomidine.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a common neurological disease. Homeobox A11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been demonstrated as an important regulator in diverse human cancers. However, its function and regulatory mechanism in ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) have received wide attraction because of its neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to explore the possible link between Dex and HOXA11-AS in protecting neuronal cells from by ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. We used oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) mouse model to test the link. We found that Dex significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced DNA fragmentation, cell viability and apoptosis, and rescued the decreased HOXA11-AS expression after ischemic damage in Neuro-2a cells. Gain-/loss-of-function studies revealed that HOXA11-AS promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells exposed to OGD/R. Knockdown of HOXA11-AS decreased the protective effect of Dex on OGD/R cells. HOXA11-AS was found to transcriptionally regulate microRNA-337-3p (miR-337-3p) expression as evidenced by luciferase reporter assay, while miR-337-3p expression was upregulated following ischemia in vitro and in vivo. Besides, knockdown of miR-337-3p protected OGD/R-induced apoptotic death of Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, HOXA11-AS functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and competed with Y box protein 1 (Ybx1) mRNA for directly binding to miR-337-3p, which protected ischemic neuronal death. Dex treatment protected against ischemic damage and improved overall neurological functions in vivo. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of Dex neuroprotection for ischemic stroke through regulating lncRNA HOXA11-AS by targeting the miR-337-3p/Ybx1 signaling pathway, which might help develop new strategies for the therapeutic interventions in cerebral ischemic stroke.","['apoptosis', 'dexmedetomidine', 'ischemia stroke', 'long non-coding RNA', 'miR-337-3p']",2023-01-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37059569,Impact of a series of measures for optimisation hospital code stroke care on door-to-needle times.,"Time continues to be a fundamental variable in reperfusion treatments for acute ischaemic stroke. Despite the recommendations made in clinical guidelines, only around one-third of these patients receive fibrinolysis within 60minutes. In this study, we describe our experience with the implementation of a specific protocol for patients with acute ischaemic stroke and evaluate its impact on door-to-needle times in our hospital.Measures were gradually implemented in late 2015 to shorten stroke management times and optimise the care provided to patients with acute ischaemic stroke; these measures included the creation of a specific on-call neurovascular care team. We compare stroke management times before (2013-2015) and after (2017-2019) the introduction of the protocol.The study includes 182 patients attended before implementation of the protocol and 249 attended after. Once all measures were in effect, the overall median door-to-needle time was 45minutes (vs 74 minutes before, a 39% reduction; P<.001), with 73.5% of patients treated within 60minutes (a 47% increase; P<.001). Median overall time to treatment (onset-to-needle time) was reduced by 20minutes (P<.001).The measures included in our protocol achieved a significant, sustained reduction in door-to-needle times, although there remains room for improvement. The mechanisms established for monitoring outcomes and for continuous improvement will enable further advances in this regard.","['Accidente cerebrovascular', 'Acute stroke', 'Cerebrovascular accident', 'Door-to-needle time', 'Fibrinólisis intravenosa', 'Ictus agudo', 'Ictus isquémico', 'Intravenous fibrinolysis', 'Ischaemic stroke', 'Tiempo puerta-aguja']",2020-04-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37059375,Multi-pathway neuroprotective effects of a novel salidroside derivative SHPL-49 against acute cerebral ischemic injury.,"SHPL-49 ((2R,3S,4S,5R,6R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl) butoxy) tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol) is a novel glycoside derivative obtained from structural modification of salidroside, which is isolated from the medicinal plant Rhodiola rosea L. SHPL-49 was administered to rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) for 5 days, and it was found that SHPL-49 could alleviate the cerebral infarct volume and reduce the neurological deficit score. Moreover, the effective time window of SHPL-49 in the pMCAO model was from 0.5 to 8 h after embolization. In addition, the result of immunohistochemistry showed that SHPL-49 could increase the number of neurons in the brain tissue and reduce the occurrence of apoptosis. Morris water maze and Rota-rod experiments showed that SHPL-49 could improve neurological deficits, repair neurocognitive and motor dysfunction, and enhance learning and memory ability in the pMCAO model after 14 days of SHPL-49 treatment. Further in vitro experiments showed that SHPL-49 significantly reduced the calcium overload of PC-12 cells and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), decreased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, SHPL-49 could reduce cell apoptosis by increasing protein expression ratio of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 to pro-apoptotic factor Bax in vitro. SHPL-49 also regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in ischemic brain tissue, and even inhibited the caspase cascade of pro-apoptotic proteins Cleaved-caspase 9 and Cleaved-caspase 3. Taken together, SHPL-49 exhibited neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury through multiple pathways, such as alleviating calcium overload, reducing oxidative stress damage, and inhibiting apoptosis.","['Apoptosis', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Neuroprotective', 'Oxidative stress', 'Salidroside derivative']",2023-01-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37058817,Phytochemicals targeting lncRNAs: A novel direction for neuroprotection in neurological disorders.,"Neurological disorders with various etiologies impacting the nervous system are prevalent in clinical practice. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) molecules are functional RNA molecules exceeding 200 nucleotides in length that do not encode proteins, but participate in essential activities. Research indicates that lncRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, and may be potential targets for their treatment. Phytochemicals in traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) have been found to exert neuroprotective effects by targeting lncRNAs and regulating gene expression and various signaling pathways. We aim to establish the development status and neuroprotective mechanism of phytochemicals that target lncRNAs through a thorough literature review. A total of 369 articles were retrieved through manual and electronic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and CNKI databases from inception to September 2022. The search utilized combinations of natural products, lncRNAs, neurological disorders, and neuroprotective effects as keywords. The included studies, a total of 31 preclinical trials, were critically reviewed to present the current situation and the progress in phytochemical-targeted lncRNAs in neuroprotection. Phytochemicals have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies of various neurological disorders by regulating lncRNAs. These disorders include arteriosclerotic ischemia-reperfusion injury, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, glioma, peripheral nerve injury, post-stroke depression, and depression. Several phytochemicals exert neuroprotective roles through mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, autophagy regulation, and antagonism of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Some phytochemicals targeted lncRNAs and served a neuroprotective role by regulating microRNA and mRNA expression. The emergence of lncRNAs as pathological regulators provides a novel direction for the study of phytochemicals in CHM. Elucidating the mechanism of phytochemicals regulating lncRNAs will help to identify new therapeutic targets and promote their application in precision medicine.","['LncRNAs', 'Neurological disorders', 'Neuroprotection', 'Pharmacology', 'Phytochemicals', 'Traditional Chinese herbal medicine']",2023-03-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37058187,Evaluation of prophylactic efficacy of sodium thiosulfate in combating I/R injury in rat brain: exploring its efficiency further in vascular calcified brain slice model.,"Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIR) is one of the clinical manifestations encountered during the management of stroke. High prevalence of intracranial arterial calcification is reported in stroke patients. However, the impact of vascular calcification (VC) in the outcome of CIR and the efficacy of mechanical preconditioning (IPC) and pharmacological conditioning with sodium thiosulphate (STS) in ameliorating IR remains unclear. Two experimental models namely carotid artery occlusion (n = 36) and brain slice models (n = 18) were used to evaluate the efficacy of STS in male Wistar rats. IR was inflicted in rat by occluding carotid artery for 30 min followed by 24-h reperfusion after STS (100 mg/kg) administration. Brain slice model was used to reconfirm the results to account blood brain barrier permeability. Further, brain slice tissue was utilised to evaluate the efficacy of STS in VC rat brain by measuring the histological alterations and biochemical parameters. Pre-treatment of STS prior to CIR in intact animal significantly reduced the IR-associated histopathological alterations in brain, declined oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function found to be similar to IPC. Brain slice model data also confirmed the neuroprotective effect of STS similar to IPC in IR challenged tissue slice. Higher tissue injury was noted in VC brain IR tissue than normal IR tissue. Therapeutic efficacy of STS was evident in VC rat brain tissues and normal tissues subjected to IR. On the other hand, IPC-mediated protection was noted only in IR normal and adenine-induced VC brain tissues not in high-fat diet (HFD) induced VC brain tissues. Based on the results, we concluded that similar to IPC, STS was effective in attenuating IR injury in CIR rat brain. Vascular calcification adversely affected the recovery protocol of brain tissues from ischemic insult. STS was found to be an effective agent in ameliorating the IR injury in both adenine and HFD induced vascular calcified rat brain, but IPC-mediated neuroprotection was absent in HFD-induced VC brain tissues.","['Brain slice', 'Calcification', 'Cerebral ischemia reperfusion', 'Ischemic preconditioning', 'Sodium thiosulphate']",2022-11-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37057625,Enhanced Mitochondria-SR Tethering Triggers Adaptive Cardiac Muscle Remodeling.,"Cardiac contractile function requires high energy from mitochondria, and Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Via local Ca2+ transfer at close mitochondria-SR contacts, cardiac excitation feedforward regulates mitochondrial ATP production to match surges in demand (excitation-bioenergetics coupling). However, pathological stresses may cause mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, excessive reactive oxygen species production and permeability transition, risking homeostatic collapse and myocyte loss. Excitation-bioenergetics coupling involves mitochondria-SR tethers but the role of tethering in cardiac physiology/pathology is debated. Endogenous tether proteins are multifunctional; therefore, nonselective targets to scrutinize interorganelle linkage. Here, we assessed the physiological/pathological relevance of selective chronic enhancement of cardiac mitochondria-SR tethering.We introduced to mice a cardiac muscle-specific engineered tether (linker) transgene with a fluorescent protein core and deployed 2D/3D electron microscopy, biochemical approaches, fluorescence imaging, in vivo and ex vivo cardiac performance monitoring and stress challenges to characterize the linker phenotype.Expressed in the mature cardiomyocytes, the linker expanded and tightened individual mitochondria-junctional SR contacts; but also evoked a marked remodeling with large dense mitochondrial clusters that excluded dyads. Yet, excitation-bioenergetics coupling remained well-preserved, likely due to more longitudinal mitochondria-dyad contacts and nanotunnelling between mitochondria exposed to junctional SR and those sealed away from junctional SR. Remarkably, the linker decreased female vulnerability to acute massive β-adrenergic stress. It also reduced myocyte death and mitochondrial calcium-overload-associated myocardial impairment in ex vivo ischemia/reperfusion injury.We propose that mitochondria-SR/endoplasmic reticulum contacts operate at a structural optimum. Although acute changes in tethering may cause dysfunction, upon chronic enhancement of contacts from early life, adaptive remodeling of the organelles shifts the system to a new, stable structural optimum. This remodeling balances the individually enhanced mitochondrion-junctional SR crosstalk and excitation-bioenergetics coupling, by increasing the connected mitochondrial pool and, presumably, Ca2+/reactive oxygen species capacity, which then improves the resilience to stresses associated with dysregulated hyperactive Ca2+ signaling.","['ischemia', 'mitochondria', 'muscle cells', 'myocardium', 'reperfusion', 'sarcoplasmic reticulum', 'transgenes']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056986,Neuroprotection of NAD+ and NBP against ischemia/reperfusion brain injury is associated with restoration of sirtuin-regulated metabolic homeostasis.,"Background: Ischemic stroke seriously threatens human health because of high rates of morbidity, mortality and disability. This study compared the effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and butylphthalide (NBP) on in vitro and in vivo ischemic stroke models. Methods: Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (t-MCAO/R) model was established in mice, and the cultured primary cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Cerebral infarct volume, neurobehavioral indices, antioxidant activity, ATP level and lactic acid content were determined. The neuroprotective effects of NAD+ or NBP were compared using sirtuin inhibitor niacinamide (NAM). Results: Intraperitoneal injection of NBP within 4 h or intravenous injection of NAD+ within 1 h after t-MCAO/R significantly reduced the volume of infarcts, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits. Administration of NAD+ and NBP immediately after t-MCAO/R in mice showed similar neuroprotection against acute and long-term ischemic injury. Both NAD+ and NBP significantly inhibited the accumulation of MDA and H2O2 and reduced oxidative stress. NAD+ was superior to NBP in inhibiting lipid oxidation and DNA damage. Furthermore, although both NAD+ and NBP improved the morphology of mitochondrial damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion, NAD+ more effectively reversed the decrease of ATP and increase of lactic acid after ischemia/reperfusion compared with NBP. NAD+ but not NBP treatment significantly upregulated SIRT3 in the brain, but the sirtuin inhibitor NAM could abolish the protective effect of NAD+ and NBP by inhibiting SIRT1 or SIRT3. Conclusions: These results confirmed the protective effects of NAD+ and NBP on cerebral ischemic injury. NBP and NAD+ showed similar antioxidant effects, while NAD+ had better ability in restoring energy metabolism, possibly through upregulating the activity of SIRT1 and SIRT3. The protection provided by NBP against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion may be achieved through SIRT1.","['NAD+', 'NBP', 'SIRT1', 'SIRT3', 'acetylation', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'mitochondria']",2022-11-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056767,Gene signature and prediction model of the mitophagy-associated immune microenvironment in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable occurrence during kidney transplantation. Mitophagy, ferroptosis, and the associated immune microenvironment (IME) have been shown to play important roles in renal IRI. However, the role of mitophagy-associated IME genes in IRI remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to construct a prediction model of IRI prognosis based on mitophagy-associated IME genes.The specific biological characteristics of the mitophagy-associated IME gene signature were comprehensively analyzed using public databases such as GEO, Pathway Unification, and FerrDb. Correlations between the expression of prognostic genes and immune-related genes and IRI prognosis were determined by Cox regression, LASSO analysis, and Pearson's correlation. Molecular validation was performed using human kidney 2 (HK2) cells and culture supernatant as well as the serum and kidney tissues of mice after renal IRI. Gene expression was measured by PCR, and inflammatory cell infiltration was examined by ELISA and mass cytometry. Renal tissue damage was characterized using renal tissue homogenate and tissue sections.The expression of the mitophagy-associated IME gene signature was significantly correlated with IRI prognosis. Excessive mitophagy and extensive immune infiltration were the primary factors affecting IRI. In particular, FUNDC1, SQSTM1, UBB, UBC, KLF2, CDKN1A, and GDF15 were the key influencing factors. In addition, B cells, neutrophils, T cells, and M1 macrophages were the key immune cells present in the IME after IRI. A prediction model for IRI prognosis was constructed based on the key factors associated with the mitophagy IME. Validation experiments in cells and mice indicated that the prediction model was reliable and applicable.We clarified the relationship between the mitophagy-related IME and IRI. The IRI prognostic prediction model based on the mitophagy-associated IME gene signature provides novel insights on the prognosis and treatment of renal IRI.","['gene signature', 'immune microenvironment', 'mitophagy', 'prediction model', 'renal ischemia-reperfusion injury']",2022-12-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056478,A preclinical randomized controlled multi-centre trial of anti-interleukin-17A treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.,"Multiple consensus statements have called for preclinical randomized controlled trials to improve translation in stroke research. We investigated the efficacy of an interleukin-17A neutralizing antibody in a multi-centre preclinical randomized controlled trial using a murine ischaemia reperfusion stroke model. Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 45 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in four centres. Mice were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either an anti-interleukin-17A (500 µg) or isotype antibody (500 µg) intravenously 1 h after reperfusion. The primary endpoint was infarct volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging three days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Secondary analysis included mortality, neurological score, neutrophil infiltration and the impact of the gut microbiome on treatment effects. Out of 136 mice, 109 mice were included in the analysis of the primary endpoint. Mixed model analysis revealed that interleukin-17A neutralization significantly reduced infarct sizes (anti-interleukin-17A: 61.77 ± 31.04 mm3; IgG control: 75.66 ± 34.79 mm3; P = 0.01). Secondary outcome measures showed a decrease in mortality (hazard ratio = 3.43, 95% confidence interval = 1.157-10.18; P = 0.04) and neutrophil invasion into ischaemic cortices (anti-interleukin-17A: 7222 ± 6108 cells; IgG control: 28 153 ± 23 206 cells; P < 0.01). There was no difference in Bederson score. The analysis of the gut microbiome showed significant heterogeneity between centres (R = 0.78, P < 0.001, n = 40). Taken together, neutralization of interleukin-17A in a therapeutic time window resulted in a significant reduction of infarct sizes and mortality compared with isotype control. It suggests interleukin-17A neutralization as a potential therapeutic target in stroke.","['inflammation', 'interleukin-17A', 'preclinical randomized controlled trial', 'stroke']",2022-09-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056305,A retrospect and outlook on the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics in the era of endovascular therapy.,"Studies on the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics were carried out more than half a century ago. Subsequently, many cell and animal experiments attempted to verify the findings. However, in clinical trials, the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics were not observed. These contradictory results suggest a mismatch between basic research and clinical trials. The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable X (STAIR) proposed that the emergence of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) would provide a proper platform to verify the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics because the haemodynamics of patients undergoing EVT is very close to the ischaemia-reperfusion model in basic research. With the widespread use of EVT, it is necessary for us to re-examine the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics to guide the use of anesthetics during EVT because the choice of anesthesia is still based on team experience without definite guidelines. In this paper, we describe the research status of anesthesia in EVT and summarize the neuroprotective mechanisms of some anesthetics. Then, we focus on the contradictory results between clinical trials and basic research and discuss the causes. Finally, we provide an outlook on the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics in the era of endovascular therapy.","['anesthetics', 'endovascular procedures', 'ischaemic stroke', 'neuroprotection', 'therapy']",2023-01-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056146,"A new peptide, VD11, promotes structural and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.","The regenerative capacity of the central nervous system is very limited and few effective treatments are currently available for spinal cord injury. It is therefore a priority to develop new drugs that can promote structural and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Previous studies have shown that peptides can promote substantial repair and regeneration of injured tissue. While amphibians have a pronounced ability to regenerate the spinal cord, few studies have investigated the effect of amphibian spinal cord-derived peptides on spinal cord injury. Here we report for the first time the successful identification and isolation of a new polypeptide, VD11 (amino acid sequence: VDELWPPWLPC), from the spinal cord of an endemic Chinese amphibian (Odorrana schmackeri). In vitro experiments showed that VD11 promoted the secretion of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in BV2 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, as well as the proliferation and synaptic elongation of PC12 cells subjected to hypoxia. In vivo experiments showed that intravertebral injection of VD11 markedly promoted recovery of motor function in rats with spinal cord injury, alleviated pathological damage, and promoted axonal regeneration. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and western blotting showed that VD11 may affect spinal cord injury through activation of the AMPK and AKT signaling pathways. In summary, we discovered a novel amphibian-derived peptide that promotes structural and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.","['AMPK signaling pathway', 'Akt signaling pathway', 'amphibian-derived bioactive peptide', 'axonal regeneration', 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'motor function', 'nerve growth factor', 'neuroprotective effect', 'spinal cord injury']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056142,Reperfusion after hypoxia-ischemia exacerbates brain injury with compensatory activation of the anti- ferroptosis system: based on a novel rat model.,"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which predisposes to neonatal death and neurological sequelae, has a high morbidity, but there is still a lack of effective prevention and treatment in clinical practice. To better understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, in this study we compared hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury and simple hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats. First, based on the conventional Rice-Vannucci model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, we established a rat model of hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury by creating a common carotid artery muscle bridge. Then we performed tandem mass tag-based proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins between the hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury model and the conventional Rice-Vannucci model and found that the majority were mitochondrial proteins. We also performed transmission electron microscopy and found typical characteristics of ferroptosis, including mitochondrial shrinkage, ruptured mitochondrial membranes, and reduced or absent mitochondrial cristae. Further, both rat models showed high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and low levels of myelin basic protein, which are biological indicators of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and indicate similar degrees of damage. Finally, we found that ferroptosis-related Ferritin (Fth1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 were expressed at higher levels in the brain tissue of rats with hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury than in rats with simple hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Based on these results, it appears that the rat model of hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury is more closely related to the pathophysiology of clinical reperfusion. Reperfusion not only aggravates hypoxic-ischemic brain injury but also activates the anti-ferroptosis system.","['Rice-Vannucci', 'ferroptosis', 'hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy', 'hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury', 'mitochondria', 'model', 'proteomic analysis', 'reperfusion', 'transmission electron microscopy']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056141,Eph receptor A4 regulates motor neuron ferroptosis in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats.,"Previous studies have shown that the receptor tyrosine kinase Eph receptor A4 (EphA4) is abundantly expressed in the nervous system. The EphA4 signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating motor neuron ferroptosis in motor neuron disease. To investigate whether EphA4 signaling is involved in ferroptosis in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury, in this study we established a rat model of spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury by clamping the left carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. We found that spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury increased EphA4 expression in the neurons of anterior horn, markedly worsened ferroptosis-related indicators, substantially increased the number of mitochondria exhibiting features consistent with ferroptosis, promoted deterioration of motor nerve function, increased the permeability of the blood-spinal cord barrier, and increased the rate of motor neuron death. Inhibition of EphA4 largely rescued these effects. However, intrathecal administration of the ferroptosis inducer Erastin counteracted the beneficial effects conferred by treatment with the EphA4 inhibitor. Mass spectrometry and a PubMed search were performed to identify proteins that interact with EphA4, with the most notable being Beclin1 and Erk1/2. Our results showed that inhibition of EphA4 expression reduced binding to Beclin1, markedly reduced p-Beclin1, and reduced Beclin1-XCT complex formation. Inhibition of EphA4 also reduced binding to p-Erk1/2 and markedly decreased the expression of c-Myc, transferrin receptor 1, and p-Erk1/2. Additionally, we observed co-localization of EphA4 and p-Beclin1 and of EphA4 and p-ERK1/2 in neurons in the anterior horn. In conclusion, EphA4 participates in regulating ferroptosis of spinal motor neurons in the anterior horn in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting formation of the Beclin1-XCT complex and activating the Erk1/2/c-Myc/transferrin receptor 1 axis.","['Beclin1', 'EphA4', 'Erk1/2', 'c-Myc', 'ferroptosis', 'motor neuron', 'p-Erk1/2', 'rat', 'spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'transferrin receptor 1']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37056140,M2 macrophages mediate fibrotic scar formation in the early stages after cerebral ischemia in rats.,"In the central nervous system, the formation of fibrotic scar after injury inhibits axon regeneration and promotes repair. However, the mechanism underlying fibrotic scar formation and regulation remains poorly understood. M2 macrophages regulate fibrotic scar formation after injury to the heart, lung, kidney, and central nervous system. However, it remains to be clarified whether and how M2 macrophages regulate fibrotic scar formation after cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, we found that, in a rat model of cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion, fibrosis and macrophage infiltration were apparent in the ischemic core in the early stage of injury (within 14 days of injury). The number of infiltrated macrophages was positively correlated with fibronectin expression. Depletion of circulating monocyte-derived macrophages attenuated fibrotic scar formation. Interleukin 4 (IL4) expression was strongly enhanced in the ischemic cerebral tissues, and IL4-induced M2 macrophage polarization promoted fibrotic scar formation in the ischemic core. In addition, macrophage-conditioned medium directly promoted fibroblast proliferation and the production of extracellular matrix proteins in vitro. Further pharmacological and genetic analyses showed that sonic hedgehog secreted by M2 macrophages promoted fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and that this process was mediated by secretion of the key fibrosis-associated regulatory proteins transforming growth factor beta 1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Furthermore, IL4-afforded functional restoration on angiogenesis, cell apoptosis, and infarct volume in the ischemic core of cerebral ischemia rats were markedly impaired by treatment with an sonic hedgehog signaling inhibitor, paralleling the extent of fibrosis. Taken together, our findings show that IL4/sonic hedgehog/transforming growth factor beta 1 signaling targeting macrophages regulates the formation of fibrotic scar and is a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.","['Sonic hedgehog', 'central nervous system', 'extracellular matrix', 'fibronectin', 'fibrotic scar', 'interleukin 4', 'ischemic cerebral injury', 'macrophage', 'neurological function', 'transforming growth factor β1']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This observation emphasizes the need for novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the onset and progression of renal diseases. Recent advances in genomics have uncovered a previously unanticipated link between the non-coding genome and human kidney diseases. Here we screened and analysed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) previously identified in mouse kidneys by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, for conservation in humans and differential expression in renal tissue from healthy and diseased individuals. Our data suggest that LINC01187 is strongly down-regulated in human kidney tissues of patients with diabetic nephropathy and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, as well as in murine models of kidney diseases, including unilateral ureteral obstruction, nephrotoxic serum-induced glomerulonephritis and ischemia/reperfusion. Interestingly, LINC01187 overexpression in human kidney cells in vitro inhibits cell death indicating an anti-apoptotic function. Collectively, these data suggest a negative association of LINC01187 expression with renal diseases implying a potential protective role.","['\nGm12121\n', '\nLINC01187\n', 'apoptosis', 'in situ hybridization', 'long non-coding RNAs', 'renal diseases']",2021-06-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37055531,Targeted VEGFA therapy in regulating early acute kidney injury and late fibrosis.,"Damage to peritubular capillaries is a key process that contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI) progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) plays a critical role in maintaining the renal microvasculature. However, the physiological role of VEGFA in various AKI durations remains unclear. A severe unilateral ischemia‒reperfusion injury model was established to provide an overview of VEGFA expression and the peritubular microvascular density from acute to chronic injury in mouse kidneys. Therapeutic strategies involving early VEGFA supplementation protecting against acute injury and late anti-VEGFA treatment for fibrosis alleviation were analyzed. A proteomic analysis was conducted to determine the potential mechanism of renal fibrosis alleviation by anti-VEGFA. The results showed that two peaks of extraglomerular VEGFA expression were observed during AKI progression: one occurred at the early phase of AKI, and the other occurred during the transition to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Capillary rarefaction progressed despite the high expression of VEGFA at the CKD stage, and VEGFA was associated with interstitial fibrosis. Early VEGFA supplementation protected against renal injury by preserving microvessel structures and counteracting secondary tubular hypoxic insults, whereas late anti-VEGFA treatment attenuated renal fibrosis progression. The proteomic analysis highlighted an array of biological processes related to fibrosis alleviation by anti-VEGFA, which included regulation of supramolecular fiber organization, cell-matrix adhesion, fibroblast migration, and vasculogenesis. These findings establish the landscape of VEGFA expression and its dual roles during AKI progression, which provides the possibility for the orderly regulation of VEGFA to alleviate early acute injury and late fibrosis.","['fibrosis', 'kidney', 'vascular endothelial growth factor']",2022-08-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Here, we found a novel free radical scavenger termed as CZK, which is derived from alkaloids contained in Clausena lansium. In this study, we first compared cytotoxicity and biological activity between CZK and its parent's compound Claulansine F. It was found that CZK had lower cytotoxicity and improved anti-oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury than its parent's compound. Free radical scavenging test showed that CZK had a strong inhibitory effect on hydroxyl free radicals with the IC50 of 77.08 nM. Intravenous injection of CZK (50 mg/kg) significantly alleviated ischemia-reperfusion injury, manifested by reduced neuronal damage and decreased oxidative stress. Consistent with the findings, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased. Molecular docking predicted that CZK might be combined with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) complex. Our results also confirmed that CZK upregulated the contents of Nrf2 and its target gene products Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1).

37055036,Elevations in sweat sodium concentration following ischemia-reperfusion injury during passive heat stress.,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury results in damage to the renal tubules and causes impairments in sodium [Na+] reabsorption. Given the inability to conduct mechanistic renal I/R injury studies in vivo in humans, eccrine sweat glands have been proposed as a surrogate model given the anatomical and physiological similarities. We tested the hypothesis that sweat Na+ concentration is elevated following I/R injury during passive heat stress. We also tested the hypothesis that I/R injury during heat stress will impair cutaneous microvascular function. Fifteen young healthy adults completed ∼160 min of passive heat stress using a water-perfused suit (50°C). At 60 min of whole body heating, one upper arm was occluded for 20 min followed by a 20-min reperfusion. Sweat was collected from each forearm via an absorbent patch pre- and post-I/R. Following the 20-min reperfusion, cutaneous microvascular function was measured via local heating protocol. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated as red blood cell flux/mean arterial pressure and normalized to CVC during local heating to 44°C. Na+ concentration was log-transformed and data were reported as a mean change from pre-I/R (95% confidence interval). Changes in sweat sodium concentration from pre-I/R differed between arms post-I/R (experimental arm: +0.97 [+0.67 - 1.27] [LOG] Na+; control arm: +0.68 [+0.38 - 0.99] [LOG] Na+; P < 0.01). However, CVC during the local heating was not different between the experimental (80 ± 10%max) and control arms (78 ± 10%max; P = 0.59). In support of our hypothesis, Na+ concentration was elevated following I/R injury, but likely not accompanied by alterations in cutaneous microvascular function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the present study, we have demonstrated that sweat sodium concentration is elevated following ischemia-reperfusion injury during passive heat stress. This does not appear to be mediated by reductions in cutaneous microvascular function or active sweat glands, but may be related to alterations in local sweating responses during heat stress. This study demonstrates a potential use of eccrine sweat glands to understand sodium handling following ischemia-reperfusion injury, particularly given the challenges of in vivo studies of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans.","['ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'microvascular function', 'sweat', 'sweat electrolytes', 'sweat gland']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37054938,Kinsenoside alleviates oxidative stress-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction via promoting Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in ischemic stroke.,"An ischemic stroke usually causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and excessive oxidative stress (OS) levels. Kinsenoside (KD), a major effective compound extracted in Chinese herbal medicine Anoectochilus roxburghii (Orchidaceae), has anti-OS effects. The present study focused on exploring KD's protection against OS-mediated cerebral endothelial cell damage and BBB damage within the mouse model. Intracerebroventricular administration of KD upon reperfusion after 1 h ischemia decreased infarct volumes, neurological deficit, brain edema, neuronal loss, and apoptosis 72 h post-ischemic stroke. KD improved BBB structure and function, as evidenced by a lower 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose pass rate of the BBB and upregulation of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). KD protected bEnd.3 endothelial cells from oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in an in-vitro study. Meanwhile, OGD/R reduced transepithelial electronic resistance, whereas KD significantly increased TJ protein levels. Furthermore, based on in-vivo and in-vitro research, KD alleviated OS in endothelial cells, which is related to nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation as well as Nrf2/haem oxygenase 1 signaling protein stimulation. Our findings demonstrated that KD might serve as a potential compound for treating ischemic stroke involving antioxidant mechanisms.","['Blood-brain barrier', 'Endothelial cell', 'Ischemic stroke', 'KD', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-12-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37054936,Neutrophil membrane-coated taurine nanoparticles protect against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a multifactorial process caused by transient tissue hypoxia and the following reoxygenation, commonly occurring in liver transplantation and hepatectomy. Hepatic I/R can induce a systemic inflammatory response, liver dysfunction, or even multiple organ failure. Although we have previously reported that taurine could attenuate acute liver injury after hepatic I/R, only a tiny proportion of the systemically injected taurine could reach the targeted organ and tissues. In this present study, we prepared taurine nanoparticles (Nano-taurine) by coating taurine with neutrophil membranes and investigated the protective effects of Nano-taurine against I/R-induced injury and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that Nano-taurine restored liver function by declining AST and ALT levels and reducing histology damage. Nano-taurine decreased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) and oxidants including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was increased, while prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) was decreased upon administration of Nano-taurine, suggesting that inhibiting ferroptosis may be involved in the mechanism during hepatic I/R injury. These results suggest that Nano-taurine have a targeted therapeutic effect on hepatic I/R injury by inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and ferroptosis.","['Ferroptosis', 'Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Neutrophil membrane-coated nanoparticles', 'Taurine']",2022-11-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) is involved in the regulation of lysosomal lipid trafficking and calcium ion (Ca2+) signaling, and its genetic mutation causes a lysosomal storage disorder. Lipids and Ca2+ are key players in the complex orchestration of platelet activation.The present study aimed to determine the impact of NPC1 on Ca2+ mobilization during platelet activation in thrombo-occlusive diseases.Using MK/platelet-specific knockout mice of Npc1 (Npc1Pf4∆/Pf4∆), ex vivo and in vitro approaches as well as in vivo models of thrombosis, we investigated the effect of Npc1 on platelet function and thrombus formation.We showed that Npc1Pf4∆/Pf4∆ platelets display increased sphingosine levels and a locally impaired membrane-associated and SERCA3-dependent Ca2+ mobilisation compared to platelets from wildtype littermates (Npc1lox/lox). Further, we observed decreased platelet.Our findings highlight that NPC1 regulates membrane-associated and SERCA3-dependent Ca2+ mobilization during platelet activation and that MK/platelet-specific ablation of Npc1 protects against experimental models of arterial thrombosis and myocardial or cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.","['Niemann-Pick C1 protein', 'arterial thrombosis', 'calcium signaling', 'platelet activation', 'sphingolipids']",2023-01-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37054769,Acute administration of myeloid differentiation factor 2 inhibitor and N-acetyl cysteine attenuate brain damage in rats with cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Inflammation and oxidative stress are mechanisms which potentially underlie the brain damage that can occur after cardiac ischemic and reperfusion (I/R) injury. 2i-10 is a new anti-inflammatory agent, acting via direct inhibition of myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2). However, the effects of 2i-10 and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on pathologic brain in cardiac I/R injury are unknown. We hypothesized that 2i-10 and NAC offer similar neuroprotection levels against dendritic spine reduction through attenuation of brain inflammation, loss of tight junction integrity, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive gliosis, and suppression of AD protein expression in rats with cardiac I/R injury. Male rats were allocated to either sham or acute cardiac I/R group (30 min of cardiac ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion). Rats in cardiac I/R group were given one of following treatments intravenously at the onset of reperfusion: vehicle, 2i-10 (20 or 40 mg/kg), and NAC (75 or 150 mg/kg). The brain was then used to determine biochemical parameters. Cardiac I/R led to cardiac dysfunction with dendritic spine loss, loss of tight junction integrity, brain inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with 2i-10 (both doses) effectively reduced cardiac dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, brain inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, dendritic spine loss, and improved tight junction integrity. Although both doses of NAC effectively reduced brain mitochondrial dysfunction, treatment using a high dose of NAC reduced cardiac dysfunction, brain inflammation, and dendritic spine loss. In conclusion, treatment with 2i-10 and a high dose of NAC at the onset of reperfusion alleviated brain inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, consequently reducing dendritic spine loss in rats with cardiac I/R injury.","['Antioxidant', 'Antti-inflammation', 'Brain', 'Cardiac I/R injury', 'Mitochondria']",2022-10-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37054517,Discovery of ergosterol derivative from Aspergillus sp. TJ507 that protects against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury is a major cause of hypohepatia after surgical procedures such as hypovolemic shock, transplantation, and so on. In our continuous study of bioactive natural products from fungus, eight ergosterol-type sterides (1-8), including two undescribed compounds, sterolaspers A (1) and B (2), were isolated from Aspergillus sp. TJ507. Structure elucidation was accomplished by extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with the reported NMR data as well as X-Ray single crystal diffraction tests. Activity screen of these isolates showed 5α-stigmast-3,6-dione (3) possessing anti-hypoxia injury effects against CoCl2-induced hypoxia damage in hepatocytes. More importantly, compound 3 could improve liver function, alleviate liver damage, and restrain the hepatocellular apoptosis in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury murine model. As such, this ergosterol-type steride, 5α-stigmast-3,6-dione (3), might serve as lead structure for the development of novel hepatoprotective agents in the clinical treatment of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury.","['Anti-hypoxia injury activities', 'Aspergillus sp.', 'Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Sterides']",2022-11-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37053083,Primary graft dysfunction after lung transplantation.,"Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a clinical syndrome occurring within the first 72 h after lung transplantation and is characterized clinically by progressive hypoxemia and radiographically by patchy alveolar infiltrates. Resulting from ischemia-reperfusion injury, PGD represents a complex interplay between donor and recipient immunologic factors, as well as acute inflammation leading to alveolar cell damage. In the long term, chronic inflammation invoked by PGD can contribute to the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, an important cause of late mortality after lung transplant.Recent work has aimed to identify risk factors for PGD, focusing on donor, recipient and technical factors both inherent and potentially modifiable. Although no PGD-specific therapy currently exists, supportive care remains paramount and early initiation of ECMO can improve outcomes in select patients. Initial success with ex-vivo lung perfusion platforms has been observed with respect to decreasing PGD risk and increasing lung transplant volume; however, the impact on survival is not well delineated.This review will summarize the pathogenesis and clinical features of PGD, as well as highlight treatment strategies and emerging technologies to mitigate PGD risk in patients undergoing lung transplantation.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Given the similar mechanisms by which cardiac and skeletal muscle sustain an IR injury, we hypothesized that GIK would similarly protect skeletal muscle viability. A total of 20 C57BL/6 male mice (10 control, 10 GIK) sustained a hindlimb IR injury using a 2.5-hour rubber band tourniquet. Immediately prior to tourniquet placement, a subcutaneous osmotic pump was placed which infused control mice with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and treated mice with GIK (40% glucose, 50 U/l insulin, 80 mEq/L KCl, pH 4.5) at a rate of 16 µl/hr for 26.5 hours. At 24 hours following tourniquet removal, bilateral (tourniqueted and non-tourniqueted) gastrocnemius muscles were triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained to quantify percentage muscle viability. Bilateral peroneal muscles were used for gene expression analysis, serum creatinine and creatine kinase activity were measured, and a validated murine ethogram was used to quantify pain before euthanasia. GIK treatment resulted in a significant protection of skeletal muscle with increased viability (GIK 22.07% (SD 15.48%)) compared to saline control (control 3.14% (SD 3.29%)) (p = 0.005). Additionally, GIK led to a statistically significant reduction in gene expression markers of cell death (CASP3, p < 0.001) and inflammation (NOS2, p < 0.001; IGF1, p = 0.007; IL-1β, p = 0.002; TNFα, p = 0.012), and a significant reduction in serum creatine kinase (p = 0.004) and creatinine (p < 0.001). GIK led to a significant reduction in IR-related pain (p = 0.030). Systemic GIK infusion during and after limb ischaemia protects murine skeletal muscle from cell death, kidneys from reperfusion metabolites, and reduces pain by reducing post-ischaemic inflammation.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This study investigated the effect of recombinant adenovirus HIF-1ɑ on neurological function and energy metabolism in a rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model.Rats were divided into four groups: sham-operated (Sham) group, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR) group, recombinant adenovirus empty vector (Ad) group, and recombinant adenovirus-mediated HIF-1α (AdHIF-1α) group. The AdHIF-1α group and the Ad group were injected with AdHIF-1α and Ad in the lateral ventricle. The mNSS was performed at post-ischemia day 0 (P0) and P1, P14 and P28. At P14, the cerebral infarct volume was compared. At P28, HE staining, Nissl stains and TUNEL staining were performed. The expression of HIF-1α, GLUT1 and PFKFB3 were evaluated by Western Blot and immunohistochemistry. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the expression of GLUT1 and PFKFB3, and the level of energy metabolites: ATP, ADP and AMP.mNSS scores in the AdHIF-1α group were consistently lower than those in the CIR and Ad groups from P14 (P < 0.05) and Ad groups (P < 0.05). The cerebral infarct volume was reduced in the AdHIF-1α group compared with that in CIR group and Ad group (P < 0.05). At P28, HE showed better pathological changes in AdHIF-1α group. The number of Nissl bodies was increased in the AdHIF-1α group compared with the CIR and Ad groups (P < 0.05). The number of apoptotic cells in the AdHIF-1α group was fewer than that in the CIR and Ad groups (P < 0.05). The expression of HIF-1α, GLUT1 and PFKFB3 was significantly higher in the AdHIF-1α group compared with the CIR and Ad groups (P < 0.05). The ATP, ADP and AMP in the ischemic penumbra were also higher in the AdHIF-1α group (P < 0.05).HIF-lα promoted neurological function recovery and decreased cerebral infarct volume in rats after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by improving energy metabolism.","['6-biphosphatase 3', '6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2', 'GLUT1', 'HIF-lα', 'PFKFB3', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'energy metabolism', 'glucose transporter protein-1']",2022-09-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Given the proven treatment effect of intra-arterial thrombolysis in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO), we hypothesized that intra-arterial tenecteplase (TNK) could increase the recanalization rate of MeVO and thus improve clinical outcome.To explore the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial TNK in patients with MeVO.A maximum of 80 patients are required to test the superiority hypothesis, using power = 80% and α = 0.025 to conduct the one-sided test.Rescue treatment for mEdium veSsel oCclUsion by intra-artErial TNK (RESCUE-TNK) is a pilot, randomized, open-label, blinded end point, and multicenter trial. Eligible patients including primary MeVO as detected by the first DSA examination or secondary MeVO after endovascular treatment (EVT) for LVO will be assigned into the experimental group and control group as a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group will be treated with intra-arterial TNK (0.2-0.3 mg/min, for 20-30 min) via a microcatheter placed proximal to the site of occlusion, and the control group will be treated with routine therapy. Both groups of patients will be given standard stroke care based on the guidelines.The primary efficacy end point is successful recanalization of MeVO, defined as the expanded treatment in cerebral ischemia (eTICI) score 2b67-3 after the procedure, while the primary safety end point is symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), defined as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score increase ≥4 caused by intracranial hemorrhage within 24 (-6/+24) hours after randomization.The results of RESCUE-TNK will provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial TNK in the recanalization of patients with MeVO.","['design', 'medium vessel occlusion', 'rational', 'rescue thrombolysis', 'tenecteplase']",2023-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37051024,"Sigmar1 ablation leads to lung pathological changes associated with pulmonary fibrosis, inflammation, and altered surfactant proteins levels.","Sigma1 receptor protein (Sigmar1) is a small, multifunctional molecular chaperone protein ubiquitously expressed in almost all body tissues. This protein has previously shown its cardioprotective roles in rodent models of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Extensive literature also suggested its protective functions in several central nervous system disorders. Sigmar1's molecular functions in the pulmonary system remained unknown. Therefore, we aimed to determine the expression of Sigmar1 in the lungs. We also examined whether Sigmar1 ablation results in histological, ultrastructural, and biochemical changes associated with lung pathology over aging in mice. In the current study, we first confirmed the presence of Sigmar1 protein in human and mouse lungs using immunohistochemistry and immunostaining. We used the Sigmar1 global knockout mouse (Sigmar1-/-) to determine the pathophysiological role of Sigmar1 in lungs over aging. The histological staining of lung sections showed altered alveolar structures, higher immune cells infiltration, and upregulation of inflammatory markers (such as pNFκB) in Sigmar1-/- mice compared to wildtype (Wt) littermate control mice (Wt). This indicates higher pulmonary inflammation resulting from Sigmar1 deficiency in mice, which was associated with increased pulmonary fibrosis. The protein levels of some fibrotic markers, fibronectin, and pSMAD2 Ser 245/250/255 and Ser 465/467, were also elevated in mice lungs in the absence of Sigmar1 compared to Wt. The ultrastructural analysis of lungs in Wt mice showed numerous multilamellar bodies of different sizes with densely packed lipid lamellae and mitochondria with a dark matrix and dense cristae. In contrast, the Sigmar1-/- mice lung tissues showed altered multilamellar body structures in alveolar epithelial type-II pneumocytes with partial loss of lipid lamellae structures in the lamellar bodies. This was further associated with higher protein levels of all four surfactant proteins, SFTP-A, SFTP-B, SFTP-C, and SFTP-D, in the Sigmar1-/- mice lungs. This is the first study showing Sigmar1's expression pattern in human and mouse lungs and its association with lung pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that Sigmar1 deficiency leads to increased pulmonary inflammation, higher pulmonary fibrosis, alterations of the multilamellar body stuructures, and elevated levels of lung surfactant proteins.","['SIGMAR1', 'biological function', 'fibrosis', 'inflammation', 'lung', 'physiological function', 'surfactant protein']",2022-12-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37050899,Endothelial activation impairs the function of small extracellular vesicles.,"Small extracellular vesicles are nanosized vesicles (30-200 nm) that can ferry proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids between cells and therefore, have significant potential as biomarkers, drug delivery tools or therapeutic agents. SEVs of endothelial origin have been shown to -among other functions-reduce in vitro ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in cardiomyocytes, but whether a pro-inflammatory state of the endothelium impairs the functionality of these SEVs remains to be elucidated. To test this, human umbilical vein endothelial cells cells were treated with TNF-α 10 ng/mL and the expression of the pro-inflammatory parameters VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and eNOS were determined by Western blot. SEVs were isolated from endothelial cells treated with or without TNF-α 10 ng/mL using size exclusion chromatography. The size and concentration of SEVs was measured by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. The expression of the surface marker CD81 was determined by immunoassay, whereas their morphology was assessed by electron microscopy. The function of endothelial SEVs was assessed by evaluating their cardioprotective effect in an ex vivo model of global I/R using isolated hearts from adult C57BL/6 mice. Treatment of HUVECs with TNF-α induced the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, whereas eNOS levels were decreased. TNF-α did not affect the production, size, morphology, or expression of CD81. SEVs significantly reduced the infarct size as compared with untreated mice hearts, but SEVs isolated from TNF-α treated cells were unable to achieve this effect. Therefore, a pro-inflammatory state induced by TNF-α does not alter the production of endothelial SEVs but impairs their function in the setting of I/R injury.","['cardioprotection', 'endothelial activation', 'endothelial cells (ECs)', 'ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)', 'small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)']",2023-01-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37049959,Scutellarin Alleviates Ischemic Brain Injury in the Acute Phase by Affecting the Activity of Neurotransmitters in Neurons.,"Cerebral ischemic stroke is a common neuron loss disease that is caused by the interruption of the blood supply to the brain. In order to enhance the CIS outcome, both identifying the treatment target of ischemic brain damage in the acute phase and developing effective therapies are urgently needed. Scutellarin had been found to be beneficial to ischemic injuries and has been shown to have potent effects in clinical application on both stroke and myocardial infarction. However, whether scutellarin improves ischemic brain damage in the acute phase remains unknown. In this study, the protective effects of scutellarin on ischemic brain damage in the acute phase (within 12 h) were illustrated. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) modeling rats, the Z-Longa score was significantly down-regulated by 25% and 23.1%, and the brain infarct size was reduced by 26.95 ± 0.03% and 25.63 ± 0.02% when responding to high-dose and low-dose scutellarin treatments, respectively. H&E and TUNEL staining results indicated that the neuron loss of the ischemic region was improved under scutellarin treatment. In order to investigate the mechanism of scutellarin's effects on ischemic brain damage in the acute phase, changes in proteins and metabolites were analyzed. The suppression of scutellarin on the glutamate-inducing excitatory amino acid toxicity was strongly indicated in the study of both proteomics and metabolomics. A molecular docking experiment presented strong interactions between scutellarin and glutamate receptors, which score much higher than those of memantine. Further, by performing a parallel reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (PRM-MS) study on both the cortex and hippocampus tissue of the ischemic region, we screened the scutellarin-regulating molecules that are involved in both the release and transportation of neurotransmitters. It was found that the aberrant levels of glutamate receptors, including EAAT2, GRIN1, GRIN2B, and GRM1, as well as of other glutamatergic pathway-involving proteins, including CAMKK2, PSD95, and nNOS, were significantly regulated in the ischemic cortex. In the hippocampus, EAAT2, GRIN1, nNOS, and CAM were significantly regulated. Taken together, scutellarin exerts potent effects on ischemic brain damage in the acute phase by regulating the activity of neurotransmitters and reducing the toxicity of excitatory amino acids in in neurons.","['acute phase', 'cerebral ischemic stroke', 'mechanism', 'neurotransmitter', 'scutellarin']",2023-02-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37049936,Peptide Sodium Channels Modulator Mu-Agatoxin-Aa1a Prevents Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury of Cells.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an irreversible functional and structural injury. Restoration of normal oxygen concentration exacerbates the emergence and development of deadly cells. One of the possible moments of reperfusion damage to cells is an increase in the intracellular concentration of sodium ions. In this article, we study the mu-agatoxin-Aa1a, a modulator of sodium channels, on the processes of IRI cells damage. The toxin was synthesized using an automatic peptide synthesizer. Hypoxia was induced by reducing the content of serum and oxygen in the CHO-K1 culture. The influence of the toxin on the level of apoptosis; intracellular concentration of sodium, calcium, and potassium ions; intracellular pH; totality of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and ATP; and changes in the mitochondrial potential were studied. The experiments performed show that mu-agatoxin-Aa1a effectively prevents IRI of cells. Toxin reduces the level of apoptosis and prevents a decrease in the intracellular concentration of sodium and calcium ions during IRI. Mu-agatoxin-Aa1a contributes to the maintenance of elevated intracellular pH, reduces the intracellular concentration of ROS, and prevents the decrease in intracellular NO concentration and mitochondrial potential under conditions of reoxygenation/reperfusion. An analysis of experimental data shows that the mu-agatoxin-Aa1a peptide has adaptogenic properties.

37047745,Integrative Analysis of Single-Cell and Bulk Sequencing Data Depicting the Expression and Function of P2ry12 in Microglia Post Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"P2ry12 is a microglial marker gene. Recently, increasing evidence has demonstrated that its expression levels can vary in response to different CNS disorders and can affect microglial functions, such as polarization, plasticity, and migration. However, the expression and function of P2ry12 in microglia during ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remain unclear. Here, we developed a computational method to obtain microglia-specific P2ry12 genes (MSPGs) using sequencing data associated with IRI. We evaluated the change in comprehensive expression levels of MSPGs during IRI and compared it to the expression of P2ry12 to determine similarity. Subsequently, the MSPGs were used to explore the P2ry12 functions in microglia through bioinformatics. Moreover, several animal experiments were also conducted to confirm the reliability of the results. The expression of P2ry12 was observed to decrease gradually within 24 h post injury. In response, microglia with reduced P2ry12 expression showed an increase in the expression of one receptor-encoding gene (Flt1) and three ligand-encoding genes (Nampt, Igf1, and Cxcl2). Furthermore, double-labeling immunofluorescence staining revealed that inhibition of P2ry12 blocked microglial migration towards vessels during IRI. Overall, we employ a combined computational and experimental approach to successfully explore P2ry12 expression and function in microglia during IRI.","['P2ry12', 'bioinformatics', 'ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'microglia']",2023-02-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Despite significant advances in the understanding of what causes I-R injury and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R) stress, viable molecular strategies that could be targeted for the treatment of the deleterious biochemical pathways activated during I-R remain elusive. The master hypoxamiR, microRNA-210 (miR-210), is a major determinant of protective cellular adaptation to hypoxia stress but exacerbates apoptotic cell death during cellular reoxygenation. While the hypoxia-induced transcriptional up-regulation of miR-210 is well delineated, the cellular mechanisms and molecular entities that regulate the transcriptional induction of miR-210 during the cellular reoxygenation phase have not been elucidated yet. Herein, in immortalized AC-16 cardiomyocytes, we delineated the indispensable role of the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor, NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) in H-R-induced miR-210 expression during cellular reoxygenation. Using dominant negative and dominant active expression vectors encoding kinases to competitively inhibit NF-κB activation, we elucidated NF-κB activation as a significant mediator of H-R-induced miR-210 expression. Ensuing molecular assays revealed a direct NF-κB-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of miR-210 expression in response to the H-R challenge that is characterized by the NF-κB-mediated reorchestration of the entire repertoire of histone modification changes that are a signatory of a permissive actively transcribed miR-210 promoter. Our study confers a novel insight identifying NF-κB as a potential novel molecular target to combat H-R-elicited miR-210 expression that fosters augmented cardiomyocyte cell death.","['AC-16 cardiomyocytes', 'NF-κB', 'RNA polymerase II', 'histone modification', 'hypoxia–reoxygenation', 'miR-210']",2023-03-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37047496,Myokine Musclin Is Critical for Exercise-Induced Cardiac Conditioning.,"This study investigates the role and mechanisms by which the myokine musclin promotes exercise-induced cardiac conditioning. Exercise is one of the most powerful triggers of cardiac conditioning with proven benefits for healthy and diseased hearts. There is an emerging understanding that muscles produce and secrete myokines, which mediate local and systemic ""crosstalk"" to promote exercise tolerance and overall health, including cardiac conditioning. The myokine musclin, highly conserved across animal species, has been shown to be upregulated in response to physical activity. However, musclin effects on exercise-induced cardiac conditioning are not established. Following completion of a treadmill exercise protocol, wild type (WT) mice and mice with disruption of the musclin-encoding gene, Ostn, had their hearts extracted and exposed to an ex vivo ischemia-reperfusion protocol or biochemical studies. Disruption of musclin signaling abolished the ability of exercise to mitigate cardiac ischemic injury. This impaired cardioprotection was associated with reduced mitochondrial content and function linked to blunted cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling. Genetic deletion of musclin reduced the nuclear abundance of protein kinase G (PKGI) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding (CREB), resulting in suppression of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α), and its downstream targets in response to physical activity. Synthetic musclin peptide pharmacokinetic parameters were defined and used to calculate the infusion rate necessary to maintain its plasma level comparable to that observed after exercise. This infusion was found to reproduce the cardioprotective benefits of exercise in sedentary WT and Ostn-KO mice. Musclin is essential for exercise-induced cardiac protection. Boosting musclin signaling might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for cardioprotection.","['cardioprotection', 'exercise', 'heart disease', 'ischemia', 'musclin', 'natriuretic peptide', 'osteocrin', 'pharmacokinetics', 'preconditioning', 'reperfusion', 'stress resistance']",2023-02-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cardiomyocytes (CMs), fibroblasts (FBs), endothelial cells (ECs), and immune cells are the primary cell types involved in heart disorders, and, thus, targeting a specific cell type for the treatment of heart disease may be more effective. The same interleukin may have various effects on different kinds of cell types in heart disease, yet the exact role of interleukins and their pathophysiological pathways on primary cell types remain largely unexplored. This review will focus on the pathophysiological effects of various interleukins including the IL-1 family (IL-1, IL-18, IL-33, IL-37), IL-2, IL-4, the IL-6 family (IL-6 and IL-11), IL-8, IL-10, IL-17 on primary cell types in common heart disease, which may contribute to the more precise and effective treatment of heart disease.","['cardiomyocytes', 'fibroblasts', 'heart disease', 'immune cells', 'interleukin']",2023-02-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37047436,Importance of Mitochondria in Cardiac Pathologies: Focus on Uncoupling Proteins and Monoamine Oxidases.,"On the one hand, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the onset and progression of a wide array of diseases. On the other hand, these are a part of signaling pathways related to cell metabolism, growth and survival. While ROS are produced at various cellular sites, in cardiomyocytes the largest amount of ROS is generated by mitochondria. Apart from the electron transport chain and various other proteins, uncoupling protein (UCP) and monoamine oxidases (MAO) have been proposed to modify mitochondrial ROS formation. Here, we review the recent information on UCP and MAO in cardiac injuries induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) as well as protection from I/R and heart failure secondary to I/R injury or pressure overload. The current data in the literature suggest that I/R will preferentially upregulate UCP2 in cardiac tissue but not UCP3. Studies addressing the consequences of such induction are currently inconclusive because the precise function of UCP2 in cardiac tissue is not well understood, and tissue- and species-specific aspects complicate the situation. In general, UCP2 may reduce oxidative stress by mild uncoupling and both UCP2 and UCP3 affect substrate utilization in cardiac tissue, thereby modifying post-ischemic remodeling. MAOs are important for the physiological regulation of substrate concentrations. Upon increased expression and or activity of MAOs, however, the increased production of ROS and reactive aldehydes contribute to cardiac alterations such as hypertrophy, inflammation, irreversible cardiomyocyte injury, and failure.","['heart failure', 'ischemia', 'pulmonary hypertension', 'reactive oxygen species', 'reperfusion']",2023-02-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37047416,Sex Difference in Cardioprotection against Acute Myocardial Infarction in MAO-B Knockout Mice In Vivo.,"The cardiomyocyte-specific knockout (KO) of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B, an enzyme involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vitro. Because sex hormones have a strong impact on MAO metabolic pathways, we analyzed the myocardial infarct size (IS) following I/R in female and male MAO-B KO mice in vivo.To induce the deletion of MAO-B, MAO-B KO mice (Myh6 Cre+/MAO-Bfl/fl) and wild-type (WT, Cre-negative MAO-Bfl/fl littermates) were fed with tamoxifen for 2 weeks followed by 10 weeks of normal mice chow. Myocardial infarction (assessed by TTC staining and expressed as a percentage of the area at risk as determined by Evans blue staining)) was induced by 45 min coronary occlusion followed by 120 min of reperfusion.The mortality following I/R was higher in male compared to female mice, with the lowest mortality found in MAO-B KO female mice. IS was significantly higher in male WT mice compared to female WT mice. MAO-B KO reduced IS in male mice but had no further impact on IS in female MAO-B KO mice. Interestingly, there was no difference in the plasma estradiol levels among the groups.The cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of MAO-B protects male mice against acute myocardial infarction but had no effect on the infarct size in female mice.","['ischemia/reperfusion', 'mitochondria', 'monoamine oxidase B']",2023-02-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37047321,Myeloid Trem2 Dynamically Regulates the Induction and Resolution of Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Inflammation.,"Trem2, a transmembrane protein that is simultaneously expressed in both bone marrow-derived and embryonic-derived liver-resident macrophages, plays a complex role in liver inflammation. The unique role of myeloid Trem2 in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is not precisely understood. Our study showed that in the early stage of inflammation induction after IR, Deletion of myeloid Trem2 inhibited the induction of iNOS, MCP-1, and CXCL1/2, alleviated the accumulation of neutrophils and mitochondrial damage, and simultaneously decreased ROS formation. However, when inflammatory monocyte-macrophages gradually evolved into CD11bhiLy6Clow pro-resolution macrophages through a phenotypic switch, the story of Trem2 took a turn. Myeloid Trem2 in pro-resolution macrophages promotes phagocytosis of IR-accumulated apoptotic cells by controlling Rac1-related actin polymerization, thereby actively promoting the resolution of inflammation. This effect may be exercised to regulate the Cox2/PGE2 axis by Trem2, alone or synergistically with MerTK/Arg1. Importantly, when myeloid Trem2 was over-expressed, the phenotypic transition of monocytes from a pro-inflammatory to a resolution type was accelerated, whereas knockdown of myeloid Trem2 resulted in delayed upregulation of CX3CR1. Collectively, our findings suggest that myeloid Trem2 is involved in the cascade of IR inflammation in a two-sided capacity, with complex and heterogeneous roles at different stages, not only contributing to our understanding of sterile inflammatory immunity but also to better explore the regulatory strategies and intrinsic requirements of targeting Trem2 in the event of sterile liver injury.","['Cox2', 'PGE2', 'Trem2', 'efferocytosis', 'liver ischemia reperfusion']",2023-02-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37047160,"1,3,8-Triazaspiro[4.5]decane Derivatives Inhibit Permeability Transition Pores through a FO-ATP Synthase c Subunit Glu119-Independent Mechanism That Prevents Oligomycin A-Related Side Effects.","Permeability transition pore (PTP) molecular composition and activity modulation have been a matter of research for several years, especially due to their importance in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). Notably, c subunit of ATP synthase (Csub) has been identified as one of the PTP-forming proteins and as a target for cardioprotection. Oligomycin A is a well-known Csub interactor that has been chemically modified in-depth for proposed new pharmacological approaches against cardiac reperfusion injury. Indeed, by taking advantage of its scaffold and through focused chemical improvements, innovative Csub-dependent PTP inhibitors (1,3,8-Triazaspiro[4.5]decane) have been synthetized in the past. Interestingly, four critical amino acids have been found to be involved in Oligomycin A-Csub binding in yeast. However, their position on the human sequence is unknown, as is their function in PTP inhibition. The aims of this study are to (i) identify for the first time the topologically equivalent residues in the human Csub sequence; (ii) provide their in vitro validation in Oligomycin A-mediated PTP inhibition and (iii) understand their relevance in the binding of 1,3,8-Triazaspiro[4.5]decane small molecules, as Oligomycin A derivatives, in order to provide insights into Csub interactions. Notably, in this study we demonstrated that 1,3,8-Triazaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives inhibit permeability transition pores through a FO-ATP synthase c subunit Glu119-independent mechanism that prevents Oligomycin A-related side effects.","['Oligomycin A', 'c subunit of FO-ATP synthase', 'cardioprotection', 'permeability transition pore', 'small molecules']",2023-02-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

We investigated the cardioprotective effects of MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BMX-001), a superoxide dismutase mimic, in an in vitro model of I/R injury in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. We found that BMX-001 protected against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced oxidative stress, as evident by a significant reduction in intracellular and mitochondrial superoxide levels. BMX-001 pre-treatment also reduced H/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, as marked by a reduction in TUNEL-positive cells. We further demonstrated that BMX-001 pre-treatment significantly improved mitochondrial function, particularly O2 consumption, in mouse adult cardiomyocytes subjected to H/R. BMX-001 treatment also attenuated cardiolipin peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) level, and 4-HNE adducted proteins following H/R injury. Finally, the pre-treatment with BMX-001 improved cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in H9c2 cells following H/R injury. Our findings suggest that BMX-001 has therapeutic potential as a cardioprotective agent against oxidative stress-induced H/R damage in H9c2 cardiomyocytes.","['SOD2', 'apoptosis', 'cardiomyocytes', 'superoxide']",2023-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37047079,Platelets and Cardioprotection: The Role of Nitric Oxide and Carbon Oxide.,"Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) represent a pair of biologically active gases with an increasingly well-defined range of effects on circulating platelets. These gases interact with platelets and cells in the vessels and heart and exert fundamentally similar biological effects, albeit through different mechanisms and with some peculiarity. Within the cardiovascular system, for example, the gases are predominantly vasodilators and exert antiaggregatory effects, and are protective against damage in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Indeed, NO is an important vasodilator acting on vascular smooth muscle and is able to inhibit platelet activation. NO reacts with superoxide anion (O2(-•)) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), a nitrosating agent capable of inducing oxidative/nitrative signaling and stress both at cardiovascular, platelet, and plasma levels. CO reduces platelet reactivity, therefore it is an anticoagulant, but it also has some cardioprotective and procoagulant properties. This review article summarizes current knowledge on the platelets and roles of gas mediators (NO, and CO) in cardioprotection. In particular, we aim to examine the link and interactions between platelets, NO, and CO and cardioprotective pathways.","['gasotransmitters', 'nitrosating agents', 'platelets', 'preconditioning', 'remote conditioning']",2023-02-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37046136,Phosphoenolpyruvate induces endothelial dysfunction and cell senescence through stimulation of metabolic reprogramming.,"Endothelial dysfunction is a key early link in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the accumulation of senescent vascular endothelial cells causes endothelial dysfunction. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which is a high-energy glycolytic intermediate, protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury in isolated rat lung, heart, and liver tissue by quickly providing ATP. However, it was reported that serum PEP concentrations are 13-fold higher in healthy elderly compare to the young. Unlike that of other cell types, the energy required for the physiological function of endothelial cells is mainly derived from glycolysis. Recently, it is unclear whether circulating accumulation of PEP affects endothelial cell function. In this study, we found for the first time that 50-250 μM of PEP significantly promoted THP-1 monocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) through increased expression of vascular endothelial adhesion factor 1 (VCAM1) and intercellular adhesion factor 1 (ICAM1) in HUVECs. Meanwhile, 50-250 μM of PEP decreased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and cellular level of nitric oxide (NO) in HUVECs. Moreover, PEP increased levels of ROS, enhanced the numbers of SA-β-Gal-positive cells and upregulated the expression of cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, p16 and the phosphorylation level of p53 on Ser15, and the expression of proinflammatory factors including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18 and MCP-1 in HUVECs. Furthermore, PEP increased both oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycolysis rate, and was accompanied by reduced NAD+/NADH ratios and enhanced phosphorylation levels of AMPKα (Thr172), p38 MAPK (T180/Y182) and NF-κB p65 (Ser536) in HUVECs. Notably, PEP had no significant effect on hepG2 cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that PEP induced dysfunction and senescence in vascular endothelial cells through stimulation of metabolic reprogramming.","['Cell senescence', 'Endothelial dysfunction', 'Metabolic reprogramming', 'Phosphoenolpyruvate']",2022-10-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37045900,Therapeutic effects of polydeoxyribonucleotide in an in vitro neuronal model of ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) is an agonist that selectively stimulates adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2A), which suppresses inflammatory responses. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke by inducing neuroinflammation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of PDRN in an in vitro I/R injury model. The in vitro model was established with differentiated Neuro-2a cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation condition. The cells were treated with PDRN for 24 h under reoxygenation condition. As the results of RNA-seq transcriptome analysis, CSF1, IL-6, PTPN6, RAC2, and STAT1 were identified of its relation to the effect of PDRN on inflammatory responses in the model. To further investigate therapeutic effects of PDRN, RT-qPCR, western blotting, LDH assay, and TUNEL assay were performed. PDRN significantly reversed the expression of genes and proteins related to inflammatory responses. The elevated ADORA2A expression by PDRN treatment downregulated JAK/STAT pathway in the model. Furthermore, PDRN inhibited neuronal cell death in the model. Consequently, our results suggested that PDRN alleviated inflammatory responses through inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway by mediating ADORA2A expression and inhibited neuronal cell death in the model. These results provide significant insights into potential therapeutic approaches involving PDRN treatment for I/R injury.",[],2022-10-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37044034,Hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles miR-122-5p promotes hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury by regulating Kupffer cell polarization.,"Ischemia reperfusion injury remains a major barrier to liver transplantation, especially using grafts from donation after circulatory death, and it is also a pressing issue to be solved in clinical practice. Kupffer cell polarization toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype is an early trigger of liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the molecular mechanism regulating Kupffer cell polarization has not yet been fully elucidated. We induced liver ischemia reperfusion injury in mice and obtained samples from patients undergoing liver transplantation, serum and hepatocytes-derived extracellular vesicles were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. Kupffer cell polarization was examined by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence histochemistry. RNA-seq was conducted to detect the differentially expressed miRNAs in extracellular vesicles. The role and mechanism of exosomal miR-122-5p in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury were determined both in vitro and in vivo. We identified ischemia reperfusion induced extracellular vesicles as a major cause of hepatic inflammation and tissue damage using adoptive transfer and release inhibition. The study also demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived exosomal miR-122-5p mediates liver ischemia reperfusion injury by polarizing Kupffer cell via PPARδ down-regulation and NF-κB pathway activation using profiling and functional analysis. Moreover, inhibiting miR-122-5p with antagomir suppressed Kupffer cell M1 polarization and attenuated liver ischemia reperfusion injury. Overall, our study demonstrated that hepatocyte-derived exosomal miR-122-5p played a critical role in promoting hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury through modulating PPARδ signaling and NF-κB pathway to introduce M1 polarization of Kupffer cell. Inhibition of miR-122-5p exhibited a protective effect against liver ischemia reperfusion injury, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for liver transplantation.","['Extracellular vesicles', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Macrophage polarization', 'NF-κB', 'PPARδ', 'miRNA']",2022-12-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37042626,Loss of renal tubular G9a benefits acute kidney injury by lowering focal lipid accumulation via CES1.,"Surgery-induced renal ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury and nephrotoxic drugs like cisplatin can cause acute kidney injury (AKI), for which there is no effective therapy. Lipid accumulation is evident following AKI in renal tubules although the mechanisms and pathological effects are unclear. Here, we report that Ehmt2-encoded histone methyltransferase G9a is upregulated in patients and mouse kidneys after AKI. Renal tubular specific knockout of G9a (Ehmt2Ksp ) or pharmacological inhibition of G9a alleviates lipid accumulation associated with AKI. Mechanistically, G9a suppresses transcription of the lipolytic enzyme Ces1; moreover, G9a and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) competitively bind to the same promoter regions of Ces1. Ces1 is consistently observed to be downregulated in the kidney of AKI patients. Pharmacological inhibition of Ces1 increases lipid accumulation, exacerbates renal I/R-injury and eliminates the beneficial effects on AKI observed in Ehmt2Ksp mice. Furthermore, lipid-lowering atorvastatin and an FXR agonist alleviate AKI by activating Ces1 and reducing renal lipid accumulation. Together, our results reveal a G9a/FXR-Ces1 axis that affects the AKI outcome via regulating renal lipid accumulation.","['Ces1', 'FXR', 'G9a', 'acute kidney injury', 'lipid toxicity']",2022-09-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37042484,Higher mean cerebral oxygen saturation shortly after extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients who regain consciousness.,"In cardiac arrest, cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury mainly determine the neurological outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between the course of cerebral oxygenation and regain of consciousness in patients treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). We hypothesized that rapid cerebral oxygenation increase causes unfavorable outcomes.This prospective observational study was conducted in three European hospitals. We included adult ECPR patients between October 2018 and March 2020, in whom cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) measurements were started minutes before ECPR initiation until 3 h after. The primary outcome was regain of consciousness, defined as following commands, analyzed using binary logistic regression.The sample consisted of 26 ECPR patients (23% women, Agemean 46 years). We found no significant differences in rSO2 values at baseline (49.1% versus 49.3% for regain versus no regain of consciousness). Mean cerebral rSO2 values in the first 30 min after ECPR initiation were higher in patients who regained consciousness (38%) than in patients who did not regain consciousness (62%, odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.50).Higher mean cerebral rSO2 values in the first 30 min after initiation of ECPR were found in patients who regained consciousness.","['ECPR', 'cardiac arrest', 'cerebral regional oxygen saturation', 'extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'heart arrest', 'near-infrared spectroscopy']",2022-02-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, gadolinium-based contrast agents are contraindicated in patients with acute and chronic renal insufficiency. In addition, several recent studies have noted tissue deposition of free gadolinium in patients who have undergone serial contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. There is a clinical need for alternative forms of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents that are acceptable in the setting of renal insufficiency. Methods and Results Three days after 80 minutes of ischemia/reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed to assess myocardial lesion burden using both contrast agents. Late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was examined 10 and 15 minutes after contrast injection. Contrast agents were administered in alternating manner with a 2- to 3-hour washout period between contrast agent injections. Lesion evaluation and image processing were performed using Segment Medviso software. Mean infarct size and transmurality, measured using RVP-001, were not different compared with those measured using late gadolinium enhancement images. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a nominal bias of 0.13 mL (<1% of average total lesion volume) for RVP-001 in terms of gross infarct size measurement. Conclusions The experimental manganese-based contrast agent RVP-001 appears to be an effective agent for assessment of myocardial infarction location, size, and transmurality, and it may be useful as an alternative to gadolinium-based agents.","['contrast agent', 'gadolinium', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'manganese', 'myocardial infarction']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37042253,Cardioprotective Effect of Empagliflozin and Circulating Ketone Bodies During Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"SGLT2i (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors) improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure, but the mechanisms of action are not completely understood. SGLT2i increases circulating levels of ketone bodies, which has been demonstrated to enhance myocardial energetics and induce reverse ventricular remodeling. However, the role of SGLT2i or ketone bodies on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury remains in the dark. The objective of this study is to investigate the cardioprotective potential of empagliflozin and ketone bodies during acute myocardial infarction (MI).We used a nondiabetic porcine model of ischemia reperfusion using a percutaneous occlusion of proximal left anterior descending artery for 45 minutes. Animals received 1-week pretreatment with either empagliflozin or placebo prior to MI induction. Additionally, a third group received intravenous infusion of the ketone body BOHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate) during the MI induction. Acute effects of the treatments were assessed 4-hour post-MI by cardiac magnetic resonance and histology (thioflavin for area at risk, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining for MI size). All animals were euthanized immediately postcardiac magnetic resonance, and heart samples were collected.The area at risk was similar in all groups. Empagliflozin treatment increased BOHB levels. Empagliflozin-treated animals showed significantly higher myocardial salvage, smaller MI size (both by cardiac magnetic resonance and histology), less microvascular obstruction, and improved cardiac function (left ventricle ejection fraction and strain). Furthermore, empagliflozin-treated animals demonstrated reduced biomarkers of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and oxidative stress compared with placebo. The BOHB group showed similar results to the empagliflozin group.One-week pretreatment with empagliflozin ameliorates ischemia reperfusion injury, reduces MI size and microvascular obstruction, increases myocardial salvage, preserves left ventricle systolic function, and lowers apoptosis and oxidative stress. Periprocedural intravenous infusion of BOHB during myocardial ischemia also induces cardioprotection, suggesting a role for BOHB availability as an additional mechanism within the wide spectrum of actions of SGLT2i.","['empagliflozin', 'glucose', 'ketone bodies', 'myocardial infarction', 'reperfusion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37042039,Edaravone promotes viability of random skin flaps via activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway-mediated enhancement of autophagy.,"Random skin flap transplantation is a commonly used technique. However, ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury always impair its therapeutic effectiveness through acclerating oxidative stress, apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis. To survive, cells rely on mediating autophagy, DNA repair, immunoregulation to resist these cellular injuries. Thus, mediating autophagy may affect the survival of random skin flaps. The edaravone (EDA), a oxygen radicals scavenger, also possesses autophagy mediator potential, we investigated the effects of EDA on skin flap survival and its autophagy-related mechanisms. In vivo, mice were administered EDA or saline intraperitoneally for 7 days postoperatively. We found that EDA ameliorated the viability of random skin flaps, promoted autophagy and angiogenesis, attenuated apoptosis and oxidative stress. In vitro, mouse umbilical vascular endothelial cells (MUVECs) were administered EDA or 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) or rapacymin (Rapa, an autophagy activator) at the beginning of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that EDA promoted cell viability, activated autophagy, enhanced angiogenesis, alleviated apoptosis and oxidative stress. On one hand, 3-MA reversed the effects of EDA on cell viability, oxidative stress and apoptosis via inhibiting autophagy. On the other hand, Rapa had the similar effects of EDA. Furthermore, EDA-induced autophagy was mediated through downregulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. The findings showed that EDA ameliorated viability of random skin flaps by promoting angiogenesis, suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis, which may be mediated by autophagic activation through downregulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway.","['angiogenesis', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'edaravone', 'oxidative stress', 'random skin flaps']",2023-01-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37041639,Antibiotic use in acute mesenteric ischemia: a review of the evidence and call to action.,"Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate. The standard practice after making the diagnosis includes aggressive resuscitation, anticoagulation, followed by revascularization and resection of necrotic bowel. The role of empiric antibiotics in the management of AMI is not well defined in the literature. This review article aims to examine our current understanding on this matter, based on bench research and clinical studies. It is demonstrated in animal study model that the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury damages intestinal epithelium, and subsequently lead to barrier dysfunction, a condition that can support bacterial translocation through a complex interplay between the intestinal epithelium, the intestinal immune system and the intestine's endogenous bacterial population. Based on this mechanism, it is possible that the use of antibiotics may help mitigate the consequences of I/R injury, which is examined in few animal studies. In clinical practice, many guidelines support the use of prophylactic antibiotics, based on a meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) demonstrating the benefit of antibiotics in multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. However, there is no direct reference to AMI in this meta-analysis. Most clinical studies that focus on AMI and mentions the use of antibiotics are retrospective and single institution, and very few comments on the role of antibiotics in their discussions. We conclude that there is limited evidence in literature to support the use of prophylactic antibiotic in AMI to improve outcome. More clinical studies with high level of evidence and basic science research are needed to improve our understanding on this topic and ultimately help build a better clinical pathway for patients with AMI.","['Antibiotics', 'Epithelial barrier', 'Mesenteric ischemia', 'Sepsis', 'Thromboembolism']",2022-12-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37039410,Pediatric Ischemic Stroke.,"Pediatric cerebrovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death and disability in children. Survivors of childhood stroke and their families are often left to cope with long-lasting sequelae, such as barriers to school reentry and long-term challenges in attaining independence as adults. Because childhood stroke is rare and providers may not be familiar with the disorder, this article reviews the risk factors, acute management, and sequelae of ischemic stroke in children.High-quality evidence has resulted in an organized approach to emergent treatment of ischemic stroke in adults, but most front-line providers are less prepared for emergent stroke management in children. The level of evidence for reperfusion therapies in children remains low but is growing. Thrombolysis and thrombectomy are sometimes considered for hyperacute treatment of stroke in children. Readiness for pediatric stroke at regional centers should include an organized approach to pediatric stroke triage and management based on extrapolation from adult stroke trials, expert consensus, and emerging pediatric studies.This review provides up-to-date information about ischemic stroke risk factors and management in children.

37037094,The role of mitochondrial dynamics in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide. More than 80 % of strokes are ischemic, caused by an occlusion of cerebral arteries. Without question, restoration of blood supply as soon as possible is the first therapeutic strategy. Nonetheless paradoxically, reperfusion can further aggravate the injury through a series of reactions known as cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Mitochondria play a vital role in promoting nerve survival and neurological function recovery and mitochondrial dysfunction is considered one of the characteristics of CIRI. Neurons often die due to oxidative stress and an imbalance in energy metabolism following CIRI, and there is a strong association with mitochondrial dysfunction. Altered mitochondrial dynamics is the first reaction of mitochondrial stress. Mitochondrial dynamics refers to the maintenance of the integrity, distribution, and size of mitochondria as well as their ability to resist external stimuli through a continuous cycle of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Therefore, improving mitochondrial dynamics is a vital means of treating CIRI. This review discusses the relationship between mitochondria and CIRI and emphasizes improving mitochondrial dynamics as a potential therapeutic approach to improve the prognosis of CIRI.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial dynamics']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Danlou tablet (Dan) is a kind of Chinese patent medicine used in angina pectoris treatment in China. However, it remains unclear whether and how Dan could protect against cardiac remodeling after myocardial I/RI. In this study, both preventive and therapeutic administration of Dan attenuated ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction at 3 weeks after myocardial I/RI. Dan inhibited Bax/Bcl2 ratio and Caspase3 cleavage in heart tissues and also inhibited apoptosis of human AC16 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes stressed by oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion. Mechanistically, Dan inhibited myocardial apoptosis through phosphorylating AKT and FoxO3a, thereby inhibiting downstream BIM and PUMA expressions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Dan treatment is effective to protect against cardiac remodeling and dysfunction after myocardial I/RI and provide theoretical basis for its cardioprotection and clinical application in treating ischemic cardiac diseases.","['AKT', 'Cardiomyocyte', 'Danlou tablet', 'FoxO3a', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'Ventricular remodeling']",2022-12-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37036302,Remote limb ischemic postconditioning attenuates myocardial dysfunction induced by testicular torsion/detorsion in rats.,"Torsion of the spermatic cord is a urological emergency that must be treated immediately with surgery, yet detorsion of the testis can cause testicular tissue damage because of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. I/R injury is a complex pathophysiological process that may affect the functions of distant organs. Here, we examined whether testicular torsion/detorsion (TT) causes myocardial dysfunction. We next investigated the potential beneficial effect and underlying mechanisms of remote ischemic postconditioning (RIPost) on cardiac function after testicular torsion/detorsion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to three different sets of experimental groups. Testicular I/R was induced by rotating the right testis to 1080° clockwise for 3 h followed by 3 h of detorsion. RIPost was induced at the onset of testicular detorsion by four cycles of 5-min bilateral femoral artery occlusion with 5-min reperfusion. Cardiac function was determined postdetorsion, and the cardioprotective effect of RIPost was examined. Testicular torsion/detorsion-treated rats had reduced serum testosterone levels, impaired systemic hemodynamics, elevated systemic inflammatory responses, and increased serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). However, RIPost attenuated remote heart dysfunction induced by testicular torsion/detorsion. Furthermore, RIPost enhanced the phosphorylation of ventricular signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, which is a key component of the survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) signaling pathways. Inhibition of STAT-3 with Ag490 abolished the RIPost-induced cardioprotection and STAT-3 phosphorylation. Testicular torsion followed by detorsion may cause impaired cardiac function in rats. RIPost effectively attenuates this remote cardiac dysfunction. RIPost-induced protective effects may be mediated by the STAT-3 signaling pathway.","['STAT-3', 'myocardial dysfunction', 'remote ischemic postconditioning', 'testicular torsion/detorsion']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37034179,Reactive oxygen species-responsive HET0016 prodrug-loaded liposomes attenuate neuroinflammation and improve neurological deficit in a rat model of juvenile traumatic brain injury.,"The arachidonic acid pathway metabolite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) contributes to ischemia/reperfusion brain injury. Inhibition of 20-HETE formation can protect the developing brain from global ischemia. In previous studies, we have found that treatment with the 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor N-hydroxy-N-4-butyl-2-methylphenylformamidine (HET0016) can protect the immature brain from traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its hydrophobic nature limits its full potential. We designed a reactive oxygen species-responsive HET0016 prodrug, which consists of a thioketal link between HET0016 and stearyl alcohol (HET-TK-SA), and used the nanoprodrug strategy to successfully synthesize liposomes HET0016 prodrug liposomes (HPLs) to facilitate the application of HET0016 in protection from TBI. HPLs demonstrated spherical shape, size of about 127.8 nm, a zeta potential of -28.8 mv, a narrow particle size distribution and good stability. Male rats at postnatal day 16-17 underwent controlled cortical impact (CCI) followed by intravenous injection with vehicle or HET0016 (1 mg/kg, 2 h post-injury, once/day for 3 days). The results of the in vivo demonstrated that HPLs has good biosafety and can pass through the blood-brain barrier. Not only that compared with HET0016, HPLs better-inhibited inflammation and improved neuronal degeneration, which further led to lesion volume reduction, upgraded behavioral task performance, and ameliorated the degree of TBI impairment. Our results demonstrated HPLs could be a new strategy for juvenile TBI therapy.","['HET0016', 'liposomes', 'neuroinflammation', 'reactive oxygen species responsive', 'traumatic brain injury']",2023-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37033969,GPX3 and GSTT1 as biomarkers related to oxidative stress during renal ischemia reperfusion injuries and their relationship with immune infiltration.,"Renal ischemia reperfusion injuries (IRIs) are very common in clinical diagnoses and treatments, which are a common cause of impaired renal functions, worsening pathological damage, affecting disease progression and hindering recovery. Renal IRIs are an inflammatory disease mediated by the adaptive and innate immune system. There is a complex interaction between oxidative stress and immune cell infiltration. Therefore, we aimed to determine biomarkers associated with oxidative stress during renal IRIs and their relationship with immune cell infiltration.A differential gene expression analysis was made based on the GSE148420 dataset from the NCBI Gene Expression Comprehensive Database (GEO) combined with 92 oxidative-stress (OS)-related genes identified in the Molecular Signatures Database. Then we identified differentially-expressed genes (DEOSGs) associated with oxidative stress, which were used for gene ontology (GO) and a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. At the same time, we used PPI protein interaction networks and Lasso regression analysis to identify key genes, which were verified by the validation sets GSE58438 and GSE71647, as well as Western Blot detection on rat renal IRI models. At the same time, PAS staining, HE staining and immunohistochemistry were used to detect tissue damage and expression of markers related to oxidative stress during renal ischemia-reperfusion. Single-gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to further clarify the underlying biological functions of key genes. Cibersort was used to analyze the immune cell infiltration during renal IRI and the correlation of key genes with immune cells. At the same time, we constructed a network of transcription-factor (TF)-Hub genes and miRNA-Hub genes. DGIDB was used to predict drugs and molecular compounds that might interact with the Hub genes.Compared with the control group, a total of 5456 differential genes (DEGs) were measured in the renal IRI group, 2486 of which were upregulated and 2970 were down-regulated. Among them, we found 30 DEGs (DEOSGs) associated with oxidative stress. The results of GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that these DEOSGs were mainly enriched in glutathione metabolism, the response to oxidative stress stimulation, the regulation of T cell activation and apoptosis signaling pathways. Through a protein interaction network (PPI) and a LASSO regression analysis, a total of two Hub genes were identified, namely GPX3 and GSTT1, which were validated through external validation sets and animal experiments. Through pathological methods, we found that the pathological damage of renal tissue and the expression of oxidative stress markers increased after renal ischemia-reperfusion. The results of GSEA showed that the Hub genes were related to oxidative stress pathways, apoptosis signaling pathways and immune-response-related signaling pathways. An immunoinfiltration correlation analysis showed that genes GPX3 and GSTT1 were significantly positively correlated with plasma cells and macrophage M0, while were negatively correlated with monocytes and macrophages M1 and M2. Using the Strust, Starbase and DGIDB database, we predicted that 81 transcription factors, 49 miRNAs and 13 drug or molecular compounds might interact with the Hub genes.Through a comprehensive analysis of gene expression, our findings may provide new potential biomarkers for the pathogenesis of renal IRIs and a reliable basis for its early diagnosis as well as treatment.","['GPX3', 'immune infiltration', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'kidney', 'oxidative stress']",2023-01-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37033680,Effect of reperfusion strategy on QT dispersion in patients with acute myocardial infarction: Impact on in-hospital arrhythmia.,"Myocardial ischemia and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) increase QT dispersion (QTD) and corrected QT dispersion (QTcD), and are also associated with ventricular arrhythmia.To evaluate the effects of reperfusion strategy [primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or fibrinolytic therapy] on QTD and QTcD in STEMI patients and assess the impact of the chosen strategy on the occurrence of in-hospital arrhythmia.This prospective, observational, multicenter study included 240 patients admitted with STEMI who were treated with either PPCI (group I) or fibrinolytic therapy (group II). QTD and QTcD were measured on admission and 24 hr after reperfusion, and patients were observed to detect in-hospital arrhythmia.There were significant reductions in QTD and QTcD from admission to 24 hr in both group I and group II patients. QTD and QTcD were found to be shorter in group I patients at 24 hr than those in group II (53 ± 19 msec vs 60 ± 18 msec, P = 0.005 and 60 ± 21 msec vs 69+22 msec, P = 0.003, respectively). The occurrence of in-hospital arrhythmia was significantly more frequent in group II than in group I (25 patients, 20.8% vs 8 patients, 6.7%, P = 0.001). Furthermore, QTD and QTcD were higher in patients with in-hospital arrhythmia than those without (P = 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively).In STEMI patients, PPCI and fibrinolytic therapy effectively reduced QTD and QTcD, with a higher observed reduction using PPCI. PPCI was associated with a lower incidence of in-hospital arrhythmia than fibrinolytic therapy. In addition, QTD and QTcD were shorter in patients not experiencing in-hospital arrhythmia than those with arrhythmia.","['Arrhythmia', 'Fibrinolytic therapy', 'Primary percutaneous coronary intervention', 'QT dispersion', 'Reperfusion', 'ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction']",2022-12-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37032421,A randomized porcine study of hemorrhagic shock comparing end-tidal carbon dioxide targeted and proximal systolic blood pressure targeted partial resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta in the mitigation of metabolic injury.,"The definition of partial resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (pREBOA) is not yet determined and clinical markers of the degree of occlusion, metabolic effects and end-organ injury that are clinically monitored in real time are lacking. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) targeted pREBOA causes less metabolic disturbance compared to proximal systolic blood pressure (SBP) targeted pREBOA in a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock.Twenty anesthetized pigs (26-35 kg) were randomized to 45 min of either ETCO2 targeted pREBOA (pREBOAETCO2, ETCO2 90-110% of values before start of occlusion, n = 10) or proximal SBP targeted pREBOA (pREBOASBP, SBP 80-100 mmHg, n = 10), during controlled grade IV hemorrhagic shock. Autotransfusion and reperfusion over 3 h followed. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, blood samples and jejunal specimens were analyzed.ETCO2 was significantly higher in the pREBOAETCO2 group during the occlusion compared to the pREBOASBP group, whereas SBP, femoral arterial mean pressure and abdominal aortic blood flow were similar. During reperfusion, arterial and mesenteric lactate, plasma creatinine and plasma troponin concentrations were higher in the pREBOASBP group.In a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock, ETCO2 targeted pREBOA caused less metabolic disturbance and end-organ damage compared to proximal SBP targeted pREBOA, with no disadvantageous hemodynamic impact. End-tidal CO2 should be investigated in clinical studies as a complementary clinical tool for mitigating ischemic-reperfusion injury when using pREBOA.","['Balloon occlusion', 'Carbon dioxide, Metabolism', 'Chock, hemorrhagic', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injury']",2022-12-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37032049,Development of a Golgi-targeted superoxide anion fluorescent probe for elucidating protein GOLPH3 function in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Superoxide anion (O2•-) is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) and participates in various physiological and pathological processes in the organism. The O2•- burst induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is associated with cardiovascular disease and promotes the cell apoptosis. In this work, a turn-on type Golgi-targeting fluorescent probe Gol-Cou-O2•- was rationally designed for sensitive and selective detection of O2•-. The minimum detection limit concentration for O2•- was about 3.9 × 10-7 M in aqueous solution. Gol-Cou-O2•- showed excellent capacity of detecting exogenous and endogenous O2•- in living cells and zebrafish, and was also used to capture the up-regulated O2•- level during the duration of I/R process in cardiomyocytes. Golgi Phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is a potential Golgi stress marker protein and plays a key role in cells apoptosis during I/R. The fluorescence imaging and flow cytometry assay results indicated that silencing GOLPH3 through siRNA could give rise to the down-regulated O2•- level and alleviation of apoptosis in I/R myocardial cells. Thus, development of Gol-Cou-O2•- provides a diagnostic tool for myocardial oxidative stress injury and distinct insights on roles of GOLPH3 in myocardial I/R injury.","['Apoptosis', 'Fluorescent probe', 'GOLPH3', 'Golgi apparatus', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Superoxide anion']",2022-12-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37031594,Administration of metformin rescues age-related vulnerability to ischemic insults through mitochondrial energy metabolism.,"Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death on a global scale. Despite significant advances in the reperfusion treatment of acute myocardial infarction, there is still a significant early mortality rate among the elderly, as angioplasty-achieved reperfusion can exacerbate myocardial damage, leading to severe ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and induce fatal arrhythmias. Mitochondria are a key mediator of ischemic insults; a transient blockade of the electron transport chain (ETC) at complex I during reperfusion can reduce myocardial infarct caused by ischemic insults. The reversible, transient modulation of complex I during early reperfusion is limited by the available of clinically tractable agents. We employed the novel use of acute, high dose metformin to modulate complex I activity during early reperfusion to decrease cardiac injury in the high-risk aged heart. Young (3-6 months) and aged (22-24 months) male and female C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to in vivo regional ischemia for 45 min, followed by metformin (2 mM, i. v.) injection 5 min prior to reperfusion for 24 h. The cardiac functions were measured with echocardiography. A Seahorse XF24 Analyzer was used to ascertain mitochondrial function. Cardiomyocyte sarcomere shortening and calcium transients were measured using the IonOptix Calcium and Contractility System. The results demonstrated that administration of acute, high dose metformin at the onset of reperfusion significantly limited cardiac damage and rescued cardiac dysfunction caused by I/R in both young and aged mice. Importantly, metformin treatment improves contractile functions of isolated cardiomyocytes and maintains mitochondrial integrity under I/R stress conditions. Thus, acute metformin administration at the onset of reperfusion has potential as a mitochondrial-based therapeutic to mitigate reperfusion injury and reduce infarct size in the elderly heart attack patient who remains at greater mortality risk despite reperfusion alone.","['Aging', 'Ischemic insults', 'Metformin', 'Mitochondria integrity']",2023-03-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37031502,Differences between males and females following endovascular therapy for stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Endovascular therapy (EVT) represents the standard of care for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and large vessel occlusion. To better understand differences in baseline characteristics and outcomes between males and females following EVT, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis.We identified, using the Nested Knowledge AutoLit platform, prospective studies that reported 90-day outcomes in males and females treated with EVT for AIS. The primary outcome of interest was 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2. Secondary outcome variables included mRS 0-1, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score 2b-3, and mortality. Using R software version 4.1.2, we calculated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).We included 10 studies with 10,209 patients. There was no difference between males and females in rate of mRS 0-2 (OR= 1.16; 95% CI= 0.87-1.56; P-value= 0.316); however, after removing outliers, males had higher rates of mRS 0-2 (OR= 1.40; 95% CI= 1.19-1.66; P-value< 0.001). Similar results were reported for mRS 0-1 (OR= 1.21; 95% CI= 0.93-1.56; P-value= 0.15), after removing outliers (OR= 1.32; 95% CI= 1.17-1.50; P-value< 0.001). There was no difference between males and females in rate of sICH (OR= 0.89; 95% CI= 0.74-1.08; P-value= 0.246), mortality (OR= 0.88; 95% CI= 0.74-1.05; P-value= 0.15), or TICI 2b-3 (OR= 1.19; 95% CI= 0.85-1.67; P-value= 0.309).Males tend to experience better outcomes following EVT for AIS, even in the setting of similar reperfusion. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, and further research is warranted. EVT remains a safe and effective option for both males and females with AIS.","['Female', 'Male', 'Outcomes', 'Sex', 'Stroke', 'Thrombectomy']",2022-12-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37030616,Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 alleviates hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in rats.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical pathological change in cerebral ischemia. Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein carrier participating in pyruvate transport. The work is aiming to figure out the effect of MPC1 on cerebral ischemia.Bilateral internal carotid artery embolization (BICAO) model and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model were used to simulate cerebral ischemia in vivo and in vitro. The effect of MPC1 on cerebral ischemia was detected by imaging, behavioral test, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, Western blot and RT-Q-PCR. RNA-sequence (RNA-seq) was applied to explore the potential molecular mechanisms underlying the role of MPC1 in cerebral ischemia.After BICAO or OGD/R treatment, MPC1 expression in ischemic cortical neurons was significantly decreased. And MPC1 deficiency significantly reduced cerebral blood flow, decreased locomotion activities and exacerbated neuronal injury. Moreover, MPC1 deficiency obviously aggravated oxidative stress, structural disruption and dysfunction of mitochondria, autophagy and calcium overload of ischemic cortical neurons. Interestingly, MPC1 overexpression remarkably reversed neuronal loss and persisting neuronal deficits induced by OGD. Using RNA-seq, 38 MPC1-associated differentially expressed genes were involved in oxidative stress, autophagy and calcium overload. Our results further confirmed that MPC1 could alleviate autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the ischemic cortical neurons.MPC1 may exert neuroprotective effects by attenuating oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium overload and autophagy during cerebral ischemia. MPC1-related genes identified by RNA-seq may be a novel therapeutic target for cerebral ischemia.","['Autophagy', 'Bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion', 'Calcium overload', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37030526,Donor graft METTL3 gene transfer ameliorates rat liver transplantation ischemia-reperfusion injury by enhancing HO-1 expression in an m6A-dependent manner.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the most common complications in liver transplantation. METTL3 regulates inflammation and cellular stress response by modulating RNA m6A modification level. Here, the study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of METTL3 in IRI after rat orthotopic liver transplantation. The total RNA m6A modification and METTL3 expression level was consistently down-regulated after 6 h or 24 h reperfusion in OLT, which is negatively associated with the hepatic cell apoptosis. Functionally, METTL3 pretreatment in donor significantly inhibited liver grafts apoptosis, improved liver function and depressed the proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression. Mechanistically, METTL3 inhibited apoptosis of grafts via upregulating HO-1. Moreover, m6A dot blot and MeRIP-qPCR assay revealed that METTL3 promoted HO-1 expression in an m6A-dependent manner. In vitro, METTL3 alleviated hepatocytes apoptosis by upregulating HO-1 under hypoxia/reoxygenation condition. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that METTL3 ameliorates rat OLT-stressed IRI by inducing HO-1 in an m6A-dependent manner, highlighting a potential target for IRI in liver transplantation.","['HO-1', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Liver transplantation', 'METTL3', 'N(6)-methyladenosine']",2022-12-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37029662,Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti-Inflammation and Iron Supplementation.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3 O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+ . An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3 O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN-loaded Fe3 O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In-depth studies indicate that a well-timed iron replenishment following anti-inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti-ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti-inflammation, or even iron elimination.","['acute kidney injury', 'anti-inflammation', 'iron oxide nanoparticles', 'iron supplementation', 'red blood cells']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37029501,NDUFV1 attenuates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by improving mitochondrial homeostasis.,"Impaired mitochondrial function and dysregulated energy metabolism have been shown to be involved in the pathological progression of kidney diseases such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and diabetic nephropathy. Hence, improving mitochondrial function is a promising strategy for treating renal dysfunction. NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit V1 (NDUFV1) is an important subunit of mitochondrial complex I. In the present study, we found that NDUFV1 was reduced in kidneys of renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mice. Meanwhile, renal I/R induced kidney dysfunction as evidenced by increases in BUN and serum creatinine, severe injury of proximal renal tubules, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. All these detrimental outcomes were attenuated by increased expression of NDUFV1 in kidneys. Moreover, knockdown of Ndufv1 aggravated cell insults induced by H2 O2 in TCMK-1 cells, which further confirmed the renoprotective roles of NDUFV1. Mechanistically, NDUFV1 improved the integrity and function of mitochondria, leading to reduced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. Overall, our data indicate that NDUFV1 has an ability to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in AKI, suggesting therapies by targeting mitochondria are useful approaches for dealing with mitochondrial dysfunction associated renal diseases such as AKI.","['NDUFV1', 'acute kidney injury', 'cell apoptosis', 'mitochondrial homeostasis', 'oxidative stress']",2023-01-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Although the molecular mechanism underlying the ischemic pathological cascade is not fully understood, neuroinflammation plays a crucial part in the mortality of retinal ganglion cells.Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), molecular docking, and transfection assay were used to explore the effectiveness and pathogenesis of N,N-dimethyl-3β-hydroxycholenamide (DMHCA)-treated mice with RIR injury and DMHCA-treated microglia after oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R).DMHCA could suppress inflammatory gene expression and attenuate neuronal lesions, restoring the retinal structure in vivo. Using scRNA-seq on the retina of DMHCA-treated mice, we provided novel insights into RIR immunity and demonstrated nerve injury-induced protein 1 (Ninjurin1/Ninj 1) as a promising treatment target for RIR. Moreover, the expression of Ninj1, which was increased in RIR injury and OGD/R-treated microglia, was downregulated in the DMHCA-treated group. DMHCA suppressed the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways induced by OGD/R, which was undermined by the NF-κB pathway agonist betulinic acid. Overexpressed Ninj1 reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic function of DMHCA. Molecular docking indicated that for Ninj1, DMHCA had a low binding energy of - 6.6 kcal/mol, suggesting highly stable binding.Ninj1 may play a pivotal role in microglia-mediated inflammation, while DMHCA could be a potential treatment strategy against RIR injury.","['Inflammation', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Nerve injury-induced protein 1', 'Neuroprotection', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing']",2022-12-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37029182,Sex differences in hepatic ischemia‒reperfusion injury: a cross-sectional study.,"Several studies have shown that males suffer more severe damage than females in the process of ischemia and reperfusion of the brain, heart and kidney. Accordingly, our study will reveal the correlation between the severity of hepatic ischemia‒reperfusion injury (HIRI) and sex, and preliminarily analyze the underlying mechanism. A total of 75 patients who were considered to have ""benign liver tumors"" at the initial admission and underwent partial hepatectomy were enrolled. We identified potential differences between different groups and discussed the correlation between the severity of HIRI and sex through a comparative analysis. Results showed that HIRI was more severe in males than in females, especially in younger patients. To explore whether estrogen level differences are the main reason for the sex differences in HIRI, we further revealed that HIRI in premenopausal females was more severe than that in postmenopausal females. By comparing the levels of gonadal hormones, we speculated that multiple gonadal hormones, including follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone, may jointly participate in the regulation of sex differences in HIRI together with estrogen.",[],2022-11-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Aim of this study was to characterize the electrophysiological and autonomic sequelae of cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) in mice during the first week post incident. Left ventricular function was serially assessed using transthoracic echocardiography. VA were quantified by telemetric electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and electrophysiological studies on the 2nd and 7th day after I/R. Cardiac autonomic function was evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence (HRT). Infarct size was quantified by planimetric measures. I/R caused significant myocardial scarring and diminished left ventricular ejection fraction. The ECG intervals QRS, QT, QTc, and JTc were prolonged in I/R mice. Both spontaneous VA scored higher and the inducibility of VA was raised in I/R mice. An analysis of HRV and HRT indicated a relative reduction in parasympathetic activity and disturbed baroreflex sensitivity up to 7 days after I/R.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) played an important role in AKI and CKD. However, the role and mechanisms of EZH2 in AKI-to-CKD transition are still unclear. Here, we demonstrated EZH2 and H3K27me3 highly upregulated in kidney from patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, and expressed positively with fibrotic lesion and negatively with renal function. Conditional EZH2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition with 3-DZNeP significantly improved renal function and attenuated pathological lesion in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) or folic acid (FA) mice models (two models of AKI-to-CKD transition). Mechanistically, we used CUT & Tag technology to verify that EZH2 binding to the PTEN promoter and regulating its transcription, thus regulating its downstream signaling pathways. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of EZH2 upregulated PTEN expression and suppressed the phosphorylation of EGFR and its downstream signaling ERK1/2 and STAT3, consequently alleviating the partial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), G2/M arrest, and the aberrant secretion of profibrogenic and proinflammatory factors in vivo and vitro experiments. In addition, EZH2 promoted the EMT program induced loss of renal tubular epithelial cell transporters (OAT1, ATPase, and AQP1), and blockade of EZH2 prevented it. We further co-cultured macrophages with the medium of human renal tubular epithelial cells treated with H2O2 and found macrophages transferred to M2 phenotype, and EZH2 could regulate M2 macrophage polarization through STAT6 and PI3K/AKT pathways. These results were further verified in two mice models. Thus, targeted inhibition of EZH2 might be a novel therapy for ameliorating renal fibrosis after acute kidney injury by counteracting partial EMT and blockade of M2 macrophage polarization.",[],2023-01-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Unbiased omics approaches may reveal key renal mediators to initiate IRI. S100-A8/A9 was identified as the most significantly upregulated gene and protein base on proteomic analysis and RNA sequencing during the early reperfusion stage. S100-A8/A9 levels were significantly increased 1 day after transplantation in patients with donation after brain death (DBD). S100-A8/A9 production was associated with CD11b+Ly6G+ CXCR2+ immunocytes infiltration. Administration of S100-A8/A9 blocker ABR238901 significantly alleviates renal tubular injury, inflammatory cell infiltration, and renal fibrosis after renal IRI. Mechanistically, S100-A8/A9 could promote renal tubular cell injury and profibrotic cytokine production via TLR4. In conclusion, our findings found that early activation of S100-A8/A9 in renal IRI and targeting S100-A8/A9 signaling alleviates tubular injury and inhibits inflammatory response and renal fibrosis, which may provide a novel target for the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury.","['Fibrosis', 'Renal ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'S100-A8/A9', 'TLR4 and Proximal tubular epithelial cells']",2022-12-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Such natural compounds have gained significant attention due to their various health benefits. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered unique iron-dependent mode of cell death. Unlike traditional regulated cell death (RCD), ferroptosis is associated with excessive lipid peroxidation on cellular membranes. Accumulating evidence suggests that this form of RCD is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Notably, multiple flavonoids have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating diverse human diseases by regulating ferroptosis. In this review, we introduce the key molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, including iron metabolism, lipid metabolism, and several major antioxidant systems. Additionally, we summarize the promising flavonoids targeting ferroptosis, which provides novel ideas for the management of diseases such as cancer, acute liver injury, neurodegenerative diseases, and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.","['cell death', 'ferroptosis', 'flavonoids', 'human diseases']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37024228,Update on imaging in Code Stroke.,"""Code Stroke"" is a multidisciplinary procedure designed to detect acute ischemic strokes and transfer patients for early reperfusion. Selecting these patients requires multimodal imaging with either CT or MRI. 1) Conventional studies without contrast material are obligatory to detect bleeding. Applying the ASPECTS scale, these studies can also identify and quantify areas of early infarction. 2) In candidates for mechanical thrombectomy, angiographic studies are necessary to identify stenoses and obstructions and to evaluate the collateral circulation. 3) Patients with known onset between 6 and 24h or with unknown onset require perfusion studies to distinguish between infracted tissue and recoverable ischemic tissue.

37023701,Hederagenin ameliorates renal fibrosis in chronic kidney disease through blocking ISG15 regulated JAK/STAT signaling.,"Interstitial fibrosis is the key pathological characteristics of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). In this study, we reported that hederagenin (HDG) can effectively improve the renal interstitial fibrosis and its mechanism. We constructed CKD animal models of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) respectively to observe the improvement effect of HDG on CKD. The results showed that HDG can effectively improve the pathological structure of kidney and the renal fibrosis in CKD mice. Meanwhile, HDG can also significantly reduce the expression of α-SMA and FN induced by TGF-β in Transformed C3H Mouse Kidney-1 (TCMK1) cells. Mechanistically, we performed transcriptome sequencing on UUO kidneys treated with HDG. By real time PCR screening of the sequencing results, we determined that ISG15 plays an important role in the intervention of HDG in CKD. Subsequently, we knocked-down ISG15 in TCMK1 and found that ISG15 knock-down significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced fibrotic protein expression and JAK/STAT activation. Finally, we performed electrotransfection and used liposomes to transfect ISG15 overexpression plasmids to up-regulate ISG15 in kidney and cells, respectively. We found that ISG15 can aggravate renal tubular cell fibrosis and abolish the protection of HDG on CKD. These results indicated that HDG significantly improves renal fibrosis in CKD by inhibiting ISG15 and its downstream JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which provides a new drug and research target for the subsequent treatment of CKD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Fibrosis', 'Hederagenin', 'Interferon-stimulated Gene15', 'JAK/STAT signaling']",2023-02-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37021733,Self-Assembly of Selenium-Doped Carbon Quantum Dots as Antioxidants for Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Management.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a critical complication after liver surgery that negatively affects surgical outcomes of patients with the end-stage liver-related disease. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible for the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury and eventually lead to hepatic dysfunction. Selenium-doped carbon quantum dots (Se-CQDs) with an excellent redox-responsive property can effectively scavenge ROS and protect cells from oxidation. However, the accumulation of Se-CQDs in the liver is extremely low. To address this concern, the fabrication of Se-CQDs-lecithin nanoparticles (Se-LEC NPs) is developed through self-assembly mainly driven by the noncovalent interactions. Lecithin acting as the self-assembly building block also makes a pivotal contribution to the therapeutic performance of Se-LEC NPs due to its capability to react with ROS. The fabricated Se-LEC NPs largely accumulate in the liver, effectively scavenge ROS and inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines, thus exerting beneficial therapeutic efficacy on HIRI. This work may open a new avenue for the design of self-assembled Se-CQDs NPs for the treatment of HIRI and other ROS-related diseases.","['antioxidants', 'hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'reactive oxygen species', 'selenium-doped carbon quantum dots', 'supramolecular chemistry']",2023-01-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37021569,TRIM29 (Tripartite Motif Containing 29) Alleviates NLRC4 (NLR Family CARD Domain Containing Protein 4) Inflammasome Related Cerebral Injury via Promoting Proteasomal Degradation of NLRC4 in Ischemic Stroke.,"Neuroinflammation plays extremely crucial roles in the neurological damage mediated by ischemic stroke. TRIM29 (tripartite motif containing 29) has previously been proposed to contribute to the regulation of innate immunity, however, the effect of TRIM29 on ischemic stroke induced neurodegenerative processes and neuroinflammation still largely unexplored. In the current article, we aimed to investigate the function and the precise mechanisms of TRIM29 in ischemic stroke.Middle cerebral artery occlusion mice model and oxygen-glucose deprivation cell model were established as in vivo and in vitro models of ischemic stroke. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and ELSIA were used to detect the expression levels of TRIM29, cytokines, and marker proteins. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to examine the extent of cell death. Different truncations were generated, and coimmunoprecipitation assays were used to confirm the protein interaction. Ubiquitination assay was performed to detect the ubiquitination levels.We found that the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion induced injury was aggravated in TRIM29 knockout mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion operation as well as the increased neurological deficits score. TRIM29 expression was also found to be up-regulated upon middle cerebral artery occlusion or OGD administration, and loss of TRIM29 promoted the apoptosis and pyroptosis of neurons and microglial cells induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion or OGD, consistent with the enhanced proinflammatory mediators production and activation of NLRC4 (NLR [NOD-like receptor] family CARD [caspase recruitment domain] domain containing protein 4) inflammasome. Furthermore, we observed that TRIM29 interacted with NLRC4 directly and promoted the K48-linked polyubiquitination of NLRC4, lead to the proteasomal degradation of NLRC4.In conclusion, for the first time, we revealed the role of TRIM29 in ischemic stroke and illustrated the direct relationship between TRIM29 and NLRC4.","['ischemic stroke', 'microglia', 'neuroinflammation', 'reperfusion', 'ubiquitination']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37021566,Intensive Blood Pressure Control After Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Optimal blood pressure targets following successful mechanical thrombectomy remain uncertain. While some observational studies suggest that the relationship between blood pressure and outcomes follows a U-shaped curve, others suggest a linear relationship where lower is better. The recent BP-TARGET study (Blood Pressure Target in Acute Stroke to Reduce Hemorrhage After Endovascular Therapy) did not find a benefit to intensive blood pressure lowering regarding the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, but it was not sufficiently powered to detect differences in functional outcomes. On its heels arrived the ENCHANTED2 (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombectomy Stroke Study)/mechanical thrombectomy trial, the first trial of intensive blood pressure lowering in patients with hypertension following successful mechanical thrombectomy powered to detect a difference in functional outcomes. The trial randomized patients to either a systolic blood pressure less than 120 or 140 to 180 mm Hg. The trial was terminated early due to safety concerns in the more intensive blood pressure-lowering group. In this emerging therapy critique, we explore concerns regarding the generalizability of ENCHANTED2/mechanical thrombectomy, including the high prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis in the studied population. We survey mechanisms for poor outcomes in patients who receive overly aggressive blood pressure reduction following successful thrombectomy, such as poststroke autoregulatory compromise and persistent microcirculatory hypoperfusion. Finally, we advocate for a more moderate approach, pending further research.","['blood pressure', 'intracranial hemorrhage', 'reperfusion', 'stroke', 'thrombectomy']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37021144,A dumbbell rescue stent graft facilitates clamp-free repair of aortic injury in a porcine model.,"Noncompressible torso hemorrhage is a high-mortality injury. We previously reported improved outcomes with a retrievable rescue stent graft to temporize aortic hemorrhage in a porcine model while maintaining distal perfusion. A limitation was that the original cylindrical stent graft design prohibited simultaneous vascular repair, given the concern for suture ensnarement of the temporary stent. We hypothesized that a modified, dumbbell-shaped design would preserve distal perfusion and also offer a bloodless plane in the midsection, facilitating repair with the stent graft in place and improve the postrepair hemodynamics.In an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved terminal porcine model, a custom retrievable dumbbell-shaped rescue stent graft (dRS) was fashioned from laser-cut nitinol and polytetrafluoroethylene covering and compared with aortic cross-clamping. Under anesthesia, the descending thoracic aorta was injured and then repaired with cross-clamping (n = 6) or dRS (n = 6). Angiography was performed in both groups. Operations were divided into phases: (1) baseline, (2) thoracic injury with either cross-clamp or dRS deployed, and (3) recovery, after which the clamp or dRS were removed. Target blood loss was 22% to simulate class II or III hemorrhagic shock. Shed blood was recovered with a Cell Saver and reinfused for resuscitation. Renal artery flow rates were recorded at baseline and during the repair phase and reported as a percentage of cardiac output. Phenylephrine pressor requirements were recorded.In contrast with cross-clamped animals, dRS animals demonstrated both operative hemostasis and preserved flow beyond the dRS angiographically. Recovery phase mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and right ventricular end-diastolic volume were significantly higher in dRS animals (P = .033, P = .015, and P = .012, respectively). Whereas distal femoral blood pressures were absent during cross-clamping, among the dRS animals, the carotid and femoral MAPs were not significantly different during the injury phase (P = .504). Cross-clamped animals demonstrated nearly absent renal artery flow, in contrast with dRS animals, which exhibited preserved perfusion (P<.0001). Femoral oxygen levels (partial pressure of oxygen) among a subset of animals further confirmed greater distal oxygenation during dRS deployment compared with cross-clamping (P = .006). After aortic repair and clamp or stent removal, cross-clamped animals demonstrated more significant hypotension, as demonstrated by increased pressor requirements over stented animals (P = .035).Compared with aortic cross-clamping, the dRS model demonstrated superior distal perfusion, while also facilitating simultaneous hemorrhage control and aortic repair. This study demonstrates a promising alternative to aortic cross-clamping to decrease distal ischemia and avoid the unfavorable hemodynamics that accompany clamp reperfusion. Future studies will assess differences in ischemic injury and physiological outcomes.Noncompressible aortic hemorrhage remains a high-mortality injury, and current damage control options are limited by ischemic complications. We have previously reported a retrievable stent graft to allow rapid hemorrhage control, preserved distal perfusion, and removal at the primary repair. The prior cylindrical stent graft was limited by the inability to suture the aorta over the stent graft owing to risk of ensnarement. This large animal study explored a dumbbell retrievable stent with a bloodless plane to allow suture placement with the stent in place. This approach improved distal perfusion and hemodynamics over clamp repair and heralds the potential for aortic repair while avoiding complications.","['Aortic cross-clamp', 'Aortic trauma', 'Endovascular', 'Temporary stent', 'Torso hemorrhage']",2022-11-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Although traditional treatments restore the blood supply of ischemic organs, the damage caused by IRI is always ignored. Therefore, the ideal and effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate IRI is warrented. Curcumin is a type of polyphenols, processing such properties as anti-oxidative stress, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis. However, although many researches have been confirmed that curcumin can exert great effects on the mitigation of IRI, there are still some controversies about its underlying mechanisms among these researches. Thus, this review is to summarize the protective role of curcumin against IRI as well as the controversies of current researches, so as to clarify its underlying mechanisms clearly and provide clinicians a novel idea of the therapy for IRI.","['cell death', 'curcumin', 'inflammation', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'oxidative stress']",2022-09-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37020079,A novel beneficial role of humanin on intestinal apoptosis and dysmotility in a rat model of ischemia reperfusion injury.,"A prevalent clinical problem including sepsis, shock, necrotizing enterocolitis, and mesenteric thrombosis is intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Humanin (HN), a recently identified mitochondrial polypeptide, exhibits antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties. This work aimed to study the role of HN in a model of experimental intestinal I/R injury and its effect on associated dysmotility. A total of 36 male adult albino rats were allocated into 3 equal groups. Sham group: merely a laparotomy was done. I/R group: for 1 h, clamping of the superior mesenteric artery was done, and then reperfusion was allowed for 2 h later. HN-I/R group: rats underwent ischemia and reperfusion, and 30 min before the reperfusion, they received an intraperitoneal injection of 252 μg/kg of HN. Small intestinal motility was evaluated, and jejunal samples were got for biochemical and histological analysis. I/R group showed elevation of intestinal NO, MDA, TNF- α, and IL-6 and decline of GPx and SOD levels. Furthermore, histologically, there were destructed jejunal villi especially their tips and increased tissue expression of caspase-3 and i-NOS, in addition to reduced small intestinal motility. Compared to I/R group, HN-I/R group exhibited decrease intestinal levels of NO, MDA, TNF- α, and IL-6 and increase GPx and SOD. Moreover, there was noticeable improvement of the histopathologic features and decreased caspase-3 and iNOS immunoreactivity, beside enhanced small intestinal motility. HN alleviates inflammation, apoptosis, and intestinal dysmotility encouraged by I/R. Additionally, I/R-induced apoptosis and motility alterations depend partly on the production of nitric oxide.","['Humanin', 'Intestinal motility', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Nitric oxide']",2022-11-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37019923,Post-reperfusion acute MR diffusion in stroke is a potential predictor for clinical outcome in rats.,"Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models show substantial variability in outcome, introducing uncertainties in the evaluation of treatment effects. Early outcome predictors would be essential for prognostic purposes and variability control. We aimed to compare apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) MRI data obtained during MCAO and shortly after reperfusion for their potentials in acute-phase outcome prediction. Fifty-nine male rats underwent a 45-min MCAO. Outcome was defined in three ways: 21-day survival; 24 h midline-shift and neurological scores. Animals were divided into two groups: rats surviving 21 days after MCAO (survival group, n = 46) and rats dying prematurely (non-survival/NS group, n = 13). At reperfusion, NS group showed considerably larger lesion volume and lower mean ADC of the initial lesion site (p < 0.0001), while during occlusion there were no significant group differences. At reperfusion, each survival animal showed decreased lesion volume and increased mean ADC of the initial lesion site compared to those during occlusion (p < 10-6), while NS group showed a mixed pattern. At reperfusion, lesion volume and mean ADC of the initial lesion site were significantly associated with 24 h midline-shift and neurological scores. Diffusion MRI performed soon after reperfusion has a great impact in early-phase outcome prediction, and it works better than the measurement during occlusion.",[],2022-07-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

There is currently no definitive and effective treatment strategy for HIRI. Autophagy is an intracellular self-digestion pathway initiated to remove damaged organelles and proteins, which maintains cell survival, differentiation, and homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that autophagy is involved in the regulation of HIRI. Numerous drugs and treatments can change the outcome of HIRI by controlling the pathways of autophagy. This review mainly discusses the occurrence and development of autophagy, the selection of experimental models for HIRI, and the specific regulatory pathways of autophagy in HIRI.

37019650,Microbleeds Due to Reperfusion Enhance Early Seizures after Carotid Ligation in a Rat Ischemic Model.,"Impaired reperfusion in ischemic brain disease is a condition that we are increasingly confronted with owing to recent advances in reperfusion therapy. In the present study, rat models of reperfusion were investigated to determine the causes of acute seizures using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological specimens. Rat models of bilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by reperfusion and complete occlusion were created. We compared the incidence of seizures, mortality within 24 h, MRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to evaluate ischemic or hemorrhagic changes and metabolites in the brain parenchyma. In addition, the histopathological specimens were compared with those observed on MRI. In multivariate analysis, the predictive factors of mortality were seizure (odds ratios (OR), 106.572), reperfusion or occlusion (OR, 0.056), and the apparent diffusion coefficient value of the striatum (OR, 0.396). The predictive factors of a convulsive seizure were reperfusion or occlusion (OR, 0.007) and the number of round-shaped hyposignals (RHS) on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) (OR, 2.072). The incidence of convulsive seizures was significantly correlated with the number of RHS in the reperfusion model. RHS on SWI was confirmed pathologically as microbleeds in the extravasation of the brain parenchyma and was distributed around the hippocampus and cingulum bundle. MRS analysis showed that the N-acetyl aspartate level was significantly lower in the reperfusion group than in the occlusion group. In the reperfusion model, RHS on SWI was a risk factor for convulsive seizures. The location of the RHS also influenced the incidence of convulsive seizures.","['bilateral carotid artery ligation', 'brain ischemia', 'hyperperfusion', 'reperfusion', 'seizure']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37018976,New insights into the molecular mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors on ventricular remodeling.,"Ventricular remodeling is a pathological process of ventricular response to continuous stimuli such as pressure overload, ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion, which can lead to the change of cardiac structure and function structure, which is central to the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) and is an established prognostic factor in patients with HF. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) get a new hypoglycemic drug that inhibit sodium glucose coconspirator on renal tubular epithelial cells. Recently, clinical trials increasingly and animal experiments increasingly have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors have been largely applied in the fields of cardiovascular diseases, forinstance heart failure, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes cardiomyopathy and other diseases play a cardiovascular protective role in addition to hypoglycemic. These diseases are association with ventricular remodeling. Inhibiting ventricular remodeling can improve the readmission rate and mortality of patients with heart failure. So far, clinical trials and animal experiments demonstrate that the protective effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in the cardiovascular field is bound to inhibit ventricular remodeling. Therefore, this review briefly investigates the molecular mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors on ameliorating ventricular remodeling, and further explore the mechanisms of cardiovascular protection of SGLT2 inhibitors, in order to establish strategies for ventricular remodeling to prevent the progress of heart failure.","['Heart failure', 'Molecular mechanisms', 'SGLT2 inhibitors', 'Ventricular remodeling']",2022-12-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37018938,Highly pathogenic natural monoclonal antibody B4-IgM recognizes a post-translational modification comprised of acetylated N-terminal methionine followed by aspartic or glutamic acid.,"The natural monoclonal antibody B4-IgM recognizes murine annexin 4 (mAn4) and exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury in many mouse models. During apoptosis, the intracellular mAn4 protein translocates to the membrane surface, remaining attached to the outer membrane leaflet where it is recognized by the anti-mAn4 B4-IgM antibody. B4-IgM does not recognize human annexin 4 (hAn4). However, the B4-IgM antibody epitope was detected by Western blot of unknown human proteins and by flow cytometry on all studied human cell lines undergoing apoptosis and on a minor subset of healthy cells. The B4-IgM antibody also recognizes the epitope on necrotic cells in cytoplasmic proteins, apparently entering through pores large enough to allow natural antibodies to penetrate the cells and bind to the epitope expressed on self-proteins. Using proteomics and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that B4-IgM binds to an epitope with post-translationally modified acetylated N-terminal methionine, followed by either glutamic or aspartic acid. The epitope is not induced by apoptosis or injury because this modification can also occur during protein translation. This finding reveals an additional novel mechanism whereby injured cells are detected by natural antibodies that initiate pathogenic complement activation through the recognition of epitopes that are shared across multiple proteins found in variable cell lines.","['Natural antibody', 'antibody epitope', 'necrotic and apoptotic cells', 'protein post-translational modification']",2022-12-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Rats were divided into: ovarian I/R (OIR), ovarian I/R+50 mg/kg metyrosine (OIRM) and sham (SG) operations. OIRM group received 50 mg/kg metyrosine one hour before the application of the anesthetic agent, OIR and SG group rats received equal amount of distilled water to be used as a solvent orally through cannula. Following the application of the anesthetic agent, ovaries of OIRM and OIR group rats were subjected to ischemia and reperfusion, each of which took two hours. This biochemical experiment findings revealed high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and low levels of total glutathione (tGSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) in the ovarian tissue of OIR group, with significant histopathological injury. In metyrosine group, MDA and COX-2 levels were lower than the OIR group whereas tGSH, SOD and COX-1 levels were higher, with slighter histopathological injury. Our experimental findings indicate that metyrosine inhibits oxidative and pro-inflammatory damage associated with ovarian I/R in rats. These findings suggest that metyrosine could be useful in the treatment of ovarian injury associated with I/R.",[],2020-10-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37017889,Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Induced Blood Brain Barrier Dysfunction and the Involved Molecular Mechanism.,"Stroke is characterized by the abrupt failure of blood flow to a specific brain region, resulting in insufficient supply of oxygen and glucose to the ischemic tissues. Timely reperfusion of blood flow can rescue dying tissue but can also lead to secondary damage to both the infarcted tissues and the blood-brain barrier, known as ischemia/reperfusion injury. Both primary and secondary damage result in biphasic opening of the blood-brain barrier, leading to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and vasogenic edema. Importantly, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, inflammation, and microglial activation are critical factors that worsen stroke outcomes. Activated microglia secrete numerous cytokines, chemokines, and inflammatory factors during neuroinflammation, contributing to the second opening of the blood-brain barrier and worsening the outcome of ischemic stroke. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and other microglia-derived molecules have been shown to be involved in the breakdown of blood-brain barrier. Additionally, other non-microglia-derived molecules such as RNA, HSPs, and transporter proteins also participate in the blood-brain barrier breakdown process after ischemic stroke, either in the primary damage stage directly influencing tight junction proteins and endothelial cells, or in the secondary damage stage participating in the following neuroinflammation. This review summarizes the cellular and molecular components of the blood-brain barrier and concludes the association of microglia-derived and non-microglia-derived molecules with blood-brain barrier dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms.","['Blood–brain barrier', 'Cytokines', 'Ion channels', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Microglia', 'Transporters']",2023-01-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion induces mitochondrial dynamics disorders, upregulates the expression of the mitochondrial division protein Fis 1, and inhibits the expression of mitochondrial fusion proteins MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1, while 14, 15-EET treatment reverses this process. Mechanistic studies have shown that 14, 15-EET promotes the phosphorylation of AMPK, upregulates the expression of SIRT1 and phosphorylation of FoxO1, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial division and promoting mitochondrial fusion, preserving mitochondrial dynamics, maintaining neuronal morphological and structural integrity, and alleviating neurological impairment induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion.

37017315,Enhanced protection against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells by puerarin-loaded liposomes modified with matrix metalloproteinases-targeting peptide and triphenylphosphonium.,"Based on the inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, puerarin (PUE) has a good potential to reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI). However, the lack of targeting of free PUE makes it difficult to reach the mitochondria. In this paper, we constructed matrix metalloproteinase-targeting peptide (MMP-TP) and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation co-modified liposomes loaded with PUE (PUE@T/M-L) for mitochondria-targeted drug delivery. PUE@T/M-L had a favorable particle size of 144.9 ± 0.8 nm, an encapsulation efficiency of 78.9 ± 0.6%, and a sustained-release behavior. The results of cytofluorimetric experiments showed that MMP-TP and TPP double-modified liposomes (T/M-L) enhanced intracellular uptake, escaped lysosomal capture, and promoted drug targeting into mitochondria. In addition, PUE@T/M-L enhanced the viability of hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injured H9c2 cells by inhibiting mPTP opening and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reducing Bax expression and increasing Bcl-2 expression. It was inferred that PUE@T/M-L delivered PUE into the mitochondria of H/R injured H9c2 cells, resulting in a significant increase in cellular potency. Based on the ability of MMP-TP to bind the elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), T/M-L had excellent tropism for Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated macrophages and can significantly reduce TNF-α and ROS levels, thus allowing both drug accumulation in ischemic cardiomyocytes and reducing inflammatory stimulation during MI/RI. Fluorescence imaging results of the targeting effect using a DiR probe also indicated that DiR@T/M-L could accumulate and retain in the ischemic myocardium. Taken together, these results demonstrated the promising application of PUE@T/M-L for mitochondria-targeted drug delivery to achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy of PUE.","['Mitochondrial targeting', 'RAW 264.7 cells', 'hypoxia/reoxygenation', 'matrix metalloproteinase-targeting peptide', 'puerarin']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Extracellular high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that contributes to hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). However, the contribution of intracellular HMGB1 to LT graft injury, remains elusive. We hypothesized that intracellular neutrophil-derived HMGB1 from recipients, protects from post-LT EAD.We generated mice with conditional ablation or overexpression of Hmgb1 in hepatocytes, myeloid cells, or both. We performed LTs and injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to evaluate the effect of intracellular HMGB1 in EAD. Ablation of Hmgb1 in hepatocytes and myeloid cells of donors and recipients, exacerbated early allograft injury after LT. Ablation of Hmgb1 from liver grafts, did not affect graft injury; however, lack of Hmgb1 from recipient myeloid cells, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation in liver grafts, and exacerbated injury. Neutrophils lacking HMGB1 were more activated, showed enhanced pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory signatures, and reduced biosynthesis and metabolism of inositol polyphosphates (InsPs). Upon LT reperfusion or LPS treatment, there was significant neutrophil mobilization and infiltration into the liver, and enhanced production of ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines, when intracellular Hmgb1 was absent.

Circulating FGF-23 increases significantly early in the development of AKI, is significantly elevated in patients with CKD and has become a major biomarker of poor clinical prognosis in CKD. However, the potential link between fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and the progression of AKI to CKD remains unclear.Serum FGF-23 levels in AKI patients and ischaemia‒reperfusion injury (IRI) mice were detected with ELISA. Cultured HK2 cells were incubated with FGF-23 and PD173074, a blocker of FGFR, and then TGFβ/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin were examined with immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the expression of COL1A1 and COL4A1. Histologic staining confirmed renal fibrosis.The level of serum FGF-23 was significantly different between AKI patients and healthy controls (P < 0.01). Moreover, serum FGF-23 levels in the CKD progression group were significantly higher than those in the non-CKD progression group of AKI patients (P < 0.01). In the AKI-CKD mouse model, serum FGF-23 levels were increased, and renal fibrosis occurred; moreover, the protein expression of β-catenin and p-Smad3 was upregulated. PD173074 downregulated the expression of β-catenin and p-Smad3 and reduced fibrosis in both mice and HK2 cells.The increase in FGF-23 may be associated with the progression of AKI to CKD and may mediate renal fibrosis via TGF-β and Wnt/β-catenin activation.","['AKI – CKD', 'FGF-23', 'Renal fibrosis']",2022-10-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cx43 can be regulated by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) modification. Protein inhibitor of activated STAT Y (PIASy) is an E3 SUMO ligase for its target proteins. However, whether Cx43 is a target protein of PIASy and whether Cx43 SUMOylation plays a role in I/R-induced arrhythmias are largely unknown.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with PIASy short hairpin RNA (shRNA) using recombinant adeno-associated virus subtype 9 (rAAV9). Two weeks later, the rats were subjected to 45 min of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 h reperfusion. Electrocardiogram was recorded to assess arrhythmias. Rat ventricular tissues were collected for molecular biological measurements.Following 45 min of ischemia, QRS duration and QTc intervals statistically significantly increased, but these values decreased after transfecting PIASy shRNA. PIASy downregulation ameliorated ventricular arrhythmias induced by myocardial I/R, as evidenced by the decreased incidence of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and reduced arrythmia score. In addition, myocardial I/R statistically significantly induced PIASy expression and Cx43 SUMOylation, accompanied by reduced Cx43 phosphorylation and plakophilin 2 (PKP2) expression. Moreover, PIASy downregulation remarkably reduced Cx43 SUMOylation, accompanied by increased Cx43 phosphorylation and PKP2 expression after I/R.PIASy downregulation inhibited Cx43 SUMOylation and increased PKP2 expression, thereby improving ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic/reperfused rats heart.",[],2021-12-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37013735,Momordica charantia reduced ovarian ischemia - reperfusion injury by suppressing APAF-1 expression.,"We investigate the effect of Momordica charantia (MC) against ovarian ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI).Forty-eight Sprague Dawley female rats were divided into 6 groups. 3 hours ischemia/3 hours reperfusion was conducted. Before and/or after IR, 600 mg/kg MC were introduced to rats via an orogastric tube. At the end of the experiment, total serum antioxidant/oxidant status (TAS/TOS) and Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) level were measured. Ovarian histopathology and APAF-1 expression level were analyzed.TAS and AMH levels were the lowest, while TOS level and OSI were the highest in the IR group. TAS and AMH levels were higher, and TOS levels and OSI were lower in MC-treated groups compared to IR group. Follicular degeneration, granulosa and stromal cell degeneration, mononuclear cell infiltration and vascular congestion and dilatation were observed in the IR group. Ovarian histopathology was improved in groups that received MC extract. APAF-1 immune activity was intense in IR and MC+IR groups while decreased in the groups treated with MC extract after IRI. MC treatment downregulated APAF-1 protein after IRI.MC extract restored negative biochemical and histochemical changes caused by IRI due to its antioxidant properties and supported cell survival by suppressing APAF-1 expression.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37013504,Cyanidin-3-glucoside inhibits ferroptosis in renal tubular cells after ischemia/reperfusion injury via the AMPK pathway.,"Ferroptosis, which is characterized by lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of acute renal injury (AKI). Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G), a typical flavonoid that has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on ischemia‒reperfusion (I/R) injury, can induce AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. This study aimed to show that C3G exerts nephroprotective effects against I/R-AKI related ferroptosis by regulating the AMPK pathway.Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced HK-2 cells and I/R-AKI mice were treated with C3G with or without inhibiting AMPK. The level of intracellular free iron, the expression of the ferroptosis-related proteins acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and the levels of the lipid peroxidation markers 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined.We observed the inhibitory effect of C3G on ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo, which was characterized by the reversion of excessive intracellular free iron accumulation, a decrease in 4-HNE, lipid ROS, MDA levels and ACSL4 expression, and an increase in GPX4 expression and glutathione (GSH) levels. Notably, the inhibition of AMPK by CC significantly abrogated the nephroprotective effect of C3G on I/R-AKI models in vivo and in vitro.Our results provide new insight into the nephroprotective effect of C3G on acute I/R-AKI by inhibiting ferroptosis by activating the AMPK pathway.","['AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)', 'Acute kidney injury (AKI)', 'Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G)', 'Ferroptosis', 'Ischemia', 'Lipid peroxidation']",2022-10-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of lncRNA MALAT1 in diabetic cerebral ischemia.Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed to establish diabetic cerebral I/R in vivo. TTC and neurological deficits assessment were performed to assess cerebral ischemic injury. LDH was conducted to detect cytotoxicity. RT-qPCR and western blotting assays were applied to determine mRNA and protein expression. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the pyroptosis of BV2 cells. Immunofluorescence and FISH were conducted for subcellular localization of MALAT1 and STAT1. ELISA was performed to determine cytokine release. Dual luciferase reporter, RIP, and ChIP assays were used to validate the interaction between STAT1 and MALAT1/NLRP3. Diabetes aggravated cerebral injury in vivo and in vitro. Diabetic cerebral ischemia induced inflammatory response and inflammation-induced cell pyroptosis.MALAT1 was overexpressed in diabetic cerebral ischemia models in vivo and in vitro. However, knockdown of MALAT1 suppressed inflammatory response and the pyroptosis of BV2 cells. Moreover, MALAT1 interacted with STAT1 to transcriptionally activate NLRP3. Knockdown of STAT1 significantly reversed the effects of MALAT1. Furthermore, STAT1 promotes the MALAT1 transcription. MALAT1 interacts with STAT1 to promote the pyroptosis of microglias induced by diabetic cerebral ischemia through activating NLRP3 transcription.Thus, knockdown of MALAT1 may be a potential promising therapy target for diabetic cerebral ischemia.","['Cerebral ischemic reperfusion', 'Diabetic cerebral ischemia', 'MALAT1', 'Pyroptosis', 'STAT1']",2022-04-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

We investigate whether RIPoC ameliorates liver injury in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis model.Protocol 1) Rats were administered LPS solution and samples were collected at 0, 2, 6, 12, and 18 h after that. Protocol 2) After RIPoC at 2, 6, and 12 h (L+2R+18H, L+6R+18H, L+12R+18H), samples were analyzed at 18 h. Protocol 3) RIPoC performed at 2 h, analysis samples at 6, 12, 18 h (L+2R+6H, L+2R+12H, L+2R+18H), and RIPoC at 6 h, analysis at 12 h (L+6R+12H). Protocol 4) Rats were divided control group, which were injected with only ketamine and RIPoC group, which RIPoC was performed at 2, 6, 10, and 14 h, samples were analyzed at 18 h.In protocol 1, liver enzymes, MDA, TNF-α and NF-kB increased, and SOD decreased over time.

This study aims to unravel the regulatory mechanism of miR-214-3p in MI/RI via targeting histone demethylase lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A).MI/RI rat model was established by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. MiR-214-3p and KDM3A expression in myocardial tissues of MI/RI rats was examined. Then, the serum oxidative stress factors, inflammatory factors, pathological changes of myocardial tissues, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and fibrosis of myocardial tissues were detected in MI/RI rats intervening with miR-214-3p or KDM3A expression. The targeting relation between miR-214-3p and KDM3A was validated.MiR-214-3p was low-expressed while KDM3A was high-expressed in MI/RI rat model. Up-regulated miR-214-3p or down-regulated KDM3A protected against MI/RI via mitigating serum oxidative response, reducing the levels of inflammatory factors, alleviating the pathological changes of myocardial tissues, and decreasing cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis of myocardial tissue. KDM3A amplification reversed the therapeutic effects of elevated miR-214-3p on MI/RI. KDM3A was targeted by miR-214-3p.miR-214-3p hinders cardiomyocyte apoptosis and myocardial injury in MI/RI rats via regulating KDM3A. Thus, miR-214-3p may function as a potential candidate for MI/RI treatment.","['Apoptosis', 'Inflammatory response', 'Lysine demethylase 3A', 'MicroRNA-214-3p', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Oxidative tress']",2022-06-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37012879,Cardioprotective effects of circ_0002612 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury correlate with disruption of miR-30a-5p-dependent Ppargc1a inhibition.,"Novel mechanistic insights into the effects of circular RNAs (circRNAs) on the physiology and pathology of cardiovascular diseases are under increasingly active investigation. This study defined the cardioprotective role and mechanistic actions of circ_0002612 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI).MI/RI was induced in mice by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery followed by reperfusion, and the in vitro model was established in cultured cardiomyocytes under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditions. Interaction among circ_0002612, miR-30a-5p, Ppargc1a, and NLRP3 was predicted by bioinformatics analysis and further experimentally identified. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of the circ_0002612/miR-30a-5p/Ppargc1a/NLRP3 axis on the cardiac function and myocardial infarction of I/R-injured mice, as well as viability and apoptosis of H/R-challenged cardiomyocytes.In the myocardial tissues of MI/RI mice, miR-30a-5p was negatively correlated with circ_0002612 or Ppargc1a, but circ_0002612 was positively correlated with the expression of Ppargc1a. circ_0002612 competitively bound to miR-30a-5p to release expression of its target gene Ppargc1a. circ_0002612 promoted cardiomyocyte viability while suppressing the apoptosis by impairing the miR-30a-5p-mediated inhibition of Ppargc1a. Additionally, Ppargc1a inhibited the expression of NLRP3 and consequently facilitated cardiomyocyte proliferation while suppressing cell apoptosis. By inhibiting the expression of NLRP3, circ_0002612 protected mice from MI/RI.Overall, this study demonstrates the cardioprotective role of circ_0002612 against MI/RI, which may be a viable target for MI/RI.","['Circ_0002612', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'NLRP3', 'Ppargc1a', 'microRNA-30a-5p']",2022-09-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37011727,Microbiome modulation after severe acute kidney injury accelerates functional recovery and decreases kidney fibrosis.,"Targeting gut microbiota has shown promise to prevent experimental acute kidney injury (AKI). However, this has not been studied in relation to accelerating recovery and preventing fibrosis. Here, we found that modifying gut microbiota with an antibiotic administered after severe ischemic kidney injury in mice, particularly with amoxicillin, accelerated recovery. These indices of recovery included increased glomerular filtration rate, diminution of kidney fibrosis, and reduction of kidney profibrotic gene expression. Amoxicillin was found to increase stool Alistipes, Odoribacter and Stomatobaculum species while significantly depleting Holdemanella and Anaeroplasma. Specifically, amoxicillin treatment reduced kidney CD4+T cells, interleukin (IL)-17 +CD4+T cells, and tumor necrosis factor-α double negative T cells while it increased CD8+T cells and PD1+CD8+T cells. Amoxicillin also increased gut lamina propria CD4+T cells while decreasing CD8+T and IL-17+CD4+T cells. Amoxicillin did not accelerate repair in germ-free or CD8-deficient mice, demonstrating microbiome and CD8+T lymphocytes dependence for amoxicillin protective effects. However, amoxicillin remained effective in CD4-deficient mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation from amoxicillin-treated to germ-free mice reduced kidney fibrosis and increased Foxp3+CD8+T cells. Amoxicillin pre-treatment protected mice against kidney bilateral ischemia reperfusion injury but not cisplatin-induced AKI. Thus, modification of gut bacteria with amoxicillin after severe ischemic AKI is a promising novel therapeutic approach to accelerate recovery of kidney function and mitigate the progression of AKI to chronic kidney disease.","['acute kidney injury', 'amoxicillin', 'glomerular filtration rate', 'gut bacteria', 'kidney repair', 'microbiome']",2022-10-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37011708,"Protease-activated receptors in kidney diseases: A comprehensive review of pathological roles, therapeutic outcomes and challenges.","Studies have demonstrated that protease-activated receptors (PARs) with four subtypes (PAR1-4) are mainly expressed in the renal epithelial, endothelial, and podocyte cells. Some endogenous and urinary proteases, namely thrombin, trypsin, urokinase, and kallikrein released during diseased conditions, are responsible for activating different subtypes of PARs. Each PAR receptor subtype is involved in kidney disease of distinct aetiology. PAR1 and PAR2 have shown differential therapeutic outcomes in rodent models of type-1 and type-2 diabetic kidney diseases due to the distinct etiological basis of each disease type, however such findings need to be confirmed in other diabetic renal injury models. PAR1 and PAR2 blockers have been observed to abolish drug-induced nephrotoxicity in rodents by suppressing tubular inflammation and fibrosis and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, PAR2 inhibition improved autophagy and prevented fibrosis, inflammation, and remodeling in the urethral obstruction model. Only the PAR1/4 subtypes have emerged as a therapeutic target for treating experimentally induced nephrotic syndrome, where their respective antibodies attenuated the podocyte apoptosis induced upon thrombin activation. Strikingly PAR2 and PAR4 subtypes involvement has been tested in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal ischemia-reperfusion injury models. Thus, more studies are required to delineate the role of other subtypes in the sepsis-AKI model. Evidence suggests that PARs regulate oxidative, inflammatory stress, immune cell activation, fibrosis, autophagic flux, and apoptosis during kidney diseases.","['Acute kidney injury (AKI)', 'Diabetes mellitus (DM)', 'Diabetic kidney disease (DKD)', 'Diabetic nephropathy (DN)', 'Endogenous proteases', 'Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)', 'Protease-activated receptors (PARs)']",2023-01-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37011503,Trans-cinnamaldehyde attenuates renal ischemia/reperfusion injury through suppressing inflammation via JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway.,"Inflammation is the major contributor to the mechanisms of acute kidney injury due to renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) is a main bioactive component extracted from the bark of cinnamon and has been proved to have good anti-inflammatory properties. The current study was to demonstrate the effect of TCA on renal IRI and explore its specific mechanism. C57BL/6J mice were injected prophylactically intraperitoneally for TCA 3 days, and IRI for 24 h. In parallel, Human Kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were prophylactically treated with TCA, and then exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) and cobalt chloride (CoCl2). TCA was found to significantly attenuate renal pathological changes and renal dysfunction, and inhibit gene and protein expression of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL). Furthermore, TCA significantly suppressed the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, iNOS, and MCP-1. Mechanistically, the activation of the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway was inhibited by TCA in renal IRI as well as in OGD/R and CoCl2-stimulated cells. However, following pretreatment with anisomycin before OGD/R treatment, we found that the activation of the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway was significantly enhanced, and concomitant abrogation of the TCA inhibitory effect on the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which was followed by a worsening of cell injury that was characterized by an increased number of cell necrosis and an increase in the expression of Kim-1, NGAL as well as proinflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS). In summary, TCA inhibited renal inflammation via the JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and attenuated renal IRI.","['Inflammation', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'JNK/p38 MAPK', 'Trans-Cinnamaldehyde']",2023-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37011424,Three-dimensional-cultured MSC-derived exosome with hydrogel for cerebral ischemia repair.,"Microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response, one of the most essential pathological processes of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, is acknowledged as the main factors leading to poor prognosis of cerebral ischemia. Exosome derived from mesenchymal stem cell (MSC-Exo) exhibits neuroprotective functions by reducing cerebral ischemia-induced neuroinflammatory response and promoting angiogenesis. However, MSC-Exo has disadvantages such as insufficient targeting capability and low production, which limits their clinical applications. Here, we fabricated gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel for three-dimensional (3D) culture of MSCs. It is indicated that 3D environment could simulate the biological niches of MSCs, thereby significantly increasing the cell stemness of MSCs and improving the yield of MSCs-derived exosomes (3D-Exo). In this study, we utilized the modified Longa method to induce middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to interrogate the mechanism of the stronger neuroprotective effect of 3D-Exo. Furthermore, the administration of 3D-Exo in MCAO model could promote neovascularization in infarct region and result in a significant suppression of inflammatory response. This study proposed an exosome-based targeting delivery system for cerebral ischemia and provided a promising strategy for efficient and large-scale production of MSC-Exo.","['3D cell culture', 'Angiogenesis', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Exosome', 'Inflammation']",2022-09-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37011134,Renal-Clearable Probe with Water Solubility and Photostability for Biomarker-Activatable Detection of Acute Kidney Injuries via NIR-II Fluorescence and Optoacoustic Imaging.,"Acute kidney injuries (AKI) have serious short-term or long-term complications with high morbidity and mortality rate, thus posing great health threats. Developing high-performance NIR-II probes for noninvasive in situ detection of AKI via NIR-II fluorescent and optoacoustic dual-mode imaging is of great significance. Yet NIR-II chromophores often feature long conjugation and hydrophobicity, which prevent them from being renal clearable, thus limiting their applications in the detection and imaging of kidney diseases. To fully exploit the advantageous features of heptamethine cyanine dye, while overcoming its relatively poor photostability, and to strive to design a NIR-II probe for the detection and imaging of AKI with dual-mode imaging, herein, we have developed the probe PEG3-HC-PB, which is renal clearable, water soluble, and biomarker activatable and has good photostability. As for the probe, its fluorescence (900-1200 nm) is quenched due to the existence of the electron-pulling phenylboronic group (responsive element), and it exhibits weak absorption with a peak at 830 nm. Meanwhile, in the presence of the overexpressed H2O2 in the renal region in the case of AKI, the phenylboronic group is converted to the phenylhydroxy group, which enhances NIR-II fluorescent emission (900-1200 nm) and absorption (600-900 nm) and eventually produces conspicuous optoacoustic signals and NIR-II fluorescent emission for imaging. This probe enables detection of contrast-agent-induced and ischemia/reperfusion-induced AKI in mice using real-time 3D-MSOT and NIR-II fluorescent dual-mode imaging via response to the biomarker H2O2. Hence, this probe can be used as a practicable tool for detecting AKI; additionally, its design strategy could provide insight into the design of other large-conjugation NIR-II probes with multifarious biological applications.","['NIR-II fluorescence imaging', 'activatable probe', 'acute kidney injury', 'biomarker', 'optoacoustic imaging']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37010740,Combined Application of Human Amniotic Membrane Mesenchymal Stem Cells and a Modified PGS-co-PCL Film in an Experimental Model of Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 3.9 million people die annually of ischemic heart disease (IHD). Several clinical trials have shown that stem cell therapy is a promising therapeutic approach to IHD. Human amniotic membrane mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) positively affect the repair of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury by stimulating endogenous repair mechanisms. The differentiated hAMSCs with and without modified PGS-co-PCL film were applied in the myocardium. MI/R injury was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery in 48 male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into four groups, (n = 12) animals: heart failure (HF) as the control group, HF + MSCs, HF + MSCs + film, and HF + film. Echocardiography was performed 2 and 4 weeks after MI/R injury moreover the expression of the VEGF protein was assessed in the rat heart tissue via immunohistochemistry. In vitro, our result shows fantastic cell survival when seeded on film. In vivo, the left ventricle ejection fraction (LEVD), fractional shortening (FS), end-diastolic (EDV), and stroke volume (SV) have been increased and systolic volumes decreased in all treatment groups in comparison with control. Although combination therapy has a more positive effect on hemodynamic parameters, there is no significant difference between HF + MSCs + film with other treatment groups. Also, In the IHC assay, expression of the VEGF protein significantly increased in all intervention groups. The implantation of MSCs and the modified film significantly enhanced the cardiac functional outcome; in this regard, enhancement in cell survival and VEGF expression are involved as underlying mechanisms in which cardiac film and MSCs exert a beneficial effect.","['Film', 'Ischemia–reperfusion modified PGS-co-PCL', 'Mesenchymal stem cells']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37010675,Inhibition of perilipin 2 attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation both in vivo and in vitro.,"Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) usually causes neuroinflammation within the central nervous system, further prompting irreversible cerebral dysfunction. Perilipin 2 (Plin2), a lipid droplet protein, has been reported to exacerbate the pathological process in different diseases, including inflammatory responses. However, the role and mechanism of Plin2 in CI/R injury are unclear. In this study, the rat models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion (tMCAO/R) were established to mimic I/R injury, and we found that Plin2 was highly expressed in the ischemic penumbra of tMCAO/R rats. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of Plin2 significantly decreased neurological deficit scores and reduced infarct areas in rats induced by I/R. Detailed investigation showed that Plin2 deficiency alleviated inflammation of tMCAO/R rats as evidenced by reduced secretion of proinflammatory factors and the blockade of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In vitro experiments showed that Plin2 expression was upregulated in mouse microglia subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Plin2 knockdown inhibited OGD/R-induced microglia activation and the accumulation of inflammation-related factors. Taken together, this study demonstrates that lipid droplet protein Plin2 contributes to the pathologic process of CI/R damage by impacting inflammatory response and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, Plin2 may provide a new therapeutic direction for CI/R injury.","['Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'NLRP3 inflammasome', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Perilipin 2']",2022-09-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The ischemia group had a significant elevated of TNF- α and caspase-3 while a significant lowered in CAT and SOD levels. The pre-treatment with IFX, the TNF- α and caspase-3 levels lowered significantly, furthermore, significantly increased CAT and SOD levels activity (P≤0.05) as compared with IR group. Among effective groups, I/R+IFX (7mg/kg) group more effective in lowering TNF- α and caspase than I/R+IFX (3mg/kg) group.Conclusions: Infiximab has neuroprotective effective due to its powerful TNF- α blocker and limit ROS release and cell death signaling which protects the neurons from injury during cerebral ischemia reperfusion.","['  TNF-α ', '  apoptosis ', '  inffiximab ', '  ischemia-reperfusion injury ']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37009888,Identification of serum exosomal metabolomic and proteomic profiles for remote ischemic preconditioning.,"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) refers to a brief episode of exposure to potential adverse stimulation and prevents injury during subsequent exposure. RIPC has been shown to increase tolerance to ischemic injury and improve cerebral perfusion status. Exosomes have a variety of activities, such as remodeling the extracellular matrix and transmitting signals to other cells. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular mechanism of RIPC-mediated neuroprotection.Sixty adult male military personnel participants were divided into the control group (n = 30) and the RIPC group (n = 30). We analyzed the differential metabolites and proteins in the serum exosomes of RIPC participants and control subjects.Eighty-seven differentially expressed serum exosomal metabolites were found between the RIPC and control groups, which were enriched in pathways related to tyrosine metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, serotonergic synapses, and multiple neurodegeneration diseases. In addition, there were 75 differentially expressed exosomal proteins between RIPC participants and controls, which involved the regulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) transport, neutrophil degranulation, vesicle-mediated transport, etc. Furthermore, we found differentially expressed theobromine, cyclo gly-pro, hemopexin (HPX), and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), which are associated with neuroprotective benefits in ischemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, five potential metabolite biomarkers, including ethyl salicylate, ethionamide, piperic acid, 2, 6-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxymethylphenol and zerumbone, that separated RIPC from control individuals were identified.Our data suggest that serum exosomal metabolites are promising biomarkers for RIPC, and our results provide a rich dataset and framework for future analyses of cerebral ischemia‒reperfusion injury under ischemia/reperfusion conditions.","['Exosome', 'Metabolomic', 'Proteomic', 'Remote ischemic preconditioning']",2022-12-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37009190,Integrated Analysis of Tracheobronchial Fluid from Before and After Cardiopulmonary Bypass Reveals Activation of the Integrated Stress Response and Altered Pulmonary Microvascular Permeability.,"Objective: We aim to comprehensively describe the transcriptional activity and signaling of pulmonary parenchymal and immune cells before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by using a multi-omic approach coupled with functional cellular assays. We hypothesize that key signaling pathways from specific cells within the lung alter pulmonary endothelial cell function resulting in worsening or improving disease. Methods: We collected serial tracheobronchial lavage samples from intubated patients less than 2-years-old undergoing surgery with CPB. Samples were immediately processed for single cell RNA sequencing (10x Genomics). Cell clustering, cell-type annotation, and visualization were performed, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) between serial samples were identified. Metabolomic and proteomic analyses were performed on the supernatant using mass spectrometry and a multiplex assay (SomaScan) respectively. Functional assays were done using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing to measure resistance across human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Results: Analysis of eight patients showed a heterogeneous mixture of pulmonary parenchymal and immune cells. Cell clustering demonstrated time-dependent changes in the transcriptomic signature indicating altered cellular phenotypes after CPB. DEG analysis was represented by genes involved in host defense, innate immunity, and the mitochondrial respiratory transport chain. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed upregulation of the integrated stress response across all cell types after CPB. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated upregulation of ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. Unbiased proteomic analysis revealed upregulation of proteins involved in cytokine and chemokine pathways. Post-CPB patient supernatant improved HMPEC barrier function, suggesting a protective cellular response to CPB. Conclusion: Children who undergo CPB for cardiac surgery have distinct cell populations, transcriptional activity, and metabolism that change over time. The response to ischemia-reperfusion injury in the lower airway of children appears to be protective, with the need to identify potential targets through future investigations.","['cardiopulmonary bypass', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'multi-omic technology', 'pulmonary endothelial function', 'single cell RNA sequencing']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37009008,Exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells promote angiogenesis and reduce necrotic grade in hindlimb ischemia mouse models.,"Acute hindlimb ischemia is a peripheral arterial disease that severely affects the patient's health. Injection of stem cells-derived exosomes that promote angiogenesis is a promising therapeutic strategy to increase perfusion and repair ischemic tissues. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adipose stem cell-derived exosomes injection (ADSC-Exos) in treating acute mouse hindlimb ischemia.ADSC-Exos were collected via ultracentrifugation. Exosome-specific markers were analyzed via flow cytometry. The morphology of exosomes was detected by TEM. A dose of 100 ug exosomes/100 ul PBS was locally injected into acute mice ischemic hindlimb. The treatment efficacy was evaluated based on the oxygen saturation level, limb function, new blood vessel formation, muscle structure recovery, and limb necrosis grade.ADSC-exosomes expressed high positivity for markers CD9 (76.0%), CD63 (91.2%), and CD81 (99.6%), and have a cup shape. After being injected into the muscle, in the treatment group, many small and short blood vessels formed around the first ligation and grew down toward the second ligation. The SpO2 level, reperfusion, and recovery of the limb function are more positively improved in the treatment group. On day 28, the muscle's histological structure in the treatment group is similar to normal tissue. Approximately 33.33% of the mice had grade I and II lesions and there were no grade III and IV observed in the treatment group. Meanwhile, in the placebo group, 60% had grade I to IV lesions.ADSC-Exos showed the ability to stimulate angiogenesis and significantly reduce the rate of limb necrosis.","['Acute', 'Adipose-derived stem cells', 'Angiogenesis', 'Exosome', 'Extracellular vesicles', 'Limb ischemia']",2022-09-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37008319,Normothermic ex vivo heart perfusion with NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor Mcc950 treatment improves cardiac function of circulatory death hearts after transplantation.,"The utilization of donation after circulatory death (DCD) hearts can enlarge the donor pool. However, DCD hearts suffer from serious ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Recent studies found that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome could play a significant role in organ IRI. Mcc950, which is a novel inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, can be applied to treat various kinds of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that the treatment of mcc950 could protect DCD hearts preserved with normothermic ex vivo heart perfusion (EVHP) against myocardial IRI via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome in a rat heart transplantation model of DCD.Donor-heart rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control group; Vehicle group; MP-mcc950 group; and MP + PO-mcc950 group. Mcc950 was added into the perfusate of normothermic EVHP in the MP-mcc950 and MP + PO-mcc950 groups, and was injected into the left external jugular vein after heart transplantation in the MP + PO-mcc950 group. Cardiac functional assessment was performed. The level of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated protein of donor hearts were evaluated.The treatment with mcc950 significantly increased the developed pressure (DP), dP/dtmax, and dP/dtmin of the left ventricular of DCD hearts at 90 min after heart transplantation in both MP-mcc950 and MP + PO-mcc950 groups. Furthermore, mcc950 added into perfusate and injected after transplantation in both MP-mcc950 and MP + PO-mcc950 groups significantly attenuated the level of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome compared with the vehicle group.Normothermic EVHP combined with mcc950 treatment can be a promising and novel DCD heart preservation strategy, which can alleviate myocardial IRI via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome.","['MCC950', 'NLRP3', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'donation after circulatory death', 'heart transplantation', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury']",2022-12-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37006883,miR‑30c reduces myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by targeting SOX9 and suppressing pyroptosis.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are commonly involved in regulating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by binding and silencing their target genes. However, whether miRNAs regulate myocardial I/R-induced pyroptosis remains unclear. The present study established an in vivo rat model of myocardial I/R injury and in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model in rat primary cardiomyocytes to investigate the function and the underlying mechanisms of miRNAs on I/R injury-induced pyroptosis. RNA sequencing was utilized to select the candidate miRNAs between normal and I/R group. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting were performed to detect candidate miRNAs (miR-30c-5p, also known as miR-30c) and SRY-related high mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX9) expression, as well as expression of pyroptosis-associated proteins (NF-κB, ASC, caspase-1, NLRP3) in the myocardial I/R model. ELISA was used to measure pyroptosis-associated inflammatory markers IL-18 and IL-1β. Moreover, the link between miR-30c and SOX9 was predicted using bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assay. In myocardial I/R injured rats, miR-30c was downregulated, while the expression of SOX9 was upregulated. Overexpression of miR-30c inhibited pyroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, miR-30c negatively regulated SOX9 expression by binding its 3'untranslated region. In conclusion, the miR-30c/SOX9 axis decreased myocardial I/R injury by suppressing pyroptosis, which may be a potential therapeutic target.","['SRY-related high mobility group-Box gene 9', 'microRNA-30c', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'pyroptosis']",2022-11-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37006873,4'‑O‑methylbavachalcone inhibits succinate induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via the NFATc4 pathway.,"Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for complications such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, sudden mortality and heart failure. Succinate, an intermediate product of the Krebs cycle, is released into the bloodstream by cells; its levels increase with exacerbations of hypertension, myocardial and other tissue damage and metabolic disease. Succinate may also be involved in several metabolic pathways and mediates numerous pathological effects through its receptor, succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1; previously known as GPR91). Succinate-induced activation of SUCNR1 has been reported to be related to cardiac hypertrophy, making SUCNR1 a potential target for treating cardiac hypertrophy. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and its active ingredients have served important roles in improving cardiac functions and treating heart failure. The present study investigated whether 4'-O-methylbavachadone (MeBavaC), an active ingredient of the herbal remedy Fructus Psoraleae, which is often used in TCM and has protective effect on myocardial injury and hypertrophy induced by adriamycin, ischemia-reperfusion and sepsis, could ameliorate succinate-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting the NFATc4 pathway. Using immunofluorescence staining, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, western blotting and molecular docking analysis, it was determined that succinate activated the calcineurin/NFATc4 and ERK1/2 pathways to promote cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. MeBavaC inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, nuclear translocation of NFATc4 and ERK1/2 signaling activation in succinate-induced cardiomyocytes. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MeBavaC interacts with SUCNR1 to form a relatively stable binding and inhibits the succinate-SUCNR1 interaction. The results demonstrated that MeBavaC suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by blocking SUCNR1 receptor activity and inhibiting NFATc4 and ERK1/2 signaling, which will contribute to the preclinical development of this compound.","[""4'-O-methylbavachalcone"", 'cardiomyocyte hypertrophy', 'nuclear factor activated T cell', 'succinate', 'succinate receptor 1']",2022-09-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37006305,Analysis of potential immune-related genes involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion injury following liver transplantation.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is an unavoidable pathological process that occurs after liver transplantation. However, the immune-related molecular mechanism still remains unclear. This study aims to further explore the biological mechanisms of immune-related genes in hepatic I/R injury.Gene microarray data was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) expression profile database and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were taken for intersection. After identifying common DEGs, functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and modular construction were performed. The immune-related hub genes were obtained, which their upstream transcription factors and non-RNAs were predicted. Validation of the hub genes expression and immune infiltration were performed in a mouse model of hepatic I/R injury.A total of 71 common DEGs were obtained from three datasets (GSE12720, GSE14951, GSE15480). The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis results indicated that immune and inflammatory response played an important role in hepatic I/R injury. Finally, 9 immune-related hub genes were identified by intersecting cytoHubba with immune-related genes, including SOCS3, JUND, CCL4, NFKBIA, CXCL8, ICAM1, IRF1, TNFAIP3, and JUN.Our study revealed the importance of the immune and inflammatory response in I/R injury following liver transplantation and provided new insights into the therapeutic of hepatic I/R injury.","['differentially expressed genes', 'hub genes', 'immune', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'liver transplantation']",2022-12-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37005848,[Chrysin alleviates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting ferroptosis in rats].,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether chrysin reduces cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury(CIRI) by inhi-biting ferroptosis in rats. Male SD rats were randomly divided into a sham group, a model group, high-, medium-, and low-dose chrysin groups(200, 100, and 50 mg·kg~(-1)), and a positive drug group(Ginaton, 21.6 mg·kg~(-1)). The CIRI model was induced in rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion(tMCAO). The indexes were evaluated and the samples were taken 24 h after the operation. The neurological deficit score was used to detect neurological function. The 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride(TTC) staining was used to detect the cerebral infarction area. Hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining and Nissl staining were used to observe the morphological structure of brain tissues. Prussian blue staining was used to observe the iron accumulation in the brain. Total iron, lipid pero-xide, and malondialdehyde in serum and brain tissues were detected by biochemical reagents. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR), immunohistochemistry, and Western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of solute carrier fa-mily 7 member 11(SLC7A11), transferrin receptor 1(TFR1), glutathione peroxidase 4(GPX4), acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4(ACSL4), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2(PTGS2) in brain tissues. Compared with the model group, the groups with drug intervention showed restored neurological function, decreased cerebral infarction rate, and alleviated pathological changes. The low-dose chrysin group was selected as the optimal dosing group. Compared with the model group, the chrysin groups showed reduced content of total iron, lipid peroxide, and malondialdehyde in brain tissues and serum, increased mRNA and protein expression levels of SLC7A11 and GPX4, and decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of TFR1, PTGS2, and ACSL4. Chrysin may regulate iron metabolism via regulating the related targets of ferroptosis and inhibit neuronal ferroptosis induced by CIRI.","['animal experiments', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'chrysin', 'ferroptosis', 'pharmacological mechanism']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37005847,[Bombyx Batryticatus extract promotes microglia polarization to improve neuron injury and behaviors of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats].,"This study aims to investigate the effect of Bombyx Batryticatus extract(BBE) on behaviors of rats with global cerebral ischemia reperfusion(I/R) and the underlying mechanism. The automatic coagulometer was used to detect the four indices of human plasma coagulation after BBE intervention for quality control of the extract. Sixty 4-week-old male SD rats were randomized into sham operation group(equivalent volume of normal saline, ip), model group(equivalent volume of normal saline, ip), positive drug group(900 IU·kg~(-1) heparin, ip), and low-, medium-, and high-dose BBE groups(0.45, 0.9, and 1.8 mg·g~(-1)·d~(-1) BBE, ip). Except the sham operation group, rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion followed by reperfusion(BCCAO/R) to induce I/R. The administration lasted 7 days for all the groups. The behaviors of rats were examined by beam balance test(BBT). Morphological changes of brain tissue were observed based on hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining. Immunofluorescence method was used to detect common leukocyte antigen(CD45), leukocyte differentiation antigen(CD11b), and arginase-1(Arg-1) in cerebral cortex(CC). The protein expression of interleukin-1β(IL-1β), interleukin-4(IL-4), interleukin-6(IL-6), and interleukin-10(IL-10) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). The non-targeted metabonomics was employed to detect the levels of metabolites in plasma and CC of rats after BBE intervention. The results of quality control showed that the BBE prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time(APTT), prothrombin time(PT), and thrombin time(TT) of human plasma, which was similar to the anticoagulation effect of BBE obtained previously. The results of behavioral test showed that the BBT score of the model group increased compared with that of the sham operation group. Compared with the model group, BBE reduced the BBT score. As for the histomorphological examination, compared with the sham operation group, the model group showed morphological changes of a lot of nerve cells in CC. The nerve cells with abnormal morphology in CC decreased after the intervention of BBE compared with those in the model group. Compared with the sham operation group, the model group had high average fluorescence intensity of CD45 and CD11b in the CC. The average fluorescence intensity of CD11b decreased and the average fluorescence intensity of Arg-1 increased in CC in the low-dose BBE group compared with those in the model group. The average fluorescence intensity of CD45 and CD11b decreased and the average fluorescence intensity of Arg-1 increased in medium-and high-dose BBE groups compared with those in the model group. The expression of IL-1β and IL-6 was higher and the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 was lower in the model group than in the sham operation group. The expression of IL-1β and IL-6 was lower and the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 was higher in the low-dose, medium-dose, and high-dose BBE groups than in the model group. The results of non-targeted metabonomics showed that 809 metabolites of BBE were identified, and 57 new metabolites in rat plasma and 45 new metabolites in rat CC were found. BBE with anticoagulant effect can improve the behaviors of I/R rats, and the mechanism is that it promotes the polarization of microglia to M2 type, enhances its anti-inflammatory and phagocytic functions, and thus alleviates the damage of nerve cells in CC.","['Bombyx Batryticatus extract', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'ischemic stroke', 'microglia']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37005832,[Protective mechanism of tetramethylpyrazine on cardiovascular system].,"Tetramethylpyrazine is the main component of Ligusticum chuanxiong. Studies have found that tetramethylpyrazine has a good protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. In the heart, tetramethylpyrazine can reduce myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting oxidative stress, regulating autophagy, and inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Tetramethylpyrazine can also reduce the damage of cardiomyocytes caused by inflammation, relieve the fibrosis and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes in infarcted myocardium, and inhibit the expansion of the cardiac cavity after myocardial infarction. In addition, tetramethylpyrazine also has a protective effect on the improvement of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Besides, the mechanisms of tetramethylpyrazine on blood vessels are more abundant. It can inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis by reducing oxidative stress, maintain vascular endothelial function and homeostasis by inhibiting inflammation and glycocalyx degradation, and protect vascular endothelial cells by reducing iron overload. Tetramethylpyrazine also has a certain inhibitory effect on thrombosis. It can play an anti-thrombotic effect by reducing inflammatory factors and adhesion molecules, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and suppressing the expression of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. In addition, tetramethylpyrazine can also reduce the level of blood lipid in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, inhibit the subcutaneous deposition of lipids, inhibit the transformation of macrophages into foam cells, and inhibit the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby reducing the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In combination with network pharmacology, the protective mechanism of tetramethylpyrazine on the cardiovascular system may be mainly achieved through the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B(PI3K/Akt), hypoxia-inducible factor 1(HIF-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase(MAPK) pathways. Tetramethylpyrazine hydrochloride and sodium chloride injection has been approved for clinical application, but some adverse reactions have been found in clinical application, which need to be paid attention to.","['inflammation', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'lipid', 'tetramethylpyrazine', 'thrombus', 'vascular endothelial cells', 'vascular smooth muscle cells']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37005813,[Protective effects of three kinds of borneol on different brain regions in acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model rats].,"This study compared the ameliorating effects of L-borneol, natural borneol, and synthetic borneol on the injury of different brain regions in the rat model of acute phase of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion(I/R) for the first time, which provides a reference for guiding the rational application of borneol in the early treatment of ischemic stroke and has important academic and application values. Healthy specific pathogen-free(SPF)-grade SD male rats were randomly assigned into 13 groups: a sham-operation group, a model group, a Tween model group, a positive drug(nimodipine) group, and high-, medium-, and low-dose(0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 g·kg~(-1), respectively) groups of L-borneol, natural borneol, and synthetic borneol according to body weight. After 3 days of pre-administration, the rat model of I/R was established by suture-occluded method and confirmed by laser speckle imaging. The corresponding agents in different groups were then administered for 1 day. The body temperature was monitored regularly before pre-administration, days 1, 2, and 3 of pre-administration, 2 h after model awakening, and 1 d after model establishment. Neurological function was evaluated based on Zea-Longa score and modified neurological severity score(mNSS) 2 h and next day after awakening. The rats were anesthetized 30 min after the last administration, and blood was collected from the abdominal aorta. Enzyme-linked immunoassay assay(ELISA) was employed to determine the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-α), interleukin-6(IL-6), IL-4, and transforming growth factor-beta1(TGF-β1). The brain tissues were stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride(TTC) for the calculation of cerebral infarction rate, and hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining was used for observing and semi-quantitatively evaluating the pathological damage in different brain regions. Immunohistochemistry was employed to detect the expression of ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1(IBA1) in microglia. q-PCR was carried out to determine the mRNA levels of iNOS and arginase 1(Arg1), markers of polarization phenotype M1 and M2 in microglia. Compared with the sham-operation group, the model group and the Tween model group showed significantly elevated body temperature, Zea-Longa score, mNSS, and cerebral infarction rate, severely damaged cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, increased serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, and decreased serum levels of IL-4 and TGF-β1. The three borneol products had a tendency to reduce the body temperature of rats 1 day after modeling. Synthetic borneol at the doses of 0.2 and 0.05 g·kg~(-1), as well as L-borneol of 0.1 g·kg~(-1), significantly reduced Zea-Longa score and mNSS. The three borneol products at the dose of 0.2 g·kg~(-1) significantly reduced the cerebral infarction rate. L-borneol at the doses of 0.2 and 0.1 g·kg~(-1) and natural borneol at the dose of 0.1 g·kg~(-1) significantly reduced the pathological damage of the cortex. L-borneol and natural borneol at the dose of 0.1 g·kg~(-1) attenuated the pathological damage of hippocampus, and 0.2 g·kg~(-1) L-borneol attenuated the damage of striatum. The 0.2 g·kg~(-1) L-borneol and the three doses of natural borneol and synthetic borneol significantly reduced the serum level of TNF-α, and the 0.1 g·kg~(-1) synthetic borneol reduced the level of IL-6. L-borneol and synthetic borneol at the dose of 0.2 g·kg~(-1) significantly inhibited the activation of cortical microglia, and 0.2 g·kg~(-1) L-borneol up-regulated the expression of Arg1 and down-regulated the expression level of iNOS. In conclusion, the three borneol products may alleviate inflammation to ameliorate the pathological damage of brain regions of rats in the acute phase of I/R by inhibiting the activation of microglia and promoting the polarization of microglia from M1 type to M2 type. The protective effect on brain followed a trend of L-borneol &gt; synthetic borneol &gt; natural borneol. We suggest L-borneol the first choice for the treatment of I/R in the acute phase.","['borneol', 'cerebral ischemia', 'different brain regions', 'inflammation', 'microglia']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37005492,Lin28 promoting the protective effect of PMSCs on hepatic ischaemia-reperfusion injury by regulating glucose metabolism.,"Human placental mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) can prevent liver ischaemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI). However, their therapeutic effects are limited. Therefore, additional research is required to elucidate the mechanisms of PMSC-mediated LIRI prevention and enhance the related therapeutic effects. This study aimed to examine the role of the Lin28 protein in the regulation of glucose metabolism in PMSCs. Further, it explored whether Lin28 could enhance the protective effects of PMSCs against LIRI and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Western blotting was performed to examine Lin28 expression in PMSCs under hypoxic conditions. A Lin28 overexpression construct was introduced into PMSCs, and the effect on glucose metabolism was examined using a glucose metabolism kit. Further, the expression of some proteins involved in glucose metabolism and the PI3K-AKT pathway and the levels of microRNA Let-7a-g were examined using western blots and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. To examine the relationship between Lin28 and the PI3K-Akt pathway, the effects of AKT inhibitor treatment on the changes induced by Lin28 overexpression were examined. Subsequently, AML12 cells were co-cultured with PMSCs to elucidate the mechanisms via which PMSCs prevent hypoxic injury in liver cells in vitro. Finally, C57BL/6J mice were used to establish a partial warm ischaemia-reperfusion model. The mice received intravenous injections containing PMSCs (control and Lin28-overexpressing PMSCs). Finally, their serum transaminase levels and degree of liver injury were assessed using biochemical and histopathological methods, respectively. Lin28 was upregulated under hypoxic conditions in PMSCs. Lin28 exerted protective effects against hypoxia-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, it increased the glycolytic capacity of PMSCs, allowing PMSCs to produce more energy under hypoxic conditions. Lin28 also activated the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway under hypoxic conditions, and its effects were attenuated by AKT inhibition. Lin28 overexpression could protect cells against LIRI-induced liver damage, inflammation and apoptosis and could also attenuate hypoxia-induced hepatocyte injury. Lin28 enhances glucose metabolism under hypoxic conditions in PMSCs, thereby exerting protective effects against LIRI by activating the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway. Our study is the first to report the potential of genetically modified PMSCs for LIRI treatment.","['PI3K-Akt pathway', 'glucose metabolism', 'human placental mesenchymal stem cells', 'lactate dehydrogenase a', 'liver ischaemia-reperfusion injury']",2022-04-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, data on these patients remain limited. We aimed to compare the characteristics and AMI prognosis of patients transferred to our EMCC with those transferred to our cardiovascular intensive care unit (CICU) using whole and propensity-matched cohorts.We analyzed the data of 256 consecutive AMI patients transferred from the scene to our hospital by ambulance between 2014 and 2017. The EMCC and CICU groups comprised 77 and 179 patients, respectively. There were no significant between-group age or sex differences. Patients in the EMCC group had more disease severity score and had the left main trunk identified as the culprit more frequently (12% versus 0.6%, P < 0.001) than those in the CICU group; however, the number of patients with multiple culprit vessels did not differ. The EMCC group had a longer door-to-reperfusion time (75 [60, 109] minutes versus 60 [40, 86] minutes, P< 0.001) and a higher in-hospital mortality (19% versus 4.5%, P < 0.001), especially from non-cardiac causes (10% versus 0.6%, P < 0.001), than the CICU group. However, peak myocardial creatine phosphokinase did not significantly differ between the groups. The EMCC group had a significantly higher 1-year post-discharge mortality than the CICU group (log-rank, P = 0.032); this trend was maintained after propensity score matching, although the difference was not statistically significant (log-rank, P = 0.094).AMI patients transferred to the EMCC exhibited more severe disease and worse overall in-hospital and non-cardiac mortality than those transferred to the CICU.","['Cardiac death', 'In-hospital mortality', 'Non-cardiac death', 'Severe conditions', 'Tertiary emergency']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

37004834,An update on the molecular mechanism and pharmacological interventions for Ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in autophagy.,"AMP-activated protein kinase (5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an important signaling pathway maintaining normal cell function and homeostasis in vivo. The AMPK/mTOR pathway regulates cellular proliferation, autophagy, and apoptosis. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is secondary damage that frequently occurs clinically in various disease processes and treatments, and the exacerbated injury during tissue reperfusion increases disease-associated morbidity and mortality. IRI arises from multiple complex pathological mechanisms, among which cell autophagy is a focus of recent research and a new therapeutic target. The activation of AMPK/mTOR signaling in IRI can modulate cellular metabolism and regulate cell proliferation and immune cell differentiation by adjusting gene transcription and protein synthesis. Thus, the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway has been intensively investigated in studies focused on IRI prevention and treatment. In recent years, AMPK/mTOR pathway-mediated autophagy has been found to play a crucial role in IRI treatment. This article aims to elaborate the action mechanisms of AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway activation in IRI and summarize the progress of AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy research in the field of IRI therapy.",['AMPK/mTOR autophagy IRI research progress'],2023-01-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37004745,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that VIM and IFITM3 are vital targets of Dengzhan Shengmai capsule to protect against cerebral ischemic injury.,"Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality, but therapies are limited. Dengzhan Shengmai capsule (DZSM) was included by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020 and has been broadly used for the treatment of ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism of DZSM against ischemic stroke is unclear.This study used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to investigate the mechanism of action of DZSM against ischemic stroke.The rats were randomly divided into six groups: the Sham, I/R (water), I/R + DZSM-L (0.1134g/kg), I/R + DZSM-H (0.4536g/kg), I/R + NMDP (20mg/kg), and I/R + Ginaton (20mg/kg). The rats were administrated drugs for 5 days then followed by the ischemic brain injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The neuroprotective effect was assessed by infraction rate, neurological deficit scores, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and Nissl staining. Based on RNA-seq and scRNA-seq, the vital biological processes and core targets of DZSM against cerebral ischemia were revealed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were used to investigate the vital biological processes and core targets of DZSM against ischemic stroke.Administration of DZSM significantly reduced the infarction rate and Zea Longa score, Garcia JH score, and ameliorated the reduction in rCBF. And alleviated the neuronal damage, such as increased neuronal density level and Nissl bodies density level. RNA-seq analysis revealed that DZSM played important roles in inflammation and apoptosis. ELISA and IF straining validation confirmed that DZSM significantly decreased the expression of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, ICAM-1, IBA-1, MMP9, and Cleaved caspase-3 in MCAO rats. ScRNA-seq analysis identified 8 core targets in neurons including HSPB1, SPP1, MT2A, GFAP, IFITM3, VIM, CRIP1, and GPD1, and VIM and IFITM3 was verified to be decreased by DZSM in neurons.Our study illustrates the neuroprotective effect of DZSM against ischemia stroke, and VIM and IFITM3 were identified as vital targets in neurons of DZSM in protecting against MCAO-induced I/R injury.","['Dengzhan Shengmai capsule (DZSM)', 'IFITM3', 'Ischemic stroke', 'RNA-seq', 'VIM', 'scRNA-seq']",2023-01-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37004699,Gut microbiota regulates circadian oscillation in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced cognitive impairment by interfering with hippocampal lipid metabolism in mice.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a common complication of liver surgery, which can lead to extrahepatic metabolic disorders, such as cognitive impairment. Recent observations have emphasized the critical effects of gut microbial metabolites in regulating the development of liver injury. Herein, we investigated the potential contribution of gut microbiota to HIRI-related cognitive impairment.HIRI murine models were established by ischemia-reperfusion surgery in the morning (ZT0, 08:00) and evening (ZT12, 20:00), respectively. Antibiotic-induced pseudo-germ-free mice were gavaged with fecal bacteria of the HIRI models. Behavioral test was used to assess cognitive function. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics were used for microbial and hippocampal analysis.Our results established that cognitive impairment caused by HIRI underwent diurnal oscillations; HIRI mice performed poorly on the Y-maze test and the novel object preference test when surgery occurred in the evening compared with the morning. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from the ZT12-HIRI was demonstrated to induce cognitive impairment behavior. The specific composition and metabolites of gut microbiota were analyzed between the ZT0-HIRI and ZT12-HIRI, and bioinformatic analysis showed that the differential fecal metabolites were significantly enriched in lipid metabolism pathways. After FMT, the hippocampal lipid metabolome between the P-ZT0-HIRI and P-ZT12-HIRI groups was analyzed to reveal a series of lipid molecules with significant differences.Our findings indicate that gut microbiota are involved in circadian differences of HIRI-related cognitive impairment by affecting hippocampal lipid metabolism.","['Circadian oscillation', 'Cognitive disorders', 'Dysbiosis', 'Fecal metabolites', 'Fecal microbiota transplantation', 'Gut microbiota', 'Hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Hippocampus', 'Lipid metabolism', 'Metabolomics']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37004326,Mechanistic correlation between mitochondrial permeability transition pores and mitochondrial ATP dependent potassium channels in ischemia reperfusion.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the fundamental causes of ischemia reperfusion (I/R) damage. I/R refers to the paradoxical progression of cellular dysfunction and death that occurs when blood flow is restored to previously ischemic tissues. I/R causes a significant rise in mitochondrial permeability resulting in the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP). The MPTP are broad, nonspecific channels present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and are known to mediate the deadly permeability alterations that trigger mitochondrial driven cell death. Protection from reperfusion injury occurs when long-term ischemia is accompanied by short-term ischemic episodes or inhibition of MPTP from opening via mitochondrial ATP dependent potassium (mitoKATP) channels. These channels located in the IMM, play an essential role in ischemia preconditioning (PC) and protect against cell death by blocking MPTP opening. This review primarily focuses on the interaction between the MPTP and mitoKATP along with their role in the I/R injury. This article also describes the molecular composition of the MPTP and mitoKATP in order to promote future knowledge and treatment of diverse I/R injuries in various organs.","['Ischemia reperfusion', 'Mitochondrial ATP dependent potassium channels', 'Mitochondrial permeability transition pores', 'Protein kinase C', 'Reactive oxygen species']",2023-01-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37002530,Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Exosomal KLF4 Alleviated Ischemic Stroke Through Inhibiting N6-Methyladenosine Modification Level of Drp1 by Targeting lncRNA-ZFAS1.,"Ischemic stroke has become a serious public health problem that causes high rates of death and disability. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes have shown promising therapeutic results in IS, while the underlying mechanisms need further investigation. Cell and mice models were established through oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/reperfusion. Exosomes were isolated from BMSCs. Related gene and protein expression was measured by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence analysis. The biological functions of treated cells and tissues were analyzed by MTT, ELISA, JC-1, flow cytometry, TTC staining, or TUNEL staining. The interaction of KLF4/lncRNA-ZFAS1 promoter and lncRNA-ZFAS1/FTO was measured by ChIP, dual-luciferase reporter, or RIP assays. The m6A levels of Drp1 were measured by MeRIP-PCR. Mitochondrial staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to evaluate the mitochondrial morphology in N2a cells and brain tissues. BMSC-derived exosomes increased the viability of neuronal cells treated with OGD/R while decreasing LDH release, oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, and apoptosis. Furthermore, these effects were abolished by knockdown of exosomal KLF4. KLF4 increased lncRNA-ZFAS1 through binding to its promoter. LncRNA-ZFAS1 overexpression suppressed the m6A levels of Drp1 and reversed the promoting effect of exosomal KLF4 silencing on mitochondrial injury and the imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics by targeting FTO. Exosomal KLF4 alleviated the infarct area, neuronal injury, and apoptosis in MCAO mice through lncRNA-ZFAS1/FTO/Drp1 axis. BMSC-derived exosomal KLF4 promoted lncRNA-ZFAS1 expression to repress Drp1 m6A modification by targeting FTO, thus reducing mitochondrial dysfunction and alleviating neuronal injury in ischemic stroke.","['Drp1', 'Exosomes', 'FTO', 'Ischemic stroke', 'KLF4', 'lncRNA-ZFAS1']",2022-04-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37002474,Neuromonitoring after Pediatric Cardiac Arrest: Cerebral Physiology and Injury Stratification.,"Significant long-term neurologic disability occurs in survivors of pediatric cardiac arrest, primarily due to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Postresuscitation care focuses on preventing secondary injury and the pathophysiologic cascade that leads to neuronal cell death. These injury processes include reperfusion injury, perturbations in cerebral blood flow, disturbed oxygen metabolism, impaired autoregulation, cerebral edema, and hyperthermia. Postresuscitation care also focuses on early injury stratification to allow clinicians to identify patients who could benefit from neuroprotective interventions in clinical trials and enable targeted therapeutics.In this review, we provide an overview of postcardiac arrest pathophysiology, explore the role of neuromonitoring in understanding postcardiac arrest cerebral physiology, and summarize the evidence supporting the use of neuromonitoring devices to guide pediatric postcardiac arrest care. We provide an in-depth review of the neuromonitoring modalities that measure cerebral perfusion, oxygenation, and function, as well as neuroimaging, serum biomarkers, and the implications of targeted temperature management.For each modality, we provide an in-depth review of its impact on treatment, its ability to stratify hypoxic-ischemic brain injury severity, and its role in neuroprognostication.Potential therapeutic targets and future directions are discussed, with the hope that multimodality monitoring can shift postarrest care from a one-size-fits-all model to an individualized model that uses cerebrovascular physiology to reduce secondary brain injury, increase accuracy of neuroprognostication, and improve outcomes.","['Brain injuries', 'Child', 'Heart arrest', 'Ischemia', 'Physiology']",2022-05-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37001384,Rosuvastatin promotes survival of random skin flaps through AMPK-mTOR pathway-induced autophagy.,"Plastic surgery frequently employs random skin flaps. However, its clinical applicability is constrained by flap necrosis brought on by ischemia-reperfusion damage. Flap survival is aided by rosuvastatin, a naturally occurring flavonoid primarily obtained from plants. In this research, we looked into the processes mediating the effects of rosuvastatin on flap survival. All experimental mice were randomly assigned to three groups: control, rosuvastatin, and 3-methyladenine (3MA) plus rosuvastatin. These groups were, respectively, treated with dimethyl sulfoxide solution, rosuvastatin, and rosuvastatin combined with 3MA. After that, the animals were euthanized so that histology and protein analyses could determine the extent of angiogenesis, pyroptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy. In addition to lessening tissue edema, rosuvastatin promoted the survival of the skin flap. Rosuvastatin also promoted angiogenesis, reduced oxidative stress, induced autophagy, and reduced pyroptosis. According to the study's findings, rosuvastatin increases angiogenesis, prevents pyroptosis, and reduces oxidative stress by inducing autophagy, which improves the survival rate of random skin flaps.","['Autophagy', 'Pyroptosis', 'Random skin flaps', 'Rosuvastatin']",2022-12-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37000981,Costunolide protects myocardium from ischemia reperfusion injury by inhibiting oxidative stress through Nrf2/Keap1 pathway activation.,"Costunolide (Cos) is a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone that exhibits antioxidative properties. In this study, we demonstrate the protective mechanism of Cos against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced myocardial injury. Cos significantly decreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ameliorated apoptosis of I/R cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation revealed that Cos increased expression of the antioxidant proteins HO-1 and NQO-1 and decreased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, thus protecting cardiac cells. NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) silencing significantly attenuated the protective effects of Cos in tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-treated H9C2 cells. Additionally, Cos significantly intensified the I/R- or TBHP-induced dissociation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) / Nrf2 complex both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that activation of Nrf2/Keap1 using Cos may be a therapeutic strategy for myocardial I/R injury.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37000151,Exosomal miR-370-3p increases the permeability of blood-brain barrier in ischemia/reperfusion stroke of brain by targeting MPK1.,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage induced by stroke poses a serious hazard to human life, while mechanism of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is still unknown. To imitate stroke induced ischemia conditions in vivo, the rat model of cerebral I/R damage was created by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In vitro, the rat microvascular endothelial cell line bEND.3 was subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Evans blue was used to evaluate the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To evaluate gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels, researchers used real-time PCR and western blotting. Infarct volume and BBB permeability were considerably higher in cerebral (I/R) animals than in the Sham group. Exosomal miR-370-3p expression was shown to be higher in the brains of I/R injured rats and OGD/R treatment bEND.3. The BBB permeability was considerably increased when miR-370-3p was downregulated in OGD/R pretreated bEND.3. miR-370-3p regulates MAPK1 expression by targeting it. In bEND.3, OGD/R therapy increased BBB permeability substantially. OGD/R was inhibited by miR-370-3p mimic transfection, while miR-370-3p mimic was abolished by co-transfection with MAPK1 overexpression lentivirus. In cerebral I/R damage, exosomal miR-370-3p targets MAPK1 and aggregates BBB permeability.","['blood-brain barrier', 'exosomes', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'mir-370-3p', 'stroke']",2022-10-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
37000116,Ubiquitin-specific protease 11 Aggravates Ischemia-reperfusion-induced Cardiomyocyte Pyroptosis and Injury by Promoting TRAF3 Deubiquitination.,"In myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, myocardial damage is aggravated when blood perfusion is restored in myocardial infarction. Ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11), a deubiquitinating enzyme, could remove the ubiquitination of substrate proteins and regulate protein stability, thereby affecting multiple pathological processes.To investigate the potential function of USP11 in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and its underlying mechanisms.In vivo and in vitro experimental study.The ischemia-reperfusion rat model in vivo was evolved, wherein the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 30 min, followed by ligature release for 120 min. Meanwhile, H9C2 cells were brought to hypoxia for 6 h and then reoxygenated for 18 h to establish a cell hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury in vitro. Then, the loss-of-function experiments of USP11 were performed. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to observe myocardial injury. The MTT assay was utilized to detect H9C2 cell viability. Pyroptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and flow cytometry. Pyroptosis-related protein expression and TRAF3 were analyzed via Western blot. The content of inflammatory factors was examined by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were performed to analyze for USP11 interacting with TRAF3.USP11 was upregulated in the ischemic heart tissue. Ischemia-reperfusion and H/R injuries increased USP11 expression. USP11 loss-of-function assays showed that USP11 knockdown alleviated ischemia-reperfusion- and H/R-induced myocardial cell damage, pyroptosis, pro-inflammatory factor secretion, and IKKβ/NF-κB pathway activation. In H9C2 cells, USP11 stabilized TRAF3 by deubiquitination. Furthermore, rescue experiments revealed that TRAF3 overexpression reversed the protection of silencing USP11 on H/R-induced H9C2 cell injury.This study confirmed that USP11 knockdown ameliorated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by downregulating TRAF3, suggesting that USP11 silencing can be a novel target of myocardial infarction.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36999410,Direct Transfer to the Neuroangiography Suite for Patients With Stroke.,"The therapeutic focus in acute ischemic stroke over the last 2.5 decades has been to balance the benefits of rapid reperfusion therapy with the risks of treatment-related complications. Both intravenous thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy are proven to substantially improve outcomes in a time-dependent manner. Each minute saved in achieving successful reperfusion grants an additional week of healthy life and may salvage up to 27 million neurons. The current approach to patient triage is inherited from the preendovascular thrombectomy era of stroke care. Current workflow concentrates on stabilization, diagnosis, and decision-making in the emergency department, followed by thrombolysis if eligible and subsequent transfer to the angiography suite as needed for further treatment. Multiple efforts have been directed toward minimizing the time from first medical contact to reperfusion therapy including prehospital triage and intrahospital workflow. Novel approaches for stroke patient triage such as the direct to angio approach, (also referred to as One Stop Management) are currently in development. The concept was initially introduced as several single-center experiences. In this narrative review article, we will consider various definitions of direct to angio and its variants, discuss its rationale, review its safety and efficacy, assess its feasibility, and delineate its limitations. Further, we will address methods to overcome these limitations and the potential impact of emerging data and new technologies on the direct-to-angio approach.","['angiography', 'neurons', 'reperfusion', 'stroke', 'thrombectomy', 'workflow']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36998131,Valsartan Protects in High Fat Diet During Ischemic Reperfusion Injury.,"The study investigates the effect of Valsartan, an Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), on the blunted neuroprotective response of ischemic post-conditioning (iPoCo) in rats subjected to High Fat Diet (HFD).The neuroprotective response of iPoCo is blunted in conditions of vascular endothelial dysfunction (ED) associated with hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hypertension, etc. Objectives: The study was undertaken to investigate the effect of Valsartan, an ARB, on the blunted neuroprotective response of iPoCo in rats subjected to HFD.Wistar rats were subjected to HFD for 56 days. The cerebral ischemic injury was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) for 12 min followed by reperfusion of 24 hrs. iPoCo was induced by three preceding cycles of ischemia and reperfusion lasting 1 min each given immediately after BCCAO at the onset of prolonged reperfusion. The extent of the injury was assessed in terms of memory impairment using the Morris Water Maze test (MWM), sensorimotor disturbance using the neurological severity score (NSS), and cerebral infarct size using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Series of biochemical estimations including brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS); reduced glutathione (GSH); myeloperoxidase (MPO); tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α); Nrf-2 and serum cholesterol, serum nitrite levels were performed.BCCAO produced significant cerebral injury indicated by increased cerebral infarct size, memory impairment, increased NSS, and various biochemical alterations (increased cholesterol, TBARS, MPO, TNF-α, Nrf-2, and decreased nitrite and GSH levels). Significant neutrophil infiltration was also observed. iPoCo attenuated BCCAO-induced injury with respect to the above parameters in normal rats. The protective response of iPoCo was lost in HFD-treated rats. Treatment of Valsartan attenuated cerebral injury, potentiated the neuroprotective response of iPoCo in normal rats, and also restored the blunted neuroprotective effect of iPoCo in HFD-treated rats along with enhanced Nrf-2 levels.Valsartan exerted a neuroprotective effect by virtue of its multiple actions with a crucial role in Nrf2 activation.","['BCCAO', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'High fat diet', 'Ischemic postconditioning', 'Valsartan']",2022-11-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36998077,Characterization of prehospital time delay in primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction: analysis of geographical infrastructure-dependent and -independent components.,"Prehospital delay in reaching a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facility is a major problem preventing early coronary reperfusion in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to identify modifiable factors that contribute to the interval from symptom onset to arrival at a PCI-capable center with a focus on geographical infrastructure-dependent and -independent factors.We analyzed data from 603 STEMI patients who received primary PCI within 12 h of symptom onset in the Hokkaido Acute Coronary Care Survey. We defined onset-to-door time (ODT) as the interval from the onset of symptoms to arrival at the PCI facility and we defined door-to-balloon time (DBT) as the interval from arrival at the PCI facility to PCI. We analyzed the characteristics and factors of each time interval by type of transportation to PCI facilities. In addition, we used geographical information system software to calculate the minimum prehospital system time (min-PST), which represents the time required to reach a PCI facility based on geographical factors. We then subtracted min-PST from ODT to find the estimated delay-in-arrival-to-door (eDAD), which represents the time required to reach a PCI facility independent of geographical factors. We investigated the factors related to the prolongation of eDAD.DBT (median [IQR]: 63 [44, 90] min) was shorter than ODT (median [IQR]: 104 [56, 204] min) regardless of the type of transportation. However, ODT was more than 120 min in 44% of the patients. The min-PST (median [IQR]: 3.7 [2.2, 12.0] min) varied widely among patients, with a maximum of 156 min. Prolongation of eDAD (median [IQR]: 89.1 [49, 180] min) was associated with older age, absence of a witness, onset at night, no emergency medical services (EMS) call, and transfer via a non-PCI facility. If eDAD was zero, ODT was projected to be less than 120 min in more than 90% of the patients.The contribution of geographical infrastructure-dependent time in prehospital delay was substantially smaller than that of geographical infrastructure-independent time. Intervention to shorten eDAD by focusing on factors such as older age, absence of a witness, onset at night, no EMS call, and transfer via a non-PCI facility appears to be an important strategy for reducing ODT in STEMI patients. Additionally, eDAD may be useful for evaluating the quality of STEMI patient transport in areas with different geographical conditions.","['Estimated delay-in-arrival-to-door (eDAD)', 'Geographical infrastructure', 'Health care systems', 'Minimum prehospital system time (min-PST)', 'Onset-to-door time (ODT)', 'Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)', 'Prehospital delay', 'ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)']",2023-01-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36997049,Hydrogen peroxide preconditioning is of dual role in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion.,"Moderate reactive oxygen species (ROS) at reperfusion would trigger cardioprotection and various antioxidants for pharmacological preconditioning failed to achieve cardioprotection. The causes for different roles of preischemic ROS during cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) require reevaluation. We investigated the precise role of ROS and its working model in this study. Different doses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, the most stable form of ROS) were added 5 min before ischemia using isolated perfused rat hearts, only moderate-dose H2O2 preconditioning (H2O2PC) achieved contractile recovery, whereas the low dose and high dose led to injury. Similar results were observed in isolated rat cardiomyocytes on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) overload, ROS production, the recovery of Ca2+ transient, and cell shortening. Based on the data mentioned above, we set up a mathematics model to describe the effects of H2O2PC with the fitting curve by the percentage of recovery of heart function and Ca2+ transient in I/R. Besides, we used the two models to define the initial thresholds of H2O2PC achieving cardioprotection. We also detected the expression of redox enzymes and Ca2+ signaling toolkits to explain the mathematics models of H2O2PC in a biological way. The expression of tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT3, Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2, manganese superoxide dismutase, phospholamban, catalase, ryanodine receptors, and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 were similar with the control I/R and low-dose H2O2PC but were increased in the moderate H2O2PC and decreased in the high-dose H2O2PC. Thus, we concluded that preischemic ROS are of dual role in cardiac I/R.","['Ca(2+) signaling toolkits', 'Cardioprotection', 'Hydrogen peroxide preconditioning', 'Redox enzymes', 'Threshold']",2022-12-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36996910,Targeting neuro-immune systems to achieve cardiac tissue repair following myocardial infarction: A review of therapeutic approaches from in-vivo preclinical to clinical studies.,"Myocardial healing following myocardial infarction (MI) toward either functional tissue repair or excessive scarring/heart failure, may depend on a complex interplay between nervous and immune system responses, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury factors, as well as genetic and epidemiological factors. Hence, enhancing cardiac repair post MI may require a more patient-specific approach targeting this complex interplay and not just the heart, bearing in mind that the dysregulation or modulation of just one of these systems or some of their mechanisms may determine the outcome either toward functional repair or toward heart failure. In this review we have elected to focus on existing preclinical and clinical in-vivo studies aimed at testing novel therapeutic approaches targeting the nervous and immune systems to trigger myocardial healing toward functional tissue repair. To this end, we have only selected clinical and preclinical in-vivo studies reporting on novel treatments targeting neuro-immune systems to ultimately treat MI. Next, we have grouped and reported treatments under each neuro-immune system. Finally, for each treatment we have assessed and reported the results of each clinical/preclinical study and then discussed their results collectively. This structured approach has been followed for each treatment discussed. To keep this review focused, we have deliberately omitted to cover other important and related research areas such as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, cell and gene therapies as well as any ex-vivo and in-vitro studies. The review indicates that some of the treatments targeting the neuro-immune/inflammatory systems appear to induce beneficial effects remotely on the healing heart post MI, warranting further validation. These remote effects on the heart also indicates the presence of an overarching synergic response occurring across the nervous and immune systems in response to acute MI, which appear to influence cardiac tissue repair in different ways depending on age and timing of treatment delivery following MI. The cumulative evidence arising from this review allows also to make informed considerations on safe as opposed to detrimental treatments, and within the safe treatments to ascertain those associated with conflicting or supporting preclinical data, and those warranting further validation.","['Cardiac repair', 'Ischemic heart failure', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Neuro-immune response', 'Therapeutic approaches']",2022-11-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36996742,C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-9 exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-stimulated neurons by modulating the Akt-GSK-3β-Nrf2 cascade via AdipoR1.,"C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-9 (CTRP9) is linked to diverse pathological conditions via the effects on cell apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. However, its functional relevance in ischemic brain injury is not well determined. The present work aimed to evaluate the role of CTRP9 in ischemia/reperfusion-associated neuronal injury using an in vitro model. The cultured cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate ischemia/reperfusion in vitro. CTRP9 level was lowered in cultured neurons exposed to OGD/R. Neurons with overexpressed CTRP9 were resistant to OGD/R-elicited injuries, including neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory response. Mechanism research revealed that CTRP9 could boost the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway associated with modulation of the Akt-glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) axis. CTRP9 regulated the transduction of the Akt-GSK-3β-Nrf2 cascade via adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1). Restraining Nrf2 could diminish CTRP9-mediated neuroprotective effects in OGD/R-injured neurons. Altogether, these results confirmed that CTRP9 exerts a protective effect on OGD/R-injured neurons by modulating Akt-GSK-3β-Nrf2 cascade via AdipoR1. This work suggests a possible link between CTRP9 and ischemic brain injury.","['CTRP9', 'Inflammation', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative stress', 'Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation']",2022-11-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36996739,Astrocytes-derived exosomes pre-treated by berberine inhibit neuroinflammation after stroke via miR-182-5p/Rac1 pathway.,"Our previous studies have shown that berberine can improve the nerve function deficits in ischemic stroke by inhibiting inflammation. The cellular communication between astrocytes and neurons via exosomes might affect neurological function after ischemic stroke, which plays a vital role in the therapy of ischemic stroke.The present study focused on the effects of exosomes released from astrocytes induced by the glucose and oxygen deprivation model with berberine pretreatment (BBR-exos) treatment for ischemic stroke and its regulatory mechanism.Oxygen-glucose-deprivation/Reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated primary cells were used to mimic cerebral ischemia/reperfusion conditions in vitro. With the treatment of BBR-exos and exosomes released from primary astrocytes induced by the glucose and oxygen deprivation model (OGD/R-exos), the cell viability was detected. C57BL/6J mice were used to establish middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. The anti-neuroinflammation effects of BBR-exos and OGD/R-exos were evaluated. Subsequently, the key miRNA in BBR-exos was identified by exosomal miRNA sequencing and cell validation. miR-182-5p mimic and inhibitors were provided to verify the effects in inflammation. Finally, the binding sites between miR-182-5p and Rac1 were predicted online and verified by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay.BBR-exos and OGD/R-exos both improved the decreased activity of OGD/R-induced neurons, and decreased the expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (all P ＜ 0.05), which reduced neuronal injury and inhibited neuroinflammation in Vitro. And BBR-exos showed better effects (P ＜ 0.05). The same effect has been verified in vivo experiments: BBR-exos and OGD/R-exos both reduced cerebral ischemic injury and inhibited neuroinflammation in MCAO/R mice (all P ＜ 0.05). Likewise, BBR-exos showed better effects (P ＜ 0.05). The exosomal miRNA sequencing results showed that miR-182-5p was highly expressed in BBR-exos and inhibited neuroinflammation by targeting Rac1 (P ＜ 0.05).BBR-exos can carry miR-182-5p to injured neurons and inhibit the expression of Rac1, which could inhibit neuroinflammation and improved brain injury after ischemic stroke.","['Astrocytes', 'Berberine', 'Exosomes', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemic stroke', 'miRNA']",2022-10-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36996692,Curcumin protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation: A meta-analysis and mechanism exploration.,"Accumulating evidence has suggested that curcumin may protect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, biological mechanisms vary across studies, limiting the clinical applicability of these findings. We performed a meta-analysis on publications evaluating curcumin administration in rat models of CIRI. Furthermore, we sought to test the hypothesis that curcumin alleviates CIRI through diminishing oxidation and inflammation. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane from the starting date of each database to May 2022 for experimental rat studies exploring the use of curcumin after ischemia reperfusion. Included articles were assessed for bias using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Data were aggregated by a random effects model. Curcumin administration significantly reduced neurological deficit score (20 studies; pooled mean difference [MD] = -1.57; 95% CI, -1.78 to -1.36, P < .00001), infarct volume (18 studies; pooled MD = -17.56%; 95% CI, -20.92% to -14.20%; P < 0.00001), and brain water content (8 studies, pooled MD = -11.29%, 95% CI: -16.48%, -6.11%, P < .00001). Compared with control, the levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase were significantly higher, whereas the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and nuclear factor kappa B were significantly lower (P < .05). Subgroup analysis raised the possibility that intervention affections differed by curcumin's dose. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of curcumin's neuroprotection and mechanisms in rat CIRI models. Our analysis suggests the neuroprotective potential of curcumin in CIRI via antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory effect. More research is required to further confirm the effectiveness and safety of curcumin on ischemic stroke therapy.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Curcumin', 'Inflammation', 'Meta-analysis', 'Neuroprotective effects', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-09-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, the role of EA on sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction has rarely been elucidated before. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of EA on cardiac dysfunction in a rat model of sepsis and to speculate the underlying mechanisms.Sepsis was induced by cecum ligation and puncture in anesthetized rats. EA at the acupoint ""Neiguan (PC6)"" was applied 0.5 h after the induction of sepsis for 20 min. Heart rate variability was obtained immediately after EA to evaluate autonomic balance. Echocardiography was performed at 6 h and 24 h after sepsis induction in vivo. Measurements of hemodynamics, blood gases, cytokines and biochemistry were collected at 24 h. Cardiac tissue underwent immunofluorescence staining to determine the expression of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on macrophages.EA increased vagus nerve activity, prevented the development of hyperlactatemia, attenuated the decline of left ventricle ejection fraction, suppressed systemic and cardiac inflammation and alleviated the histopathological manifestations of heart in sepsis rats. Furthermore, the cardiac tissue from EA treated rats showed increased expressions of α7nAChR on macrophages. The cardio-protective and anti-inflammatory effects of EA were partly or completely prevented in rats with vagotomy.EA at PC6 attenuates left ventricle dysfunction and decreases inflammation in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction.

36996446,Retinal Ischemia Following Focal Cerebral Arteriopathy in a Young Girl.,"We present a case of an ischemic retinopathy with severe vision loss secondary to a childhood stroke.Case report.An otherwise healthy 9-year-old girl presented with a 1-day history of impaired gait and speech. After performing Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging, thrombosis of the left Internal Carotid Artery was observed and a diagnosis of ischemic stroke was established. Serological autoimmune, coagulation, and viral panels were unrewarding. Cardiac, inflammatory and coagulation disorders were ruled out. The cause was attributed to a Focal Cerebral Arteriopathy, a common cause of childhood stroke. The patient was treated with mechanical thrombectomy followed by anticoagulation. The day after, the patient referred vision loss of 20/100 in the left eye. Fundus evaluation of the left eye depicted diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages as well as cotton-wool spots and there was retinal whitening at the posterior pole. Six weeks after, visual acuity dropped to counting fingers.A macular optical coherence tomography revealed diffuse atrophic changes in the inner retinal layers at the macula, and the Angio-OCT showed an enlarged Foveal Avascular Zone. We propose ischemia-reperfusion as the primary explanation of this unusual event.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36995924,Pretreatment with a novel Toll-like receptor 4 agonist attenuates renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in surgical and critically ill patients. This study examined whether pretreatment with a novel Toll-like receptor 4 agonist attenuated ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)-induced AKI (IRI-AKI). We performed a blinded, randomized-controlled study in mice pretreated with 3-deacyl 6-acyl phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide (PHAD), a synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 agonist. Two cohorts of male BALB/c mice received intravenous vehicle or PHAD (2, 20, or 200 µg) at 48 and 24 h before unilateral renal pedicle clamping and simultaneous contralateral nephrectomy. A separate cohort of mice received intravenous vehicle or 200 µg PHAD followed by bilateral IRI-AKI. Mice were monitored for evidence of kidney injury for 3 days postreperfusion. Kidney function was assessed by serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine measurements. Kidney tubular injury was assessed by semiquantitative analysis of tubular morphology on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-stained kidney sections and by kidney mRNA quantification of injury [neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal), kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), and heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1)] and inflammation [interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (Tnf-α)] using quantitative RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to quantify proximal tubular cell injury and renal macrophages by quantifying the areas stained with Kim-1 and F4/80 antibodies, respectively, and TUNEL staining to detect the apoptotic nuclei. PHAD pretreatment yielded dose-dependent kidney function preservation after unilateral IRI-AKI. Histological injury, apoptosis, Kim-1 staining, and Ngal mRNA were lower in PHAD-treated mice and IL-1β mRNA was higher in PHAD-treated mice. Similar pretreatment protection was noted with 200 mg PHAD after bilateral IRI-AKI, with significantly reduced Kim-1 immunostaining in the outer medulla of mice treated with PHAD after bilateral IRI-AKI. In conclusion, PHAD pretreatment leads to dose-dependent protection from renal injury after unilateral and bilateral IRI-AKI in mice.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Pretreatment with 3-deacyl 6-acyl phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide; a novel synthetic Toll-like receptor 4 agonist, preserves kidney function during ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced acute kidney injury.","['3-deacyl 6-acyl phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide', 'Toll-like receptor 4 agonist', 'acute kidney injury', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'phosphorylated hexaacyl disaccharide']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36995087,Electron Transport Chain Inhibition to Decrease Reperfusion Injury in Transplanted Donation after Circulatory Death Rat Hearts.,"Donation after circulatory death (DCD) donor hearts sustain ischemic damage and are not routinely utilized for heart transplantation. DCD heart injury, particularly reperfusion injury, is primarily mediated by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the damaged mitochondria (complex I of the electron transport chain). Amobarbital (AMO) is a transient inhibitor of complex I and is known to reduce ROS generation. We studied the beneficial effects of AMO in transplanted DCD hearts. Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to four groups- DCD or DCD+AMO donors and control beating-heart donors (CBD) or CBD+AMO donors (n=6-8 each). Anesthetized rats were connected to a ventilator. The right carotid artery was cannulated, heparin and vecuronium were administered. The DCD process started by disconnecting the ventilator. DCD hearts were procured following 25 minutes ofin-vivoischemia, while CBD hearts were procured without ischemia. At procurement, all donor hearts received 10ml of University of Wisconsin cardioplegia solution. The CBD+AMO and DCD+AMO groups received AMO (2 mM) dissolved in cardioplegia. Heterotopic heart transplantation was performed by anastomosing the donor aorta and pulmonary artery to the recipient's abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava. Following 14 days, transplanted heart function was measured with a balloon tip catheter placed in the left ventricle. Compared to CBD hearts, DCD hearts had significantly lower developed pressure. AMO treatment significantly improved cardiac function in DCD hearts. Treatment of DCD hearts at the time of reperfusion with AMO resulted in an improvement of transplanted heart function that was comparable to the CBD hearts.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36993974,Multifaceted involvements of Paneth cells in various diseases within intestine and systemically.,"Serving as the guardians of small intestine, Paneth cells (PCs) play an important role in intestinal homeostasis maintenance. Although PCs uniquely exist in intestine under homeostasis, the dysfunction of PCs is involved in various diseases not only in intestine but also in extraintestinal organs, suggesting the systemic importance of PCs. The mechanisms under the participation of PCs in these diseases are multiple as well. The involvements of PCs are mostly characterized by limiting intestinal bacterial translocation in necrotizing enterocolitis, liver disease, acute pancreatitis and graft-vs-host disease. Risk genes in PCs render intestine susceptible to Crohn's disease. In intestinal infection, different pathogens induce varied responses in PCs, and toll-like receptor ligands on bacterial surface trigger the degranulation of PCs. The increased level of bile acid dramatically impairs PCs in obesity. PCs can inhibit virus entry and promote intestinal regeneration to alleviate COVID-19. On the contrary, abundant IL-17A in PCs aggravates multi-organ injury in ischemia/reperfusion. The pro-angiogenic effect of PCs aggravates the severity of portal hypertension. Therapeutic strategies targeting PCs mainly include PC protection, PC-derived inflammatory cytokine elimination, and substituting AMP treatment. In this review, we discuss the influence and importance of Paneth cells in both intestinal and extraintestinal diseases as reported so far, as well as the potential therapeutic strategies targeting PCs.","['COVID-19', 'Crohn’s disease', 'Paneth cell', 'acute pancreatitis', 'liver disease', 'necrotizing enterocolitis', 'therapeutic strategy']",2022-12-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36993800,Deletion of NADPH oxidase 2 attenuates cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury through reducing ROS-induced proximal tubular cell injury and inflammation.,"Cisplatin is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment. However, its high nephrotoxicity limits its therapeutic application and efficacy. Cisplatin induces nephrotoxicity mainly through oxidative stress and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the kidneys mainly arise from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases 2 (NOX2), which is highly upregulated during ischemia-reperfusion injury and diabetes mellitus. However, its role in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unknown.A 8-10-week-old NOX2 gene-knockout and wild-type mice were injected with 25 mg/kg cisplatin intraperitoneally for experiments.We investigated the role of NOX2 in cisplatin-induced AKI and found that NOX2-mediated ROS production is a key inflammatory mediator of proximal tubular cell injury in cisplatin-induced AKI. NOX2 gene-knockout alleviated cisplatin-induced renal function decline, tubular injury score, kidney injury molecule-1(Kim-1) expression, and interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1α levels with a reduction of ROS production. Moreover, in cisplatin-induced AKI, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and the chemoattractant CXC ligand 1 (CXCL1) were highly expressed in association with neutrophil infiltration, which were all attenuated by deletion of NOX2.These data indicate that NOX2 aggravates cisplatin nephrotoxicity by promoting ROS-mediated tissue injury and neutrophil infiltration. Thus, appropriate targeting of NOX2/ROS pathway may minimize the risk of cisplatin-induced kidney injury in patients receiving cancer therapy.","['ICAM-1 NOX2 modulates cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity', 'NOX2', 'ROS', 'cisplatin-induced AKI', 'neutrophil infiltration']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36993301,Real-time in vivo thoracic spinal glutamate sensing reveals spinal hyperactivity during myocardial ischemia.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) can cause ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death via sympathoexcitation. The spinal cord neural network is crucial in triggering these arrhythmias and evaluating its neurotransmitter activity during IR is critical for understanding ventricular excitability control. To assess the real-time in vivo spinal neural activity in a large animal model, we developed a flexible glutamate-sensing multielectrode array. To record the glutamate signaling during IR injury, we inserted the probe into the dorsal horn of the thoracic spinal cord at the T2-T3 where neural signals generated by the cardiac sensory neurons are processed and provide sympathoexcitatory feedback to the heart. Using the glutamate sensing probe, we found that the spinal neural network was excited during IR, especially after 15 mins, and remained elevated during reperfusion. Higher glutamate signaling was correlated with the reduction in the cardiac myocyte activation recovery interval, showing higher sympathoexcitation, as well as dispersion of the repolarization which is a marker for increased risk of arrhythmias. This study illustrates a new technique for measuring the spinal glutamate at different spinal cord levels as a surrogate for the spinal neural network activity during cardiac interventions that engage the cardio-spinal neural pathway.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36992598,Predictors of Early Neurological Deterioration Occurring within 24 h in Acute Ischemic Stroke following Reperfusion Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Early neurological deterioration (END), generally defined as the increment of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥4 within 24 hours, lead to poor clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients receiving reperfusion therapies including intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or endovascular treatment (EVT). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore multiple predictors of END following reperfusion therapies.We searched PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCO for all studies on END in AIS patients receiving IVT and/or EVT published between January 2000 and December 2022. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The quality of each included studies was assessed by calculating a total score according to the STROBE or CONSORT criteria. Publication bias and heterogeneity were also evaluated using the Eggers/Peters test, funnel plots and sensitivity analysis.A total of 29 studies involving 65,960 AIS patients were included. The quality of evidence is moderate to high, and all studies have no publication bias. The overall incidence of END occurring after reperfusion therapy in AIS patients was 14% ((95% confidence intervals (CI), 12%-15%)). Age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), glucose levels at admission, the onset to treatment time (OTT), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, arterial fibrillation, and internal cerebral artery occlusion were significantly associated with END following reperfusion therapy.Numerous factors are associated with END occurrence in AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy. Management of the risk factors of END may improve the functional outcome after reperfusion treatment.","['early neurological deterioration (END)', 'endovascular treatment (EVT)', 'intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)', 'predictors', 'reperfusion therapy']",2022-11-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Pycnogenol® (PYC), a standardized extract of French maritime pine tree (Pinus pinaster Aiton) has been exploited as an additive for dietary supplement. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of post-treatment with PYC and its therapeutic mechanisms in gerbils.The gerbils were given sham and IR operation and intraperitoneally injected with vehicle and Pycnogenol® (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively) immediately, at 24 hours and 48 hours after sham and IR operation. Through 8-arm radial maze test and passive avoidance test, each spatial memory and short-term memory function was assessed. To examine the neuroprotection of Pycnogenol®, we conducted cresyl violet staining, immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei, and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence. Moreover, we carried out immunohistochemistry for immunoglobulin G (IgG) to investigate blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) to examine change in pro-inflammatory cytokine.We found that IR-induced memory deficits were significantly ameliorated when 100 mg/kg Pycnogenol® was treated. In addition, treatment with 100 mg/kg Pycnogenol®, not 25 mg/kg nor 50 mg/kg, conferred neuroprotective effect against IR injury. For its mechanisms, we found that 100 mg/kg Pycnogenol® significantly reduced BBB leakage and inhibited the expression of IL-1β.Therapeutic treatment (post-treatment) with Pycnogenol® after IR effectively attenuated ischemic brain injury in gerbils. Based on these results, we suggest that PYC can be employed as an important material for ischemic drugs.","['immunoglobulin G', 'neuroprotection', 'proinflammatory cytokines', 'pyramidal cell', 'transient forebrain ischemia']",2022-10-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36991356,HOTAIR regulates SIRT3-mediated cardiomyocyte survival after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion by interacting with FUS.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) contributes to serious myocardial injury and even death. Therefore, prevention and mitigation of myocardial I/R is particularly important. LncRNA HOTAIR has been reported to be implicated in myocardial I/R progression. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of HOTAIR in cardiomyocyte was explored in myocardial I/R.Firstly, cell model of myocardial I/R was established through hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated utilizing flow cytometry. The corresponding test kits were conducted to monitor the levels of LDH, Caspase3 and Caspase9. The gene expression and protein levels were detected by qPCR and western blot, respectively. RNA pull-down and RIP were performed to verify the interaction between FUS and lncRNA HOTAIR.In AC16 cardiomyocytes treated with H/R, lncRNA HOTAIR and SIRT3 expression were obviously decreased. Overexpression of HOTAIR or SIRT3 could ameliorate H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury by promoting cell viability, lowering LDH levels, and suppressing cell apoptosis. Further, lncRNA HOTAIR upregulated the expression of SIRT3 via interacting with FUS, thereby promoting the survival of H/R-injured cardiomyocytes.LncRNA HOTAIR can improve myocardial I/R by affecting cardiomyocyte survival through regulation of SIRT3 by binding to the RNA binding protein FUS.","['Cardiomyocyte survival', 'FUS', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'SIRT3', 'lncRNA HOTAIR']",2022-10-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Whether outcomes differ depending on the type of imaging selection is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes between CTP and NCCT for EVT selection in the late therapeutic window.This study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 2020 guidelines. A systematic literature review of the English language literature was conducted using Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and PubMed databases. Studies focusing on late-window AIS undergoing EVT imaged through CTP and NCCT were included. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcome of interest was rate of functional independence, defined as modified Rankin scale 0-2. The secondary outcomes of interest included rates of successful reperfusion, defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b-3, mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).Five studies with 3,384 patients were included in our analysis. There were comparable rates of functional independence (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% CI 0.87-1.22; p = 0.71) and sICH (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.58-2.04; p = 0.80) between the 2 groups. Patients imaged with CTP had higher rates of successful reperfusion (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.64; p = 0.015) and lower rates of mortality (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.96; p = 0.017).Although recovery of functional independence after late-window EVT was not more common in patients selected by CTP when compared with patients selected by NCCT only, patients selected by CTP had lower mortality.",[],2022-11-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36990710,[Attention should be paid to futile recanalization after endovascular treatment in acute ischemic stroke].,"With the accumulation of research evidence and clinical experience, an increasing number of patients benefit from vascular recanalization therapies. Although successful recanalization of the occluded artery has been achieved, neurological deficits persist after endovascular treatment, which defined as""futile reperfusion"". Compared with the successful recanalization, successful reperfusion predicts final infarct size and clinical outcome more accurately. At present, the known influencing factors of futile reperfusion include older age, female, high baseline National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, reperfusion treatment strategy, large infarction core volume, and collateral circulation status. The incidence of futile reperfusion in China is significantly higher than that in western population. However, few studies focused on its mechanism and influencing factors. To date, many clinical studies have attempted to reduce the occurrence of futile recanalization regarding antiplatelet therapy, blood pressure management and treatment process improvement. However, only one effective measure has been achieved in blood pressure management: systolic blood pressure control below 120 mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) should be avoided after successful recanalization. Therefore, future studies are warranted to promote the establishment and maintenance of collateral circulation, as well as neuroprotective therapy.近年来，由于临床研究证据和临床经验的积累，越来越多的急性卒中患者从血管开通治疗中获益，但同时存在“无效再通”现象，即血管成功开通，但神经功能并不恢复。相比于血管成功开通，成功的再灌注可以更准确地预测患者最终梗死体积及临床结局。目前已知有关无效再通的影响因素主要包括高龄、女性、较高的基线美国国立卫生研究院卒中量表（NIHSS）评分、高血压、糖尿病、心房纤颤等因素，以及再灌注治疗策略，大梗死核心体积以及侧支循环状态。我国卒中人群无效再通的发生率显著高于西方人群，然而有关其机制及影响因素的研究仍较少。目前已有许多大型临床研究在抗血小板治疗方案、血压管理、治疗流程改进等方面试图探索减少无效再通的发生，然而仅在血压管理方面发现有效措施：血管成功开通后应避免将收缩压控制在120 mmHg（1 mmHg=0.133 kPa）以下。未来需要在促进侧支循环的建立及维持、联合神经保护治疗等方面进一步探索。.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36990422,LncRNA JPX targets SERCA2a to mitigate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by binding to EZH2.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pivotal regulators in heart disease, including myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. LncRNA just proximal to XIST (JPX) is a molecular switch for X-chromosome inactivation. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a core catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in chromatin compaction and gene repression. This study aims to explore the mechanism of JPX regulating the expression of Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) by binding to EZH2 and preventing cardiomyocyte I/R damage in vivo and in vitro. First, we constructed mouse myocardial I/R and HL1 cell hypoxia/reoxygenation models, and found that JPX was low expressed in both models. JPX overexpression alleviated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, reduced the I/R-induced infarct size in mouse hearts, lowered the serum cTnI concentration, and promoted mouse cardiac systolic function. The evidence implies that JPX can alleviate I/R-induced acute cardiac damage. Mechanistically, the FISH and RIP assays showed that JPX could bind to EZH2. The ChIP assay revealed EZH2 enrichment at the promoter region of SERCA2a. Both the EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels at the promoter region of SERCA2a were reduced in the JPX overexpression group compared to those in the Ad-EGFP group (P < 0.01). In summary, our results suggested that LncRNA JPX directly bound to EZH2 and reduced the EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 in the SERCA2a promoter region, protecting the heart from acute myocardial I/R injury. Therefore, JPX might be a potential therapeutic target for I/R injury.","['EZH2', 'JPX', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'SERCA2a', 'lncRNA']",2022-10-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36990325,Remote ischemic postconditioning ameliorates stroke injury via the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling axis in rats.,"Remote Ischemic Postconditioning (RIPostC) has become a research hotspot due to its protective effect on the brain in clinical studies related to ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of RIPostC after ischemic stroke in rats. The middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established by the wire embolization method. RIPostC was obtained by inducing temporary ischemia in the hind limbs of rats. First, based on the results of short-term behavioral measures and long-term neurological function experiments, RIPostC was found to have a protective effect on the MCAO/R model and to improve neurological recovery in rats. Compared to the sham group, RIPostC upregulated the expression levels of C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4(CXCR4) in the brain and stromal cell-derived factor-1(SDF-1α) in peripheral blood. In addition, RIPostC upregulated CXCR4 expression on CD34 + stem cells in peripheral blood in flow cytometric assays. Meanwhile, according to the results of EdU/DCX co-staining and CD31 staining, it was found that the effect of RIPostC on ameliorating brain injury via SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling axis may be associated with vascular neogenesis. Finally, after inhibiting the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling axis using AMD3100(Plerixafor), we found that the neuroprotective effect of RIPostC was diminished. Taken together, RIPostC can improve neurobehavioral damage induced by MCAO/R in rats, and its mechanism may be related to SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling axis. Therefore, RIPostC can be used as an intervention strategy for stroke. SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling axis can also be a potential target for intervention.","['Angiogenesis', 'CXCR4', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Neurogenesis', 'Remote ischemic postconditioning', 'SDF-1α']",2022-12-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36990128,Downregulation of fatty acid oxidation led by Hilpda increases G2/M arrest/delay-induced kidney fibrosis.,"Hypoxia-regulated proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTCs) G2/M phase arrest/delay was involved in production of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF). TIF is a common pathological manifestation of progression in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and is often accompanied by lipid accumulation in renal tubules. However, cause-effect relationship between hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated protein (Hilpda), lipid accumulation, G2/M phase arrest/delay and TIF remains unclear. Here we found that overexpression of Hilpda downregulated adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) promoted triglyceride overload in the form of lipid accumulation, leading to defective fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), ATP depletion in a human PTC cell line (HK-2) under hypoxia and in mice kidney tissue treated with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI). Hilpda-induced lipid accumulation caused mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced expression of profibrogenic factors TGF-β1, α-SMA and Collagen I elevation, and reduced expression of G2/M phase-associated gene CDK1, as well as increased CyclinB1/D1 ratio, resulted in G2/M phase arrest/delay and profibrogenic phenotypes. Hilpda deficiency in HK-2 cell and kidney of mice with UUO had sustained expression of ATGL and CDK1 and reduced expression of TGF-β1, Collagen I and CyclinB1/D1 ratio, resulting in the amelioration of lipid accumulation and G2/M arrest/delay and subsequent TIF. Expression of Hilpda correlated with lipid accumulation, was positively associated with tubulointerstitial fibrosis in tissue samples from patients with CKD. Our findings suggest that Hilpda deranges fatty acid metabolism in PTCs, which leads to G2/M phase arrest/delay and upregulation of profibrogenic factors, and consequently promote TIF which possibly underlie pathogenesis of CKD.","['Fatty acid metabolism', 'G2/M phase arrest', 'Hilpda', 'Hypoxia', 'Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis']",2022-12-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

An optimal treatment strategy with considerations of stroke etiology has not yet been established. Here-in, we performed retrospective analysis of EVT for atherosclerotic AIS.Data from patients with AIS who underwent EVT between 2017 and 2022 were analyzed. Clinical characteristics, procedural data, and outcomes were assessed. Further analysis was conducted to elucidate the factors associated with clinical outcomes. And data of patients with poor clinical outcomes (mRS, 5 or 6) were evaluated further to determine the primary cause.Among 194 patients who received EVT, 40 (20.6%) were diagnosed with AIS with an atherosclerotic etiology. The rates of successful reperfusion (TICI 2b or 3) and good clinical outcomes (mRS, 0-2) were 95.0% and 45.0%, respectively. No procedure-related complications were noted. Older age (p = 0.007), more severe baseline NIHSS score (p = 0.004), lesion in the posterior circulation (p = 0.025), and recanalization failure (p = 0.027) were more frequently observed in patients with poor clinical outcomes. Brainstem infarction and postprocedural intracerebral hemorrhage were the main reasons for poor clinical outcomes.The EVT for atherosclerotic AIS were effective and safe. Older age, more severe NIHSS score, lesions in the posterior circulation, and recanalization failure were the factors associated with poor clinical outcomes. It is important to recognize that these factors may aggravate the clinical response to this promising therapy, even in patient successful recanalization was attained.","['Acute ischemic stroke', 'Angioplasty', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Endovascular therapy', 'Intracranial artery stenosis', 'Mechanical thrombectomy', 'Stentin']",2023-01-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36989330,"Profiles of lipid, protein and microRNA expression in exosomes derived from intestinal epithelial cells after ischemia-reperfusion injury in a cellular hypoxia model.","Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury leads to proinflammatory responses via gut-derived mediators, and accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes secreted by intestinal epithelial cells are involved in the development of systemic inflammation. Studies have reported changes in protein, lipid, and microRNA (miRNA) expression; however, considering the different experimental conditions, information on the relationships among these biomolecules remains insufficient. The aim of this study was to elucidate the multiple changes that simultaneously occur in exosomes after ischemic stimulation. Here, differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells were exposed to 95% air (normoxia group) or 5% O2 (hypoxia group) for 6 h. Cells in each group were subsequently incubated for 24 h in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 plus 95% air. The conditioned medium of each group was collected for isolating intestinal epithelial cell-derived exosomes. Together with proteome analyses, lipid analyses, and miRNA quantification, biological functional assays were performed using monocytic NF-κB reporter cells. Lipid metabolism-related protein expression was upregulated, miRNA levels were slightly altered, and unsaturated fatty acid-containing lysophosphatidylcholine concentration increased after hypoxia and reoxygenation injury; this suggested that the changes in exosomal components associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury activates inflammation, including the NF-κB pathway.

Hirudin, an effective thrombin inhibitor, can offer protection against MIRI. This study aimed to determine if hirudin administration ameliorates HSR-induced MIRI and the underlying mechanism. A rat model of HSR was established by bleeding rats to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30-35 mmHg for 45 min and then resuscitating them with all the shed blood through the left femoral vein. After HSR, 1 mg/kg of hirudin was administrated immediately. At 24 h after HSR, the cardiac injury was assessed using serum CK-MB, cTnT, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, echocardiography, M1-polarized macrophages, and pyroptosis-associated factors, including cleaved caspase-1, Gasdermin D (GSDMD) N-terminal, IL-1β, and IL-18 were measured by immunofluorescence and western blot assays. Nigericin, a unique agonist, was utilized to evaluate the responsibilities of NLRP3 signaling. Under the HSR condition, rats exhibited a significant increase in myocardial injury score, an elevation of serum cTnT, CK-MB levels, an aggrandization of M1-polarized macrophages, an upregulation of pyroptosis-associated factors, including cleaved caspase-1, GSDMD N-terminal, IL-1β, and IL-18, but a significant decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (EF%) and a reduction of left ventricular fractional shortening (FS%), while hirudin administration partially restored the changes. However, the NLRP3 agonist nigericin reversed the cardioprotective effects of hirudin. We determined the cardioprotective effects of hirudin against HSR-induced MIRI. The mechanism may involve the inhibition of NLRP3-induced pyroptosis.","['Hemorrhage shock and resuscitation', 'Hirudin', 'Ischemia', 'NLRP3', 'Pyroptosis']",2023-02-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The MIRI mouse model was established and perfused with NAR before surgery. In the in vitro experiment, macrophages RAW264.7 were treated with lipopolysaccharide to induce M1 polarization after pretreatment with NAR. Rescue experiments were carried out to validate the functions of transcription factor EB (TFEB), the NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, and autophagy in macrophage polarization. NAR reduced histopathological injury and infarction of myocardial tissues in MIRI mice, inhibited M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization of macrophages, diminished levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and augmented levels of anti-inflammatory factors. NAR facilitated TFEB nuclear translocation and inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Silencing TFEB or Nigericin partly nullified the effect of NAR on macrophage polarization. NAR increased autophagosome formation, autophagy flux, and autophagy level. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine partly invalidated the inhibition of NAR on the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. In animal experiments, NAR protected MIRI mice through the TFEB-autophagy-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Collectively, NAR inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and facilitated M2 macrophage polarization by stimulating TFEB nuclear translocation, thus protecting against MIRI.","['M1 polarization', 'M2 polarization', 'NLRP3 inflammasome', 'Naringenin', 'TFEB', 'macrophage', 'myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'nuclear translocation']",2022-09-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36988254,Protective effects of cordycepin pretreatment against liver ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice.,"Cordycepin has been reported to exhibit hepatic protective and anti-inflammatory properties. Here, we investigated the role of cordycepin in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced liver injury in a mouse model.Mice were pretreated with cordycepin by gavage for 3 weeks, followed by the establishment of the IR modeling. Liver injury, Suzuki's histological grading, hepatic apoptosis, and inflammatory responses were evaluated by biochemical and pathological analysis.It was found that Cordycepin pretreatment at 50 mg/kg for 3 weeks attenuated IR-induced liver injury, as reflected by the significant decrease of the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, and low-density lipoprotein. Cordycepin pretreatment also reduced histopathological changes, attenuated hepatocyte apoptosis, inflammatory responses in the livers of IR mice. Mechanically, toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa-B signaling in liver tissues was inhibited by Cordycepin pretreatment.In conclusion, Cordycepin pretreatment protects IR-induced liver injury, which demonstrates its potential for the treatment of IR in the liver.","['TLR4/NF-κB signaling', 'apoptosis', 'cordycepin', 'inflammation', 'ischemia/reperfusion']",2022-11-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36987924,Alox15/15-HpETE Aggravates Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Promoting Cardiomyocyte Ferroptosis.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury causes cardiac dysfunction to myocardial cell loss and fibrosis. Prevention of cell death is important to protect cardiac function after I/R injury. The process of reperfusion can lead to multiple types of cardiomyocyte death, including necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis. However, the time point at which the various modes of cell death occur after reperfusion injury and the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis regulation in cardiomyocytes are still unclear.Using a left anterior descending coronary artery ligation mouse model, we sought to investigate the time point at which the various modes of cell death occur after reperfusion injury. To discover the key molecules involved in cardiomyocyte ferroptosis, we performed a metabolomics study. Loss/gain-of-function approaches were used to understand the role of 15-lipoxygenase (Alox15) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Pgc1α) in myocardial I/R injury.We found that apoptosis and necrosis occurred in the early phase of I/R injury, and that ferroptosis was the predominant form of cell death during the prolonged reperfusion. Metabolomic profiling of eicosanoids revealed that Alox15 metabolites accumulated in ferroptotic cardiomyocytes. We demonstrated that Alox15 expression was specifically increased in the injured area of the left ventricle below the suture and colocalized with cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, myocardial-specific knockout of Alox15 in mice alleviated I/R injury and restored cardiac function. 15-Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HpETE), an intermediate metabolite derived from arachidonic acid by Alox15, was identified as a trigger for cardiomyocyte ferroptosis. We explored the mechanism underlying its effects and found that 15-HpETE promoted the binding of Pgc1α to the ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 34, leading to its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Consequently, attenuated mitochondrial biogenesis and abnormal mitochondrial morphology were observed. ML351, a specific inhibitor of Alox15, increased the protein level of Pgc1α, inhibited cardiomyocyte ferroptosis, protected the injured myocardium, and caused cardiac function recovery.Together, our results established that Alox15/15-HpETE-mediated cardiomyocyte ferroptosis plays an important role in prolonged I/R injury.","['15-HpETE', 'ML351', 'ferroptosis', 'myocardium']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36986889,Apelin Is a Prototype of Novel Drugs for the Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction and Adverse Myocardial Remodeling.,"In-hospital mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is 5-6%. Consequently, it is necessary to develop fundamentally novel drugs capable of reducing mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Apelins could be the prototype for such drugs. Chronic administration of apelins mitigates adverse myocardial remodeling in animals with myocardial infarction or pressure overload. The cardioprotective effect of apelins is accompanied by blockage of the MPT pore, GSK-3β, and the activation of PI3-kinase, Akt, ERK1/2, NO-synthase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, matrix metalloproteinase, the epidermal growth factor receptor, Src kinase, the mitoKATP channel, guanylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, the Na+/H+ exchanger, and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. The cardioprotective effect of apelins is associated with the inhibition of apoptosis and ferroptosis. Apelins stimulate the autophagy of cardiomyocytes. Synthetic apelin analogues are prospective compounds for the development of novel cardioprotective drugs.","['adverse remodeling', 'apelin', 'heart', 'ischemia/reperfusion']",2023-01-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36986753,Extracellular Vesicles as Drug Delivery Systems in Organ Transplantation: The Next Frontier.,"Extracellular vesicles are lipid bilayer-delimited nanoparticles excreted into the extracellular space by all cells. They carry a cargo rich in proteins, lipids and DNA, as well as a full complement of RNA species, which they deliver to recipient cells to induce downstream signalling, and they play a key role in many physiological and pathological processes. There is evidence that native and hybrid EVs may be used as effective drug delivery systems, with their intrinsic ability to protect and deliver a functional cargo by utilising endogenous cellular mechanisms making them attractive as therapeutics. Organ transplantation is the gold standard for treatment for suitable patients with end-stage organ failure. However, significant challenges still remain in organ transplantation; prevention of graft rejection requires heavy immunosuppression and the lack of donor organs results in a failure to meet demand, as manifested by growing waiting lists. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the ability of EVs to prevent rejection in transplantation and mitigate ischemia reperfusion injury in several disease models. The findings of this work have made clinical translation of EVs possible, with several clinical trials actively recruiting patients. However, there is much to be uncovered, and it is essential to understand the mechanisms behind the therapeutic benefits of EVs. Machine perfusion of isolated organs provides an unparalleled platform for the investigation of EV biology and the testing of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of EVs. This review classifies EVs and their biogenesis routes, and discusses the isolation and characterisation methods adopted by the international EV research community, before delving into what is known about EVs as drug delivery systems and why organ transplantation represents an ideal platform for their development as drug delivery systems.","['allograft rejection', 'drug delivery systems', 'exosomes', 'extracellular vesicles', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'machine perfusion', 'organ transplantation']",2022-11-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36986552,Cyclocreatine Phosphate: A Novel Bioenergetic/Anti-Inflammatory Drug That Resuscitates Poorly Functioning Hearts and Protects against Development of Heart Failure.,"Irreversible myocardial injury causes the exhaustion of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contributing to heart failure (HF). Cyclocreatine phosphate (CCrP) was shown to preserve myocardial ATP during ischemia and maintain cardiac function in various animal models of ischemia/reperfusion. We tested whether CCrP administered prophylactically/therapeutically prevents HF secondary to ischemic injury in an isoproterenol (ISO) rat model. Thirty-nine rats were allocated into five groups: control/saline, control/CCrP, ISO/saline (85 and 170 mg/kg/day s.c. for 2 consecutive days), and ISO/CCrP (0.8 g/kg/day i.p.) either administrated 24 h or 1 h before ISO administration (prophylactic regimen) or 1 h after the last ISO injection (therapeutic regimen) and then daily for 2 weeks. CCrP protected against ISO-induced CK-MB elevation and ECG/ST changes when administered prophylactically or therapeutically. CCrP administered prophylactically decreased heart weight, hs-TnI, TNF-α, TGF-β, and caspase-3, as well as increased EF%, eNOS, and connexin-43, and maintained physical activity. Histology indicated a marked decrease in cardiac remodeling (fibrin and collagen deposition) in the ISO/CCrP rats. Similarly, therapeutically administered CCrP showed normal EF% and physical activity, as well as normal serum levels of hs-TnI and BNP. In conclusion, the bioenergetic/anti-inflammatory CCrP is a promising safe drug against myocardial ischemic sequelae, including HF, promoting its clinical application to salvage poorly functioning hearts.","['adenosine triphosphate', 'anti-inflammatory', 'bioenergetic', 'cyclocreatine phosphate', 'heart failure', 'myocardial ischemia']",2023-02-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36986541,"Anethole Pretreatment Modulates Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion: The Role of JNK, p38, MMP-2 and MMP-9 Pathways.","Anethole (AN) is one of the major constituents of several plant oils, demonstrating plentiful pharmacological actions. Ischemic stroke is the main cause of morbidity and death worldwide, particularly since ischemic stroke therapeutic choices are inadequate and limited; thus, the development of new therapeutic options is indispensable. This study was planned to explore the preventive actions of AN in ameliorating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain damage and BBB permeability leakage, as well as to explore anethole's potential mechanisms of action. The proposed mechanisms included modulating JNK and p38 as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9 pathways. Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomly assigned into four groups: sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), AN125 + MCAO, and AN250 + MCAO. Animals in the third and fourth groups were pretreated with AN 125 or 250 mg/kg orally, respectively, for two weeks before performing middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemic/reperfusion surgery. Animals that experienced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion exhibited amplified infarct volume, Evans blue intensity, brain water content, Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells, severe neurological deficits, and numerous histopathological alterations. MCAO animals exhibited elevated MMP-9 and MMP-2 gene expressions, enzyme activities, augmented JNK, and p38 phosphorylation. On the other hand, pretreatment with AN diminished the infarct volume, Evans blue dye intensity, brain water content, and Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells, improved the neurological score and enhanced histopathological examination. AN effectively lowered MMP-9 and MMP-2 gene expression and enzyme activities and diminished phosphorylated JNK, p38. AN decreased MDA content, amplified GSH/GSSG ratio, SOD, and CAT, decreased the serum and brain tissue homogenate inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β), NF-κB, and deterred the apoptotic status. This study revealed the neuroprotective ability of AN against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats. AN boosted blood-brain barrier integrity via modulating MMPs and diminished oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis through the JNK/p38 pathway.","['JNK/p38 pathway', 'anethole', 'blood–brain barrier integrity', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'infarct volume']",2022-12-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36984859,Blackberry-Loaded AgNPs Attenuate Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway.,"Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a pathophysiological insult that often occurs during liver surgery. Blackberry leaves are known for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.To achieve site-specific delivery of blackberry leaves extract (BBE) loaded AgNPs to the hepatocyte in IRI and to verify possible molecular mechanisms.IRI was induced in male Wister rats. Liver injury, hepatic histology, oxidative stress markers, hepatic expression of apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated. Non-targeted metabolomics for chemical characterization of blackberry leaves extract was performed.Pre-treatment with BBE protected against the deterioration caused by I/R, depicted by a significant improvement of liver functions and structure, as well as reduction of oxidative stress with a concomitant increase in antioxidants. Additionally, BBE promoted phosphorylation of antiapoptotic proteins; PI3K, Akt and mTOR, while apoptotic proteins; Bax, Casp-9 and cleaved Casp-3 expressions were decreased. LC-HRMS-based metabolomics identified a range of metabolites, mainly flavonoids and anthocyanins. Upon comprehensive virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation, the major annotated anthocyanins, cyanidin and pelargonidin glucosides, were suggested to act as PLA2 inhibitors.BBE can ameliorate hepatic IRI augmented by BBE-AgNPs nano-formulation via suppressing, oxidative stress and apoptosis as well as stimulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.","['AgNPs', 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR', 'blackberry', 'caspase-3', 'cell apoptosis', 'liver ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'metabolomics']",2023-02-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36984459,Changes in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction and Oxidative Stress after Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Treatment in an Experimental Model of Retrograde Rat Perfusion.,"Background and objectives: Taking into consideration the confirmed role of oxidative stress in ischemia/reperfusion injury and the insufficiency in knowledge regarding the phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5)-mediated effects on the cardiovascular system, the aim of our study was to investigate the influence of two PDE5 inhibitors, tadalafil and vardenafil, with or without the addition of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), on oxidative stress markers, coronary flow and left ventricular function, both ex vivo and in vivo. Methods: This study included 74 male Wistar albino rats divided into two groups. In the first, 24 male Wistar rats were orally treated with tadalafil or vardenafil for four weeks in order to perform in vivo experiments. In the second, the hearts of 50 male Wistar albino were excised and perfused according to the Langendorff technique in order to perform ex vivo experiments. The hearts were perfused with tadalafil (10, 20, 50 and 200 nM), vardenafil (10, 20, 50 and 200 nM) and a combination of tadalafil/vardenafil and L-NAME (30 μM). The CF and oxidative stress markers, including nitrite bioaviability (NO2-), superoxide anion radical (O2-), and the index of lipid peroxidation, were measured in coronary effluent. Results: The L-arginin/NO system acts as the mediator in the tadalafil-induced effects on the cardiovascular system, while it seems that the vardenafil-induced increase in CF was not primarily induced by the NO system. Although tadalafil induced an increase in O2- in the two lowest doses, the general effects of both of the applied PDE5 inhibitors on oxidative stress were not significant. The ejection function was above 50% in both groups. Conclusions: Our results showed that both tadalafil and vardenafil improved the coronary perfusion of the myocardium and LV function by increasing the EF.","['Langendorff technique', 'ejection fractioning', 'isolated rat heart', 'oxidative stress', 'tadalafil', 'vardenafil']",2023-01-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36983862,Isolated Mitochondria State after Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Cardioprotection: Analysis by Flow Cytometry.,"Mitochondria are key organelles involved in cell survival and death during the acute phenomena of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (i.e., myocardial infarction). To investigate the functions of isolated mitochondria such as calcium retention capacity, oxidative phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, already established methods are based on extramitochondrial measurements of the whole mitochondria population.The aim of this study was to develop a reliable and well-characterized method for multiparametric analysis of isolated single mitochondrion by flow cytometry (FC) in the context of myocardial infarction. The advantage of FC is the possibility to give a simultaneous analysis of morphological parameters (side and forward scatters: SSC and FSC) for each mitochondrion, combined with intramitochondrial measurements of several biological markers, such as ROS production or membrane potential (Δφm), using specific fluorescent probes.For this study, a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion and a protective approach of post-conditioning using low reperfusion pressure was used. Thanks to the use of specific probes (NAO, MTR, TMRM, DilC1, and DHR123) combined with flow cytometry, we propose a method: (i) to identify mitochondrial populations of interest based on quality criteria (NAO/TMRM double staining); (ii) to monitor their morphological criteria, especially during swelling due to calcium overload; and (iii) to compare mitochondrial functions (membrane potential and ROS production) in different experimental groups. Applied to mitochondria from ischemic hearts, these measurements revealed that individual mitochondria are altered and that cardioprotection by low-pressure reperfusion reduces damage, as expected.Our results highlight FC as a reliable and sensitive method to investigate changes in mitochondrial functions and morphology in pathological conditions that disrupts their activity such as the case in ischemia-reperfusion. This methodological approach can be extended to other pathologies involving mitochondrial dysfunctions. Moreover, FC offers the possibility to work with very small amounts of isolated mitochondria, a factor that may limit the use of classical methods.","['flow cytometry', 'ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)', 'mitochondria', 'postconditioning']",2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36983624,Pooled Analysis of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicle Therapy for Liver Disease in Preclinical Models.,"Although increasing preclinical studies have emphasized the benefits of exosome-related therapies, the efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) for liver injury is unclear. In this work, a pooled analysis was conducted to explore the overall effect of MSC-EV in animal models.A systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases was performed, from initiation to February 2022, for preclinical studies with liver disease models. The treatment outcomes were evaluated based on liver function, histological analysis, and inflammatory cytokines.After screening, 39 studies were included. Pooled analyses demonstrated that MSC-EV therapy significantly improved liver functions (ALB, ALT, AST, ALP, and γ-GT), promoted the repair of injured liver tissue (damaged area, Ishak's score), reduced inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ), and increased an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) compared to the placebo control group. Subgroup analyses indicated that MSC-EV had therapeutic effects on liver fibrosis (n = 16), acute liver injury (n = 11), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (n = 3), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4), and hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (n = 6). Additionally, the therapeutic effect of EV was comparable to that of MSCs.MSC-EV have therapeutic potential for acute and chronic liver diseases.","['extracellular vesicle', 'liver disease', 'mesenchymal stromal cell', 'meta-analysis']",2023-02-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36983406,Retinal Ischaemia in Diabetic Retinopathy: Understanding and Overcoming a Therapeutic Challenge.,"Retinal ischaemia is present to a greater or lesser extent in all eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Nonetheless, our understanding of its pathogenic mechanisms, risk factors, as well as other characteristics of retinal ischaemia in DR is very limited. To date, there is no treatment to revascularise ischaemic retina.Review of the literature highlighting the current knowledge on the topic of retinal ischaemia in DR, important observations made, and underlying gaps for which research is needed.A very scarce number of clinical studies, mostly cross-sectional, have evaluated specifically retinal ischaemia in DR. Interindividual variability on its natural course and consequences, including the development of its major complications, namely diabetic macular ischaemia and proliferative diabetic retinopathy, have not been investigated. The in situ, surrounding, and distance effect of retinal ischaemia on retinal function and structure and its change over time remains also to be elucidated. Treatments to prevent the development of retinal ischaemia and, importantly, to achieve retinal reperfusion once capillary drop out has ensued, are very much needed and remain to be developed.Research into retinal ischaemia in diabetes should be a priority to save sight.","['DMI', 'DR', 'FFA', 'OCT', 'OCT angiography', 'OCTA', 'UWF FFA', 'diabetes', 'diabetic macular ischaemia', 'diabetic retinopathy', 'optical coherence tomography angiography', 'retinal capillary dropout', 'retinal function', 'retinal ischaemia', 'retinal nonperfusion', 'ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography']",2023-01-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36983119,Age-Related Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mechanical Reperfusion and 30-Day Mortality for STEMI: Results of the ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 Registry.,"The constraints in the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during the COVID-19 pandemic have been suggested to have severely impacted mortality levels. The aim of the current analysis is to evaluate the age-related effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mechanical reperfusion and 30-day mortality for STEMI within the registry ISACS-STEMI COVID-19.This retrospective multicenter registry was performed in high-volume PPCI centers on four continents and included STEMI patients undergoing PPCI in March-June 2019 and 2020. Patients were divided according to age (< or ≥75 years). The main outcomes were the incidence and timing of PPCI, (ischemia time longer than 12 h and door-to-balloon longer than 30 min), and in-hospital or 30-day mortality.We included 16,683 patients undergoing PPCI in 109 centers. In 2020, during the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in PPCI as compared to 2019 (IRR 0.843 (95%-CI: 0.825-0.861, p < 0.0001). We found a significant age-related reduction (7%, p = 0.015), with a larger effect on elderly than on younger patients. Furthermore, we observed significantly higher 30-day mortality during the pandemic period, especially among the elderly (13.6% vs. 17.9%, adjusted HR (95% CI) = 1.55 [1.24-1.93], p < 0.001) as compared to younger patients (4.8% vs. 5.7%; adjusted HR (95% CI) = 1.25 [1.05-1.49], p = 0.013), as a potential consequence of the significantly longer ischemia time observed during the pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a 16% reduction in PPCI procedures, with a larger reduction and a longer delay to treatment among elderly patients, which may have contributed to increase in-hospital and 30-day mortality during the pandemic.","['COVID-19', 'ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction', 'ageing']",2022-12-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36983098,Brain Hypothermia Therapy and Targeted Temperature Management for Acute Encephalopathy in Children: Status and Prospects.,"In adult intensive care, brain hypothermia therapy (BHT) was reported to be effective in neuroprotection after resuscitation and cardiac arrest. By contrast, in neonatal intensive care, the pathophysiology of brain damage caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is attributed to circulatory disturbances resulting from ischemia/reperfusion, for which neonatal brain cryotherapy is used. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, 2010, recommends cerebral cryotherapy for HIE associated with severe neonatal pseudoparenchyma death. The usefulness of BHT for neuroprotection in infants and children, especially in pediatric acute encephalopathy, is expected. Theoretically, BHT could be useful in basic medical science and animal experiments. However, there are limitations in clinical planning for treating pediatric acute encephalopathy. No international collaborative study has been conducted, and no clinical evidence exists for neuroprotection using BHT. In this review, we will discuss the pathogenesis of neuronal damage in hypoxic and hypoperfused brains; the history of BHT, its effects, and mechanisms of action; the success of BHT; cooling and monitoring methods of BHT; adverse reactions to BHT; literature on BHT. We will review the latest literature on targeted temperature management, which is used for maintaining and controlling body temperature in adults in intensive care. Finally, we will discuss the development of BHT and targeted temperature management as treatments for pediatric acute encephalopathy.","['brain hypothermia therapy', 'hibernation', 'neuronal protection', 'target temperature management']",2022-12-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36982872,Characterization of the Involvement of Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α-Stimulated Gene 6 (TSG-6) in Ischemic Brain Injury Caused by Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Mouse.,"The identification of novel targets to modulate the immune response triggered by cerebral ischemia is crucial to promote the development of effective stroke therapeutics. Since tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), a hyaluronate (HA)-binding protein, is involved in the regulation of immune and stromal cell functions in acute neurodegeneration, we aimed to characterize its involvement in ischemic stroke. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (1 h MCAo, followed by 6 to 48 of reperfusion) in mice resulted in a significant elevation in cerebral TSG-6 protein levels, mainly localized in neurons and myeloid cells of the lesioned hemisphere. These myeloid cells were clearly infiltrating from the blood, strongly suggesting that brain ischemia also affects TSG-6 in the periphery. Accordingly, TSG-6 mRNA expression was elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients 48 h after ischemic stroke onset, and TSG-6 protein expression was higher in the plasma of mice subjected to 1 h MCAo followed by 48 h of reperfusion. Surprisingly, plasma TSG-6 levels were reduced in the acute phase (i.e., within 24 h of reperfusion) when compared to sham-operated mice, supporting the hypothesis of a detrimental role of TSG-6 in the early reperfusion stage. Accordingly, systemic acute administration of recombinant mouse TSG-6 increased brain levels of the M2 marker Ym1, providing a significant reduction in the brain infarct volume and general neurological deficits in mice subjected to transient MCAo. These findings suggest a pivotal role of TSG-6 in ischemic stroke pathobiology and underscore the clinical relevance of further investigating the mechanisms underlying its immunoregulatory role.","['TSG-6', 'cerebral ischemia', 'immune system', 'neurodegeneration', 'neuroinflammation', 'stroke']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36982554,Cold Storage Followed by Transplantation Induces Interferon-Gamma and STAT-1 in Kidney Grafts.,"Cold storage (CS)-mediated inflammation, a reality of donor kidney processing and transplantation, can contribute to organ graft failure. However, the mechanisms by which this inflammation is perpetuated during and after CS remain unclear. Here, we examined the immunoregulatory roles of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family proteins, most notably STAT1 and STAT3, with our in vivo model of renal CS and transplant. Donor rat kidneys were exposed to 4 h or 18 h of CS, which was then followed by transplantation (CS + transplant). STAT total protein level and activity (phosphorylation) were evaluated via Western blot analysis and mRNA expression was tabulated using quantitative RT-PCR after organ harvest on day 1 or day 9 post-surgery. In vivo assays were further corroborated via similar analyses featuring in vitro models, specifically proximal tubular cells (human and rat) as well as macrophage cells (Raw 264.7). Strikingly, gene expression of IFN-γ (a pro-inflammatory cytokine inducer of STAT) and STAT1 were markedly increased after CS + transplant. STAT3 dephosphorylation was additionally observed after CS, a result suggestive of dysregulation of anti-inflammatory signaling as phosphorylated STAT3 acts as a transcription factor in the nucleus to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory signaling molecules. In vitro, IFN-γ gene expression as well as amplification of downstream STAT1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; a hallmark of ischemia reperfusion injury) was remarkably increased after CS + rewarming. Collectively, these results demonstrate that aberrant induction of STAT1 is sustained in vivo post-CS exposure and post-transplant. Thus, Jak/STAT signaling may be a viable therapeutic target during CS to mitigate poor graft outcomes when transplanting kidneys from deceased donors.","['cold ischemia', 'interferon gamma', 'kidney transplantation', 'stat1', 'stat3', 'transcription factor', 'viaspan']",2023-01-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36982395,PPAR Alpha Activation by Clofibrate Alleviates Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Metabolic Syndrome Rats by Decreasing Cardiac Inflammation and Remodeling and by Regulating the Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Compensatory Response.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of factors that increase the risk of developing diabetes, stroke, and heart failure. The pathophysiology of injury by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is highly complex and the inflammatory condition plays an important role by increasing matrix remodeling and cardiac apoptosis. Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are cardiac hormones with numerous beneficial effects mainly mediated by a cell surface receptor named atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (ANPr). Although NPs are powerful clinical markers of cardiac failure, their role in I/R is still controversial. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonists exert cardiovascular therapeutic actions; however, their effect on the NPs' signaling pathway has not been extensively studied. Our study provides important insight into the regulation of both ANP and ANPr in the hearts of MetS rats and their association with the inflammatory conditions caused by damage from I/R. Moreover, we show that pre-treatment with clofibrate was able to decrease the inflammatory response that, in turn, decreases myocardial fibrosis, the expression of metalloprotease 2 and apoptosis. Treatment with clofibrate is also associated with a decrease in ANP and ANPr expression.","['PPAR alpha agonist', 'cardiac inflammation', 'cardiac remodeling', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'metabolic syndrome', 'natriuretic peptides']",2023-01-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36982389,Mechanism Repositioning Based on Integrative Pharmacology: Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Safflower in Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius. L) possesses anti-tumor, anti-thrombotic, anti-oxidative, immunoregulatory, and cardio-cerebral protective effects. It is used clinically for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular disease in China. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of safflower extract on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) injury in a left anterior descending (LAD)-ligated model based on integrative pharmacology study and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS). Safflower (62.5, 125, 250 mg/kg) was administered immediately before reperfusion. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)/Evans blue, echocardiography, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ability, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were determined after 24 h of reperfusion. Chemical components were obtained using UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to analyze mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Safflower dose-dependently reduced myocardial infarct size, improved cardiac function, decreased LDH levels, and increased SOD levels in C57/BL6 mice. A total of 11 key components and 31 hub targets were filtered based on the network analysis. Comprehensive analysis indicated that safflower alleviated inflammatory effects by downregulating the expression of NFκB1, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18, TNFα, and MCP-1 and upregulating NFκBia, and markedly increased the expression of phosphorylated PI3K, AKT, PKC, and ERK/2, HIF1α, VEGFA, and BCL2, and decreased the level of BAX and phosphorylated p65. Safflower shows a significant cardioprotective effect by activating multiple inflammation-related signaling pathways, including the NFκB, HIF-1α, MAPK, TNF, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. These findings provide valuable insights into the clinical applications of safflower.","['LAD ligation', 'UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS', 'inflammation-related signaling pathways', 'integrative pharmacology', 'myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'safflower']",2023-02-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36982284,Nanoparticles in the New Era of Cardiovascular Therapeutics: Challenges and Opportunities.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although a cadre of therapeutic strategies have been made available for CVDs in the clinical setting, predominantly through medication and surgery, these do not fully address the clinical needs of patients with CVD. As a new technique for CVD treatment, nanocarriers are employed to modify and package medications to ease the targeting of tissues, cells and molecules within the cardiovascular system. Nanocarriers are made of biomaterials, metals, or a combination of these materials, with sizes similar to bioactive molecules such as proteins and DNA. Cardiovascular nanomedicine (CVN) has only surfaced in recent years and is still in its infancy. Ample studies have displayed promise for the clinical utility of nanomedicine techniques, courtesy of continued perfection in nanocarrier design to optimize drug delivery and treatment outcomes. Here in this review, we will summarize the research advances in the literature on nanoparticles in the management of CVDs, including ischemic and coronary heart disease (e.g., atherosclerosis, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction), myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, aortic aneurysm, myocarditis, hypertension, and pulmonary artery hypertension and thrombosis.","['cardiovascular disease', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'ischemic heart disease', 'nanoparticle', 'therapy']",2022-12-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36982182,Extracellular Vesicles: The Future of Diagnosis in Solid Organ Transplantation?,"Solid organ transplantation (SOT) is a life-saving treatment for end-stage organ failure, but it comes with several challenges, the most important of which is the existing gap between the need for transplants and organ availability. One of the main concerns in this regard is the lack of accurate non-invasive biomarkers to monitor the status of a transplanted organ. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as a promising source of biomarkers for various diseases. In the context of SOT, EVs have been shown to be involved in the communication between donor and recipient cells and may carry valuable information about the function of an allograft. This has led to an increasing interest in exploring the use of EVs for the preoperative assessment of organs, early postoperative monitoring of graft function, or the diagnosis of rejection, infection, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or drug toxicity. In this review, we summarize recent evidence on the use of EVs as biomarkers for these conditions and discuss their applicability in the clinical setting.","['diagnostic', 'exosomes', 'transplant']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36981358,Nonlinear Dynamics of Heart Rate Variability after Acutely Induced Myocardial Ischemia by Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty.,"Several heart rate variability (HRV) characteristics of patients with myocardial ischemia are associated with a higher mortality risk. However, the immediate effect of acute ischemia on the HRV nonlinear dynamical behavior is unknown. The objective of this work is to explore the presence of nonlinearity through surrogate data testing and describe the dynamical behavior of HRV in acutely induced ischemia by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with linear and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Short-term electrocardiographic recordings from 68 patients before and after being treated with elective PTCA were selected from a publicly available database. The presence of nonlinear behavior was confirmed by determinism and laminarity in a relevant proportion of HRV time series, in up to 29.4% during baseline conditions and 30.9% after PTCA without statistical difference between these scenarios. After PTCA, the mean value and standard deviation of HRV time series decreased, while determinism and laminarity values increased. Here, the diminishment in overall variability caused by PTCA is not accompanied by a change in nonlinearity detection. Therefore, the presence of nonlinear behavior in HRV time series is not necessarily in agreement with the change of traditional and RQA measures.","['heart rate variability', 'nonlinearity', 'percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography', 'recurrence plot', 'reperfusion', 'surrogate data']",2023-01-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36980253,Effect of Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning on Perioperative Endothelial Dysfunction in Non-Cardiac Surgery: A Randomised Clinical Trial.,"Endothelial dysfunction result from inflammation and excessive production of reactive oxygen species as part of the surgical stress response. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) potentially exerts anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, which might stabilise the endothelial function after non-cardiac surgery. This was a single centre randomised clinical trial including 60 patients undergoing sub-acute laparoscopic cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis. Patients were randomised to RIPC or control. The RIPC procedure consisted of four cycles of five minutes of ischaemia and reperfusion of one upper extremity. Endothelial function was assessed as the reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) and circulating biomarkers of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability (L-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), L-arginine/ADMA ratio, tetra- and dihydrobiopterin (BH4 and BH2), and total plasma biopterin) preoperative, 2-4 h after surgery and 24 h after surgery. RHI did not differ between the groups (p = 0.07). Neither did levels of circulating biomarkers of NO bioavailability change in response to RIPC. L-arginine and L-arginine/ADMA ratio was suppressed preoperatively and increased 24 h after surgery (p < 0.001). The BH4/BH2-ratio had a high preoperative level, decreased 2-4 h after surgery and remained low 24 h after surgery (p = 0.01). RIPC did not influence endothelial function or markers of NO bioavailability until 24 h after sub-acute laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In response to surgery, markers of NO bioavailability increased, and oxidative stress decreased. These findings support that a minimally invasive removal of the inflamed gallbladder countereffects reduced markers of NO bioavailability and increased oxidative stress caused by acute cholecystitis.","['ADMA', 'L-arginine', 'biopterin', 'endothelial function', 'nitric oxide bioavailability', 'oxidative stress', 'reactive hyperaemia index', 'remote ischemic preconditioning', 'surgical stress']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36980225,Ischemic Tolerance-A Way to Reduce the Extent of Ischemia-Reperfusion Damage.,"Individual tissues have significantly different resistance to ischemia-reperfusion damage. There is still no adequate treatment for the consequences of ischemia-reperfusion damage. By utilizing ischemic tolerance, it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in the extent of the cell damage due to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Since ischemia-reperfusion damage usually occurs unexpectedly, the use of preconditioning is extremely limited. In contrast, postconditioning has wider possibilities for use in practice. In both cases, the activation of ischemic tolerance can also be achieved by the application of sublethal stress on a remote organ. Despite very encouraging and successful results in animal experiments, the clinical results have been disappointing so far. To avoid the factors that prevent the activation of ischemic tolerance, the solution has been to use blood plasma containing tolerance effectors. This plasma is taken from healthy donors in which, after exposure to two sublethal stresses within 48 h, effectors of ischemic tolerance occur in the plasma. Application of this activated plasma to recipient animals after the end of lethal ischemia prevents cell death and significantly reduces the consequences of ischemia-reperfusion damage. Until there is a clear chemical identification of the end products of ischemic tolerance, the simplest way of enhancing ischemic tolerance will be the preparation of activated plasma from young healthy donors with the possibility of its immediate use in recipients during the initial treatment.","['ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'ischemic tolerance', 'postconditioning', 'preconditioning']",2023-02-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36980208,New Insights into the Role of Ferroptosis in Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the principal cause of disease burden and death worldwide. Ferroptosis is a new form of regulated cell death mainly characterized by altered iron metabolism, increased polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation by reactive oxygen species, depletion of glutathione and inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 4. Recently, a series of studies have indicated that ferroptosis is involved in the death of cardiac and vascular cells and has a key impact on the mechanisms leading to CVDs such as ischemic heart disease, ischemia/reperfusion injury, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. In this article, we reviewed the molecular mechanism of ferroptosis and the current understanding of the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis in ischemic heart disease and in some cardiomyopathies. Moreover, the comprehension of the machinery governing ferroptosis in vascular cells and cardiomyocytes may provide new insights into preventive and therapeutic strategies in CVDs.","['antioxidants', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'ferroptosis', 'iron overload', 'oxidative stress']",2023-02-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36980186,Sestrin2 Mediates Metformin Rescued the Age-Related Cardiac Dysfunctions of Cardiorenal Syndrome Type 3.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) leads to acute cardiac injury and dysfunction in cardiorenal syndrome Type 3 (CRS3) through oxidative stress (OS). The stress-inducible Sestrin2 (Sesn2) protein reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and activates AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) to regulate cellular metabolism and energetics during OS. Sesn2 levels and its protective effects decline in the aged heart. Antidiabetic drug metformin upregulates Sesn2 levels in response to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) stress. However, the role of metformin in CRS3 remains unknown. This study seeks to explore how the age-related decrease in cardiac Sesn2 levels contributes to cardiac intolerance to AKI-induced insults, and how metformin ameliorates CRS3 through Sesn2. Young (3-5 months) and aged (21-23 months) C57BL/6J wild-type mice along with cardiomyocyte-specific knockout (cSesn2-/-) and their wild type of littermate (Sesn2f/f) C57BL/6J mice were subjected to AKI for 15 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Cardiac and mitochondrial functions were evaluated through echocardiograms and seahorse mitochondria respirational analysis. Renal and cardiac tissue was collected for histological analysis and immunoblotting. The results indicate that metformin could significantly rescue AKI-induced cardiac dysfunction and injury via Sesn2 through an improvement in systolic and diastolic function, fibrotic and cellular damage, and mitochondrial function in young, Sesn2f/f, and especially aged mice. Metformin significantly increased Sesn2 expression under AKI stress in the aged left-ventricular tissue. Thus, this study suggests that Sesn2 mediates the cardioprotective effects of metformin during post-AKI.","['Sestrin2', 'acute kidney injury', 'aging', 'cardiorenal syndrome 3', 'metformin']",2022-12-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979927,Preservation of Mitochondrial Health in Liver Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,"Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) is a major cause of the development of complications in different clinical settings such as liver resection and liver transplantation. Damage arising from LIRI is a major risk factor for early graft rejection and is associated with higher morbidity and mortality after surgery. Although the mechanisms leading to the injury of parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cells are not yet fully understood, mitochondrial dysfunction is recognized as a hallmark of LIRI that exacerbates cellular injury. Mitochondria play a major role in glucose metabolism, energy production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, calcium homeostasis and cell death. The diverse roles of mitochondria make it essential to preserve mitochondrial health in order to maintain cellular activity and liver integrity during liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). A growing body of studies suggest that protecting mitochondria by regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, fission/fusion and mitophagy during liver I/R ameliorates LIRI. Targeting mitochondria in conditions that exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction, such as steatosis and aging, has been successful in decreasing their susceptibility to LIRI. Studying mitochondrial dysfunction will help understand the underlying mechanisms of cellular damage during LIRI which is important for the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving patient outcomes. In this review, we highlight the progress made in recent years regarding the role of mitochondria in liver I/R and discuss the impact of liver conditions on LIRI.","['aging', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'liver', 'mitochondria', 'steatosis']",2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979794,Molecular Investigation of DKK3 in Cerebral Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury.,"Dickkopf-3 (Dkk3) is an atypical member of the Dkk family of Wnt inhibitors, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. Its role in the mechanisms of cellular degeneration and protection is still unknown. The aim of our work is to investigate the endogenous activation of the DKK3 pathway in a model of transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. In particular, the animals were subjected to 1 h of ischemia followed by different reperfusion times (1 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h) to evaluate the downstream pathway and the time course of its activation. Western blot analysis showed increased Dkk3 expression in animals with the highest time of reperfusion. The increased levels of Dkk3 were accompanied by reduced Wnt3a, Frz1 and PIWI1a expression in the cytosol while FOXM1 and β-catenin decreased in the nucleus. These molecular changes led to an increase in the apoptotic pathway, as showed by the increased expression of Caspase 3 and Bax and the reduced levels of Bcl-2, and to a decrease in neurogenesis, as shown by the decreased expression of Tbr2, Ngn2 and Pax6. In the second part of the study, we decided to employ curcumin, an activator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, to investigate its effect on Dkk3. In particular, curcumin was administered 1 and 6 h after ischemia, and animals were sacrificed 24 h later when the expression of Dkk3 was higher. Our data displayed that curcumin administration decreased Dkk3 expression, and increased Wnt3a, Frz1 and PIWI1a levels. Well in line with these data, curcumin administration increased nuclear β-catenin and FOXM1 expression. The down-regulation of Dkk3 by curcumin led to reduced apoptosis and increased neurogenesis. Summarizing, our results showed that Dkk3 acts as an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during cerebral ischemia. Additionally, its inhibition and the contextual activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway are protective against ischemic stroke.","['DKK3', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'stroke']",2023-02-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979777,Tissue Engineering and Targeted Drug Delivery in Cardiovascular Disease: The Role of Polymer Nanocarrier for Statin Therapy.,"Atherosclerosis-related coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. This requires effective primary and secondary prevention in reducing the complications related to CAD; the regression or stabilization of the pathology remains the mainstay of treatment. Statins have proved to be the most effective treatment in reducing adverse effects, but there are limitations related to the administration and achievement of effective doses as well as side effects due to the lack of target-related molecular specificity. The implemented technological steps are polymers and nanoparticles for the administration of statins, as it has been seen how the conjugation of drug delivery systems (DDSs) with statins increases bioavailability by circumventing the hepatic-renal filter and increases the related target specificity, enhancing their action and decreasing side effects. Reduction of endothelial dysfunction, reduced intimal hyperplasia, reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury, cardiac regeneration, positive remodeling in the extracellular matrix, reduced neointimal growth, and increased reendothelialization are all drug-related effects of statins enhanced by binding with DDSs. Recent preclinical studies demonstrate how the effect of statins stimulates the differentiation of endogenous cardiac stem cells. Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) seems to be the most promising DDS as it succeeds more than the others in enhancing the effect of the bound drug. This review intends to summarize the current evidence on polymers and nanoparticles for statin delivery in the field of cardiovascular disease, trying to shed light on this topic and identify new avenues for future studies.","['atherosclerosis', 'cardiovascular disease', 'polymer', 'statin']",2023-01-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979759,Nanotechnology in Stroke: New Trails with Smaller Scales.,"Stroke is a leading cause of death, long-term disability, and socioeconomic costs, highlighting the urgent need for effective treatment. During acute phase, intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a thrombolytic agent, and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), a mechanical intervention to retrieve clots, are the only FDA-approved treatments to re-establish cerebral blood flow. Due to a short therapeutic time window and high potential risk of cerebral hemorrhage, a limited number of acute stroke patients benefit from tPA treatment. EVT can be performed within an extended time window, but such intervention is performed only in patients with occlusion in a larger, anatomically more proximal vasculature and is carried out at specialty centers. Regardless of the method, in case of successful recanalization, ischemia-reperfusion injury represents an additional challenge. Further, tPA disrupts the blood-brain barrier integrity and is neurotoxic, aggravating reperfusion injury. Nanoparticle-based approaches have the potential to circumvent some of the above issues and develop a thrombolytic agent that can be administered safely beyond the time window for tPA treatment. Different attributes of nanoparticles are also being explored to develop a multifunctional thrombolytic agent that, in addition to a thrombolytic agent, can contain therapeutics such as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, neuro/vasoprotective, or imaging agent, i.e., a theragnostic agent. The focus of this review is to highlight these advances as they relate to cerebrovascular conditions to improve clinical outcomes in stroke patients.","['drug delivery', 'drug targeting', 'nanoparticles', 'oxidative stress', 'reperfusion injury', 'thrombolysis']",2023-01-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979693,Cardioprotective Effects of a Selective c-Jun N-terminal Kinase Inhibitor in a Rat Model of Myocardial Infarction.,"Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) is involved in myocardial injury, left ventricular remodeling (LV), and heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of a selective JNK inhibitor, 11H-indeno [1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime (IQ-1), on myocardial injury and acute myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in adult male Wistar rats. Intraperitoneal administration of IQ-1 (25 mg/kg daily for 5 days) resulted in a significant decrease in myocardial infarct size on day 5 after MI. On day 60 after MI, a significant (2.6-fold) decrease in LV scar size, a 2.2-fold decrease in the size of the LV cavity, a 2.9-fold decrease in the area of mature connective tissue, and a 1.7-fold decrease in connective tissue in the interventricular septum were observed compared with the control group. The improved contractile function of the heart resulted in a significant (33%) increase in stroke size, a 40% increase in cardiac output, a 12% increase in LV systolic pressure, a 28% increase in the LV maximum rate of pressure rise, a 45% increase in the LV maximum rate of pressure drop, a 29% increase in the contractility index, a 14% increase in aortic pressure, a 2.7-fold decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure, and a 4.2-fold decrease in LV minimum pressure. We conclude that IQ-1 has cardioprotective activity and reduces the severity of HF after MI.","['11H-indeno[1,2-b]quinoxalin-11-one oxime', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor', 'cardioprotective activity', 'heart failure', 'infarct size', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'myocardial infarction']",2023-01-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979668,Role of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells in Modulating Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury: Current State of the Art and Future Perspectives.,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a multistep damage that occurs in several tissues when a blood flow interruption is inevitable, such as during organ surgery or transplantation. It is responsible for cell death and tissue dysfunction, thus leading, in the case of transplantation, to organ rejection. IRI takes place during reperfusion, i.e., when blood flow is restored, by activating inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, causing mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of parenchymal cells. Unfortunately, none of the therapies currently in use are definitive, prompting the need for new therapeutic approaches. Scientific evidence has proven that mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can reduce inflammation and ROS, prompting this cellular therapy to also be investigated for treatment of IRI. Moreover, it has been shown that MSC therapeutic effects were mediated in part by their secretome, which appears to be involved in immune regulation and tissue repair. For these reasons, mediated MSC paracrine function might be key for injury amelioration upon IRI damage. In this review, we highlight the scientific literature on the potential beneficial use of MSCs and their products for improving IRI outcomes in different tissues/organs, focusing in particular on the paracrine effects mediated by MSCs, and on the molecular mechanisms behind these effects.","['MSC pre-conditioning', 'apoptosis', 'inflammation', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'mesenchymal stem/stromal cells', 'organ transplantation', 'secretome']",2023-02-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979152,Ischemic Conditioning to Reduce Fatigue in Isometric Skeletal Muscle Contraction.,"Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a non-invasive protective maneuver that alternates short periods of occlusion and reperfusion of tissue blood flow. Given the heterogeneity in the magnitude and frequency of IPC-induced improvements in physical performance, here we aimed to investigate, in a well-controlled experimental set-up, the local effects of IPC in exposed muscles in terms of tissue oxygenation and muscle fatigue. Nineteen subjects were enrolled in one of the two groups, IPC (3 × 5/5 min right arm ischemia/reperfusion; cuff inflations 250 mmHg) and SHAM (3 × 5/5 min pseudo ischemia/reperfusion; 20 mmHg). The subjects performed a fatiguing contraction protocol before and 30 min after the IPC treatment, consisting of unilateral intermittent isometric elbow flexions (3 s ON/OFF, 80% of maximal voluntary contraction) until exhaustion. While muscle strength did not differ between groups, post- vs. pre-treatment endurance was significantly reduced in the SHAM group (4.1 ± 1.9 vs. 6.4 ± 3.1 repetitions until exhaustion, p < 0.05) but maintained in IPC (7.3 ± 2.0 vs. 7.1 ± 4.3, n.s.). The decrease in tissue oxygenation and the increase in deoxygenated hemoglobin were significantly reduced post- vs. pre-IPC (p < 0.05), but not post- vs. pre-SHAM. The results suggest that IPC delays the onset of fatigue likely through improved metabolic efficiency of muscles.","['endurance', 'fatigue', 'ischemic pre-conditioning', 'isometric contraction', 'tissue oxygenation']",2023-02-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36979015,Taurine as Antioxidant in a Novel Cell- and Oxygen Carrier-Free Perfusate for Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Porcine Kidneys.,"Donor organ-shortage has resulted in the increased use of marginal grafts; however, normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) holds the potential for organ viability assessment and restoration of marginal grafts prior to transplantation. Additionally, cell-, oxygen carrier-free and antioxidants-supplemented solutions could potentially prevent adverse effects (transfusion reactions, inflammation, hemolysis), associated with the use of autologous packed red blood cell (pRBC)-based perfusates. This study compared 6 h NMP of porcine kidneys, using an established pRBC-based perfusate (pRBC, n = 7), with the novel cell- and oxygen carrier-free organ preservation solution Ecosol, containing taurine (Ecosol, n = 7). Despite the enhanced tissue edema and tubular injury in the Ecosol group, related to a suboptimal molecular mass of polyethylene glycol as colloid present in the solution, functional parameters (renal blood flow, intrarenal resistance, urinary flow, pH) and oxygenation (arterial pO2, absence of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha) were similar to the pRBC group. Furthermore, taurine significantly improved the antioxidant capacity in the Ecosol group, reflected in decreased lactate dehydrogenase, urine protein and tubular vacuolization compared to pRBC. This study demonstrates the feasibility of 6 h NMP using a taurine containing, cell- and oxygen carrier-free perfusate, achieving a comparable organ quality to pRBC perfused porcine kidneys.","['cell free perfusion', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'kidney preservation', 'normothermic machine perfusion', 'oxygen carrier-free perfusion', 'taurine']",2023-02-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This study aims to improve the flush-out and potentially decrease ischemic injury by the addition of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) to the flush medium. Porcine kidneys (n = 22) were extracted during organ recovery surgery. Pigs underwent brain death induction or a Sham operation, resulting in four groups: donation after brain death (DBD) control, DBD H2S, non-DBD control, and non-DBD H2S. Directly after the abdominal flush, kidneys were extracted and flushed with or without H2S and stored for 13 h via static cold storage (SCS) +/- H2S before reperfusion on normothermic machine perfusion. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-8 were significantly lower in H2S treated DBD kidneys during NMP (p = 0.03). The non-DBD kidneys show superiority in renal function (creatinine clearance and FENa) compared to the DBD control group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.004). No differences were seen in perfusion parameters, injury markers and histological appearance. We found an overall trend of better renal function in the non-DBD kidneys compared to the DBD kidneys. The addition of H2S during the flush out and SCS resulted in a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines without affecting renal function or injury markers.","['H2S', 'brain death', 'cytokines', 'ex vivo kidney perfusion', 'hydrogen sulphide', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'kidney graft preservation', 'transplantation']",2022-12-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36978898,H2S Donors with Cytoprotective Effects in Models of MI/R Injury and Chemotherapy-Induced Cardiotoxicity.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous signaling molecule that greatly influences several important (patho)physiological processes related to cardiovascular health and disease, including vasodilation, angiogenesis, inflammation, and cellular redox homeostasis. Consequently, H2S supplementation is an emerging area of interest, especially for the treatment of cardiovascular-related diseases. To fully unlock the medicinal properties of hydrogen sulfide, however, the development and refinement of H2S releasing compounds (or donors) are required to augment its bioavailability and to better mimic its natural enzymatic production. Categorizing donors by the biological stimulus that triggers their H2S release, this review highlights the fundamental chemistry and releasing mechanisms of a range of H2S donors that have exhibited promising protective effects in models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury and cancer chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, specifically. Thus, in addition to serving as important investigative tools that further advance our knowledge and understanding of H2S chemical biology, the compounds highlighted in this review have the potential to serve as vital therapeutic agents for the treatment (or prevention) of various cardiomyopathies.","['H2S codrugs', 'H2S donors', 'MI/R injury', 'cardioprotection', 'chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity', 'hydrogen sulfide']",2023-01-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

FOLFOX6, oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), possesses superior tumoricidal activity in comparison to 5-FU alone, but suffers seriously from dose-limiting platinum-associated Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN). The aim of the POLAR trials was to demonstrate that PledOx [calmangafodipir; Ca4Mn(DPDP)5] reduced the incidence of persistent CIPN from 40% to 20%. However, this assumption was based on ""explorative"" data in the preceding PLIANT phase II trial, which did not mirror the expected incidence of unwanted toxicity in placebo patients. In POLAR A and M, the assessment of PledOx efficacy was conducted in patients that received at least six cycles of FOLFOX6, enabling analyses of efficacy in 239 A and 88 M patients. Instead of a hypothesized improvement from 40% to 20% incidence of persistent CIPN in the PledOx group, i.e., a 50% improvement, the real outcome was the opposite, i.e., an about 50% worsening in this bothersome toxicity. Mechanisms that may explain the disastrous outcome, with a statistically significant number of patients being seriously injured after having received PledOx, indicate interactions between two redox active metal cations, Pt2+ (oxaliplatin) and Mn2+ (PledOx). A far from surprising causal relationship that escaped prior detection by the study group and the sponsor. Most importantly, recently published data (ref 1) unequivocally indicate that the PLIANT study was not suited to base clinical phase III studies on. In conclusion, the POLAR and PLIANT trials show that PledOx and related manganese-containing compounds are unsuited for co-treatment with platinum-containing compounds. For use as a therapeutic adjunct in rescue treatment, like in ischemia-reperfusion of the heart or other organs, or in acetaminophen (paracetamol)-associated liver failure, there is little or nothing speaking against the use of PledOx or other PLED compounds. However, this must be thoroughly documented in more carefully designed clinical trials.","['POLAR A and M trials', 'calmangafodipir (PledOx)', 'chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy', 'clinical phase III trials', 'drug interaction', 'manganese', 'oxaliplatin', 'platinum', 'redox active cations']",2022-12-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36978834,GYY4137-Derived Hydrogen Sulfide Donates Electrons to the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain via Sulfide: Quinone Oxidoreductase in Endothelial Cells.,"The protective effects of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) to limit oxidative injury and preserve mitochondrial function during sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion, and neurodegenerative diseases have prompted the development of soluble H2S-releasing compounds such as GYY4137. Yet, the effects of GYY4137 on the mitochondrial function of endothelial cells remain unclear, while this cell type comprises the first target cell after parenteral administration. Here, we specifically assessed whether human endothelial cells possess a functional sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), to oxidise GYY4137-released H2S within the mitochondria for electron donation to the electron transport chain. We demonstrate that H2S administration increases oxygen consumption by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which does not occur in the SQOR-deficient cell line SH-SY5Y. GYY4137 releases H2S in HUVECs in a dose- and time-dependent fashion as quantified by oxygen consumption and confirmed by lead acetate assay, as well as AzMC fluorescence. Scavenging of intracellular H2S using zinc confirmed intracellular and intramitochondrial sulfur, which resulted in mitotoxic zinc sulfide (ZnS) precipitates. Together, GYY4137 increases intramitochondrial H2S and boosts oxygen consumption of endothelial cells, which is likely governed via the oxidation of H2S by SQOR. This mechanism in endothelial cells may be instrumental in regulating H2S levels in blood and organs but can also be exploited to quantify H2S release by soluble donors such as GYY4137 in living systems.","['GYY4137', 'endothelial cells', 'hydrogen sulfide', 'mitochondria', 'sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase']",2023-01-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of dexmedetomidine on small intestinal in vitro contractility during different phases of ischaemia. Experimental segmental jejunal ischaemia was induced in 12 horses under general anaesthesia, and intestinal samples were taken pre-ischaemia and following ischaemia and reperfusion. Spontaneous and electrically evoked contractile activity of the circular and longitudinal smooth muscles were determined in each sample with and without the addition of dexmedetomidine. During a second experiment, tetrodotoxin was added to determine if the effect was neurogenic. We found that the circular smooth muscle (CSM) contractility was not affected by ischaemia, whereas the longitudinal smooth muscle (LSM) showed an increase in both spontaneous and induced contractile activity. The addition of dexmedetomidine caused a decrease in the spontaneous contractile activity of CSM, but an increase in that of LSM, which was not mediated by the enteric nervous system. During ischaemia, dexmedetomidine also mildly increased the electrically induced contractile activity in LSM. These results may indicate a stimulatory effect of dexmedetomidine on small intestinal contractility. However, the influence of dexmedetomidine administration on intestinal motility in vivo needs to be further investigated.","['basal contractile activity', 'colic', 'intestine', 'ischaemia', 'motility', 'organ bath', 'postoperative ileus', 'reperfusion', 'sedation', 'α2 agonist']",2023-01-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36978228,Failure of Costimulatory Blockade-induced Regulatory T Cells to Sustain Long-Term Survival of High Ischemic Allografts.,"Costimulatory blockade-induced allograft tolerance has been achieved in rodent models, but these strategies do not translate well to nonhuman primate and clinical transplants. One confounder that may underlie this discrepancy is the greater ischemic inflammation imposed on the transplants. In mice, cardiac allografts subjected to prolonged cold ischemic storage (CIS) before transplant have increased ischemia-reperfusion injury, which amplifies infiltrating endogenous memory CD8 T-cell activation within hours after transplantation to mediate acute graft inflammation and cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated molecule-4 immunoglobulin-resistant rejection. This study tested strategies inhibiting memory CD8 T-cell activation within such high ischemic allografts to achieve long-term survival.A/J (H-2a) hearts subjected to 0.5 or 8 h of CIS were transplanted to C57BL/6 (H-2b) recipients and treatment with peritransplant costimulatory blockade. At 60 d posttransplant, regulatory T cells (Treg) were depleted in recipients of high ischemic allografts with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or diphtheria toxin.Whereas peritransplant (days 0 and +1) anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 mAb and anti-CD154 mAb prolonged survival of >60% allografts subjected to minimal CIS for >100 d, only 20% of allografts subjected to prolonged CIS survived beyond day 80 posttransplant and rejection was accompanied by high titers of donor-specific antibody. Peritransplant anti-lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α, and anti-CD154 mAb plus additional anti-CD154 mAb on days 14 and 16 obviated this donor-specific antibody and promoted Treg-mediated tolerance and survival of 60% of high ischemic allografts beyond day 100 posttransplant, but all allografts failed by day 120.These studies indicate a strategy inducing prolonged high ischemic allograft survival through Treg-mediated tolerance that is not sustained indefinitely.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36977721,The predictive value of the nomogram model of clinical risk factors for ischemia-reperfusion injury after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a risk factor for poor clinical prognosis in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, due to the inability to predict the risk of its occurrence early, the effect of intervention measures is still being determined. This study intends to construct a nomogram prediction model and evaluate its value in predicting the risk of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The clinical admission data of 386 STEMI patients who underwent primary PCI were retrospectively analyzed. According to the degree of ST-segment resolution (STR), the patients were divided into the STR < 70% group (n = 197) and the STR > 70 group (n = 187). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to screen out IRI's admission-related clinical risk factors. The R language software was used to construct and verify the IRI nomogram prediction model based on the above indicators. The peak troponin level and the incidence of in-hospital death in the STR < 70% group were significantly higher than those in the STR > 70% group (p < 0.01), and the left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower than that in the STR > 70% group (p < 0.01). Combined with the results of LASSO regression and receiver operating characteristic curve comparison analysis, we constructed a six-dimensional nomogram predictive model: hypertension, anterior myocardial infarction, culprit vessel, proximal occlusion, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 3.85 mg/L, white blood cell count, neutrophil cell count, and lymphocyte count. The area under the nomogram's receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.779. The clinical decision curve found that the nomogram had good clinical applicability when the occurrence probability of IRI was between 0.23 and 0.95. The nomogram prediction model constructed based on six clinical factors at admission has good prediction efficiency and clinical applicability regarding the risk of IRI after primary PCI in patients with acute myocardial infarction.",[],2023-01-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36977670,Caspase 6/NR4A1/SOX9 signaling axis regulates hepatic inflammation and pyroptosis in ischemia-stressed fatty liver.,"The mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury has not been fully clarified. Caspase 6 is a critical regulator in innate immunity and host defense. We aimed to characterize the specific role of Caspase 6 in IR-induced inflammatory responses in fatty livers. Human fatty liver samples were harvested from patients undergoing ischemia-related hepatectomy to evaluate Caspase 6 expression. in mice model, we generated Caspase 6-knockout (Caspase 6KO) mice to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of macrophage Caspase 6 in IR-stimulated fatty livers. In human liver biopsies, Caspase 6 expression was upregulated combined with enhanced serum ALT level and severe histopathological injury in ischemic fatty livers. Moreover, Caspase 6 was mainly accumulated in macrophages but not hepatocytes. Unlike in controls, the Caspase 6-deficiency attenuated liver damage and inflammation activation. Activation of macrophage NR4A1 or SOX9 in Caspase 6-deficient livers aggravated liver inflammation. Mechanistically, macrophage NR4A1 co-localized with SOX9 in the nuclear under inflammatory conditions. Specifically, SOX9 acts as a coactivator of NR4A1 to directly target S100A9 transcription. Furthermore, macrophage S100A9 ablation dampened NEK7/NLRP3-driven inflammatory response and pyroptosis in macrophages. In conclusion, our findings identify a novel role of Caspase 6 in regulating NR4A1/SOX9 interaction in response to IR-stimulated fatty liver inflammation, and provide potential therapeutic targets for the prevention of fatty liver IR injury.",[],2023-01-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36977502,Injury Site Specific Xenon Delivered by Platelet Membrane-Mimicking Hybrid Microbubbles to Protect Against Acute Kidney Injury via Inhibition of Cellular Senescence.,"Inhalation of xenon gas improves acute kidney injury (AKI). However, xenon can only be delivered through inhalation, which causes non-specific distribution and low bioavailability of xenon, thus limiting its clinical application. In this study, xenon is loaded into platelet membrane-mimicking hybrid microbubbles (Xe-Pla-MBs). In ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI, intravenously injected Xe-Pla-MBs adhere to the endothelial injury site in the kidney. Xe-Pla-MBs are then disrupted by ultrasound, and xenon is released to the injured site. This release of xenon reduced ischemia-reperfusion-induced renal fibrosis and improved renal function, which are associated with decreased protein expression of cellular senescence markers p53 and p16, as well as reduced beta-galactosidase in renal tubular epithelial cells. Together, platelet membrane-mimicking hybrid microbubble-delivered xenon to the injred site protects against ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI, which likely reduces renal senescence. Thus, the delivery of xenon by platelet membrane-mimicking hybrid microbubbles is a potential therapeutic approach for AKI.","['acute kidney injury', 'cellular senescence', 'microbubbles', 'platelet membranes', 'xenon']",2022-12-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36977223,Risperidone Administration Attenuates Renal Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury following Cardiac Arrest by Antiinflammatory Effects in Rats.,"Multi-organ dysfunction following cardiac arrest is associated with poor outcome as well as high mortality. The kidney, one of major organs in the body, is susceptible to ischemia and reperfusion; however, there are few studies on renal ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI) following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest. Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, has been discovered to have some beneficial effects beyond its original effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate possible therapeutic effects of risperidone on renal IRI following cardiac arrest. Rats were subjected to cardiac arrest induced by asphyxia for five minutes followed by ROSC. When serum biochemical analyses were examined, the levels of serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase were dramatically increased after cardiac arrest, but they were significantly reduced by risperidone administration. Histopathology was examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histopathological injury induced by cardiac arrest was apparently attenuated by risperidone administration. Furthermore, alterations in pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-4 and interleukin-13) were examined by immunohistochemistry. Pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivities were gradually and markedly increased and decreased, respectively, in the kidneys following cardiac arrest; however, risperidone administration after cardiac arrest significantly attenuated the increased pro-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivities and the decreased anti-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivities. Collectively, our current results revealed that, in rats, risperidone administration after cardiac arrest protected kidneys from IRI induced by cardiac arrest and ROSC through anti-inflammatory effects.","['antipsychotic drug', 'blood urea nitrogen', 'creatinine', 'histopathology', 'inflammatory cytokines', 'lactate dehydrogenase']",2023-01-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36976495,Spatio-Temporal Characterization of Brain Inflammation in a Non-human Primate Stroke Model Mimicking Endovascular Thrombectomy.,"Reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke have demonstrated their efficacy in promoting clinical recovery. However, ischemia/reperfusion injury and related inflammation remain a major challenge in patient clinical management. We evaluated the spatio-temporal evolution of inflammation using sequential clinical [11C]PK11195 PET-MRI in a non-human primate (NHP) stroke model mimicking endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with a neuroprotective cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. The NHP underwent a 110-min transient endovascular middle cerebral artery occlusion. We acquired [11C]PK11195 dynamic PET-MR imaging at baseline, 7 and 30 days after intervention. Individual voxel-wise analysis was performed thanks to a baseline scan database. We quantified [11C]PK11195 in anatomical regions and in lesioned areas defined on per-occlusion MR diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion [15O2]H2OPET imaging. [11C]PK11195 parametric maps showed a clear uptake overlapping the lesion core at D7, which further increased at D30. Voxel-wise analysis identified individuals with significant inflammation at D30, with voxels located within the most severe diffusion reduction area during occlusion, mainly in the putamen. The quantitative analysis revealed that thalamic inflammation lasted until D30 and was significantly reduced in the CsA-treated group compared to the placebo. In conclusion, we showed that chronic inflammation matched ADC decrease at occlusion time, a region exposed to an initial burst of damage-associated molecular patterns, in an NHP stroke model mimicking EVT. We described secondary thalamic inflammation and the protective effect of CsA in this region. We propose that major ADC drop in the putamen during occlusion may identify individuals who could benefit from early personalized treatment targeting inflammation.","['Endovascular thrombectomy', 'Inflammation', 'PET-MRI', 'Stroke', 'TSPO']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36975887,The Role of ncRNAs in Cardiac Infarction and Regeneration.,"Myocardial infarction is the most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, and it is defined as cardiomyocyte cell death due to a lack of oxygen supply. Such a temporary absence of oxygen supply, or ischemia, leads to extensive cardiomyocyte cell death in the affected myocardium. Notably, reactive oxygen species are generated during the reperfusion process, driving a novel wave of cell death. Consequently, the inflammatory process starts, followed by fibrotic scar formation. Limiting inflammation and resolving the fibrotic scar are essential biological processes with respect to providing a favorable environment for cardiac regeneration that is only achieved in a limited number of species. Distinct inductive signals and transcriptional regulatory factors are key components that modulate cardiac injury and regeneration. Over the last decade, the impact of non-coding RNAs has begun to be addressed in many cellular and pathological processes including myocardial infarction and regeneration. Herein, we provide a state-of-the-art review of the current functional role of diverse non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), in different biological processes involved in cardiac injury as well as in distinct experimental models of cardiac regeneration.","['cardiac infarction', 'circRNAs', 'lncRNAs', 'miRNAs', 'regeneration']",2023-01-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36975867,Pharmacological Modulation by Low Molecular Weight Heparin of Purinergic Signaling in Cardiac Cells Prevents Arrhythmia and Lethality Induced by Myocardial Infarction.,"Although several studies suggest that heparins prevent arrhythmias caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. To investigate the involvement of pharmacological modulation of adenosine (ADO) signaling in cardiac cells by a low-molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin; ENOX) used in AMI therapy, the effects of ENOX on the incidences of ventricular arrhythmias (VA), atrioventricular block (AVB), and lethality (LET) induced by cardiac ischemia and reperfusion (CIR) were evaluated, with or without ADO signaling blockers.To induce CIR, adult male Wistar rats were anesthetized and subjected to CIR. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis was used to evaluate CIR-induced VA, AVB, and LET incidence, after treatment with ENOX. ENOX effects were evaluated in the absence or presence of an ADO A1-receptor antagonist (DPCPX) and/or an inhibitor of ABC transporter-mediated cAMP efflux (probenecid, PROB).VA incidence was similar between ENOX-treated (66%) and control rats (83%), but AVB (from 83% to 33%) and LET (from 75% to 25%) incidences were significantly lower in rats treated with ENOX. These cardioprotective effects were blocked by either PROB or DPCPX.These results indicate that ENOX was effective in preventing severe and lethal arrhythmias induced by CIR due to pharmacological modulation of ADO signaling in cardiac cells, suggesting that this cardioprotective strategy could be promising in AMI therapy.","['cardiac arrhythmias', 'cardiac ischemia/reperfusion', 'enoxaparin', 'low-molecular weight heparin', 'purinergic signaling']",2023-01-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36974993,Maslinic Acid Ameliorates Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury-Induced Oxidative Stress via Activating Nrf2 and Inhibiting NF-[Formula: see text]B Pathways.,"Maslinic acid (MA) is a pentacyclic triterpene obtained from the peel of olives that exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in several conditions. Our previous study revealed that MA exerted a cardioprotective effect by repressing inflammation and apoptosis during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). However, data regarding the antioxidative effects of MA on MIRI remains limited. This study aims to elucidate the antioxidative roles and underlying mechanisms of MA on MIRI. The left anterior descending coronary artery of rats was subjected to ligate for the induction of the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model and the H9c2 cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to mimic oxidative stress. The results showed that MA reduced the I/R-induced myocardial injury and H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte death in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, MA increased the activities of glutathione and superoxide dismutase both in vitro and in vivo while lowering the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. Mechanistically, MA could facilitate Nrf2 nuclear translocation, activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, and repress the NF-[Formula: see text]B signaling pathway both in I/R- and H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Besides, MA promoted the intranuclear Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which could in part be improved by QNZ (NF-[Formula: see text]B inhibitor) in H2O2-insulted cells. Conversely, MA markedly reduced the intranuclear NF-[Formula: see text]B p65 and TNF-[Formula: see text] expression, which could be partially abolished by ML385 (Nrf2 inhibitor). Overall, our results indicate that MA, in a dose-dependent manner, mitigated I/R-induced myocardial injury and oxidative stress via activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting NF-[Formula: see text]B activation. Furthermore, MA exerts its cardioprotective effect through regulating the crosstalk between the Nrf2 and NF-[Formula: see text]B pathways.","['Maslinic Acid', 'Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury', 'NF-[Formula: see text]B', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative Stress']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36974367,Dynamic Regulation of Ferroptosis by Lipid Metabolism.,"Significance: Ferroptosis is featured by the accumulation of polyunsaturated-lipid peroxidation on cellular membranes in an iron-dependent manner. Ferroptosis has been implicated in various pathophysiological processes, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemia-reperfusion tissue injury. However, our understanding about the dynamic and context-specific regulation of ferroptosis remains incomplete. Recent Advances: As the major substrate for peroxidation, the cellular lipidome regulates ferroptosis sensitivity and execution by controlling the abundance and availability of polyunsaturated-lipids for peroxidative modifications. In turn, the cellular lipidome is regulated by a complex network of enzymes and transporters, as well as upstream layers of receptors, kinases, and transcription factors. A number of research has shed light on the link between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis. Here, we summarize our current knowledge on the role of the lipidome and associated protein regulators in various stages of ferroptosis, ranging from initiation, execution to cell death evasion by cells experiencing ferroptotic stress. Critical Issues: This review provides an overview of the mechanisms underlying lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis by discussing the lipid species that directly contribute to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, how cells regulate the abundances of these pro-ferroptosis lipids, how lipid peroxidation causes cell death, and how cells prevent and repair membrane lipid damage under ferroptotic conditions. Future Directions: Cell fate regulation in vivo could be different from in vitro culture settings. We envision that a comprehensive and detailed understanding about these important questions in the dynamic regulation of ferroptosis in vivo will accelerate our development of ferroptosis-targeted therapies to improve human health.","['ferroptosis', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipid peroxidation', 'organelles', 'polyunsaturated-lipids']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

HE and Masson staining were performed to observe renal fibrosis. The protein abundance levels were measured along with inflammatory markers, renal complement C3. Podocytes were treated with C3a with or without Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) inhibitor. The effects of TLR4 up-regulation by TLR4 plasmids were examined.C3-/- resulted in amelioration of renal dysfunction by reducing podocyte damage and renal fibrosis. Immunoblot with renal tissue homogenates from IR-AKI mice revealed that C3-/- decreased TLR4/Nuclear Factor-κB (NFκB)-P65.Our results indicate that modulating C3/TLR4/NFκB-P65 signaling pathway is a novel therapeutic target for the IR-AKI and post-injury fibrosis.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Complement C3', 'Podocyte']",2022-08-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cerebrolysin (30 mL/day over 14 days) was administered concurrently with alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) in 126 patients, whereas 215 control patients received alteplase alone. The primary outcomes were the rate of any and symptomatic HT assessed from day 0 to 14. The secondary endpoints were drug safety and functional outcome measured with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on day 1 and 14, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) on day 90. Advanced brain imaging analysis was applied on day 1 and 14 as a marker for in vivo pharmacology of Cerebrolysin.Cerebrolysin treatment resulted in a substantial decrease of the symptomatic HT rate with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.248 (95% CI: 0.072-0.851; p = 0.019). No serious adverse events attributed to Cerebrolysin occurred. On day 14, the Cerebrolysin arm showed a significant decrease in the NIHSS score (p = 0.045). However, no difference in the mRS score was observed on day 90.

36972855,Protective effects of human amniotic membrane derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) secreted factors on mouse spermatogenesis and sperm chromatin condensation following unilateral testicular torsion.,"Testicular torsion is considered a urological disorder that requires immediate detorsion surgery. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury after testicular torsion detorsion causes of drastic impairment of spermatogenesis and infertility. Cell-free-based approaches seem to be a promising strategy to prevent I/R injury, they have more stable biological properties, and they contain paracrine factors of mesenchymal stem cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of human amniotic membrane derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) secreted factors on mouse sperm chromatin condensation and spermatogenesis improvement after I/R injury. hAMSCs were isolated and characterized by RT- PCR and flow cytometry, preparation of hAMSCs secreted factors was performed. Forty male mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham-operated, torsion detorsion, torsion detorsion+ intratesticular injection of DMEM/F-12, and torsion detorsion+ intratesticular injection of hAMSCs secreted factors. After one cycle of spermatogenesis, the mean number of germ cells, Sertoli, Leydig, myoid as well as tubular parameters, Johnson score, and spermatogenesis indexes were evaluated by H& E and PAS stainings. Sperm chromatin condensation and relative expression of c-kit and prm 1 genes were assessed by aniline blue staining and real-time PCR, respectively. The mean number of spermatogenic cells, Leydig, myoid, Sertoli, spermatogenesis parameters, Johnson score, as well as germinal epithelial height and diameters of seminiferous tubules decreased significantly after I/R injury. The thickness of basement membrane and percentage of sperm with excessive histone significantly increased, while the relative expression of c-kit and prm 1 significantly decreased in torsion detorsion group (p 0.001). hAMSCs secreted factors remarkably restored normal sperm chromatin condensation, spermatogenesis parameters and histomorphometric organization of seminiferous tubules via intratesticular injection (p 0.001).

This paper aims to evaluate the reno-protective effects of Quercetin in induced ischemia/reperfusion injury by regulating apoptosis-related proteins, inflammatory cytokines, MMP-2, MMP-9, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer inactivated B cells (NF-kB) in rats. The male Wistar rats (n=32) were randomly divided into Sham, untreated IR, and Quercetin-treated IR (gavage and intraperitoneal). Quercetin was given orally and intraperitoneally one hour before inducing ischemia-reperfusion injury . After reperfusion, blood samples and kidneys were collected to assess renal function and inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic signaling proteins, and antioxidants. Urea, creatinine, and MDA levels improved in Quercetin-treated groups with different administration methods. In addition, the activities of other antioxidant in Quercetin-treated rats were higher than those in the IR group. Further, Quercetin inhibited NF-kB signaling, apoptosis-associated factors and produced matrix metalloproteinase protein in the kidneys of rats. Based on the findings, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects of the Quercetin diminished renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rats significantly.

36971866,Regulatory effects of trimetazidine in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a tissue damage during reperfusion after an ischemic condition. I/R injury is induced by pathological cases including stroke, myocardial infarction, circulatory arrest, sickle cell disease, acute kidney injury, trauma, and sleep apnea. It can lead to increased morbidity and mortality in the context of these processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the hallmarks of I/R insult, which is induced via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, apoptosis, and autophagy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are non-coding RNAs that play a main regulatory role in gene expression. Recently, there are evidence, which miRNAs are the major modulators of cardiovascular diseases, especially myocardial I/R injury. Cardiovascular miRNAs, specifically miR-21, and probably miR-24 and miR-126 have protective effects on myocardial I/R injury. Trimetazidine (TMZ) is a new class of metabolic agents with an anti-ischemic activity. It has beneficial effects on chronic stable angina by suppressing mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. The present review study addressed the different mechanistic effects of TMZ on cardiac I/R injury. Online databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane library were assessed for published studies between 1986 and 2021. TMZ, an antioxidant and metabolic agent, prevents the cardiac reperfusion injury by regulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), cystathionine-γ-lyase enzyme (CSE)/hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and miR-21. Therefore, TMZ protects the heart against I/R injury by inducing key regulators such as AMPK, CSE/H2S, and miR-21.","['AMP-activated protein kinase', 'Cardiac', 'Ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'MiRNAs', 'Trimetazidine']",2022-10-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36971662,Nanomedicine-Based Therapeutics for Myocardial Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury.,"Myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (IR) injury is a global cardiovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. Therapeutic interventions for myocardial ischemia involve restoring the occluded coronary artery. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) inevitably impair the cardiomyocytes during the ischemic and reperfusion phases. Antioxidant therapy holds great promise against myocardial IR injury. The current therapeutic methodologies for ROS scavenging depend predominantly on administering antioxidants. Nevertheless, the intrinsic drawbacks of antioxidants limit their further clinical transformation. The use of nanoplatforms with versatile characteristics greatly benefits drug delivery in myocardial ischemic therapy. Nanoplatform-mediated drug delivery significantly improves drug bioavailability, increases therapeutic index, and reduces systemic toxicity. Nanoplatforms can be specifically and reasonably designed to enhance molecule accumulation at the myocardial site. The present review initially summarizes the mechanism of ROS generation during the process of myocardial ischemia. The understanding of this phenomenon will facilitate the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies against myocardial IR injury. The latest developments in nanomedicine for treating myocardial ischemic injury are then discussed.

Here, we assessed the metabolic alterations following subclinical focal ischemia-reperfusion injury with hyperpolarized [1-13 C]pyruvate MRI in a porcine model.Five pigs were subjected to 60 min of focal kidney ischemia. After 90 min of reperfusion, a multiparametric proton MRI protocol was performed on a clinical 3T scanner system. Metabolism was evaluated using 13 C MRI following infusion of hyperpolarized [1-13 C]pyruvate. Ratios of pyruvate to its detectable metabolites (lactate, bicarbonate, and alanine) were used to quantify metabolism.The focal ischemia-reperfusion injury resulted in injured areas with a mean size of 0.971 cm3 (±1.019). Compared with the contralateral kidney, the injured areas demonstrated restricted diffusion (1269 ± 83.59 × 10-6  mm2 /s vs. 1530 ± 52.73 × 10-6  mm2 /s; p = 0.006) and decreased perfusion (158.8 ± 29.4 mL/100 mL/min vs. 274 ± 63.1 mL/100 mL/min; p = 0.014). In the metabolic assessment, the injured areas displayed increased lactate/pyruvate ratios compared with the entire ipsilateral and the contralateral kidney (0.35 ± 0.13 vs. 0.27 ± 0.1 vs. 0.25 ± 0.1; p = 0.0086). Alanine/pyruvate ratio was unaltered, and we were unable to quantify bicarbonate due to low signal.MRI with hyperpolarized [1-13 C]pyruvate in a clinical setup is capable of detecting the acute, subtle, focal metabolic changes following ischemia.

Thrombotic diseases constitute a major cause of disability and mortality in adults, in which thrombosis and inflammation play a crucial role. Recently, increasing evidence demonstrates the distribution and function of this glycoprotein in thrombotic diseases such as atherosclerosis, ischemic stroke, venous thrombosis, ischemic-reperfusion injury (IRI) of kidney and liver, and myocardial infarction. Evidence showed that after ischemia, Pdpn can be acquired over time by a heterogeneous cell population, which may not express Pdpn in normal conditions.

36970418,Zinc accumulation aggravates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting inflammation.,"Intracellular zinc accumulation has been shown to be associated with neuronal death after cerebral ischemia. However, the mechanism of zinc accumulation leading to neuronal death in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is still unclear. Intracellular zinc signals are required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The present study investigated whether intracellular accumulated zinc aggravates I/R injury through inflammatory response, and inflammation-mediated neuronal apoptosis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or zinc chelator TPEN 15 mg/kg before a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The expressions of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, NF-κB p65, and NF-κB inhibitory protein IκB-α, as well as anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were assessed at 6 or 24 h after reperfusion. Our results demonstrated that the expression of TNF-α, IL-6, and NF-κB p65 increased after reperfusion, while the expression of IκB-α and IL-10 decreased, suggesting that cerebral ischemia triggers inflammatory response. Furthermore, TNF-α, NF-κB p65, and IL-10 were all colocalized with the neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), suggesting that the ischemia-induced inflammatory response occurs in neurons. Moreover, TNF-α was also colocalized with the zinc-specific dyes Newport Green (NG), suggesting that intracellular accumulated zinc might be associated with neuronal inflammation following cerebral I/R. Chelating zinc with TPEN reversed the expression of TNF-α, NF-κB p65, IκB-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in ischemic rats. Besides, IL-6-positive cells were colocalized with TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra of MCAO rats at 24 h after reperfusion, indicating that zinc accumulation following I/R might induce inflammation and inflammation-associated neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, this study demonstrates that excessive zinc activates inflammation and that the brain injury caused by zinc accumulation is at least partially due to specific neuronal apoptosis induced by inflammation, which may provide an important mechanism of cerebral I/R injury.","['apoptosis', 'cerebral ischemia', 'inflammation', 'middle cerebral artery occlusion', 'zinc']",2022-10-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36970136,Chronic mesenteric ischemia-induced intestinal dysbiosis resolved after revascularization.,"Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a debilitating condition arising from intestinal malperfusion from mesenteric artery stenosis or occlusion. Mesenteric revascularization has been the standard of care but can result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Most of the perioperative morbidity has been secondary to postoperative multiple organ dysfunction, potentially from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The intestinal microbiome is a dense community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract that help regulate pathways ranging from nutritional metabolism to the immune response. We hypothesized that patients with CMI will have microbiome perturbations that contribute to this inflammatory response and could potentially normalize in the postoperative period.We performed a prospective study of patients with CMI who had undergone mesenteric bypass and/or stenting from 2019 to 2020. Stool samples were collected at three time points: preoperatively at the clinic, perioperatively within 14 days after surgery, and postoperatively at the clinic at >30 days after revascularization. Stool samples from healthy controls were used for comparison. The microbiome was measured using 16S rRNA sequencing on an Illumina-MiSeq sequence platform and analyzed using the QIIME2 (quantitative insights into microbial ecology 2)-DADA2 bioinformatics pipeline with the Silva database. Beta-diversity was analyzed using a principal coordinates analysis and permutational analysis of variance. Alpha-diversity (microbial richness and evenness) was compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Microbial taxa unique to CMI patients vs controls were identified using linear discriminatory analysis effect size analysis. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.Eight patients with CMI had undergone mesenteric revascularization (25% men; average age, 71 years). Nine healthy controls were also analyzed (78% men; average age, 55 years). Bacterial alpha-diversity (number of operational taxonomic units) was dramatically reduced preoperatively compared with that of the controls (P = .03). However, revascularization partially restored the species richness and evenness in the perioperative and postoperative phases. Beta-diversity was only different between the perioperative and postoperative groups (P = .03). Further analyses revealed increased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Clostridia taxa preoperatively and perioperatively compared with the controls, which was reduced during the postoperative period.The results from the present study have shown that patients with CMI have intestinal dysbiosis that resolves after revascularization. The intestinal dysbiosis is characterized by the loss of alpha-diversity, which is restored perioperatively and maintained postoperatively. This microbiome restoration demonstrates the importance of intestinal perfusion to sustain gut homeostasis and suggests that microbiome modulation could be a possible intervention to ameliorate acute and subacute postoperative outcomes in these patients.","['Chronic mesenteric ischemia', 'Microbiota', 'Revascularization']",2022-09-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36969839,Cardioprotective effects of curcumin against myocardial I/R injury: A systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical and clinical studies.,"Objective: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a complex clinical problem that often leads to further myocardial injury. Curcumin is the main component of turmeric, which has been proved to have many cardioprotective effects. However, the cardioprotective potential of curcumin remains unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the clinical and preclinical (animal model) evidence regarding the effect of curcumin on myocardial I/R injury. Methods: Eight databases and three register systems were searched from inception to 1 November 2022. Data extraction, study quality assessment, data analyses were carried out strictly. Then a fixed or random-effects model was applied to analyze the outcomes. SYRCLE's-RoB tool and RoB-2 tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RevMan 5.4 software and stata 15.1 software were used for statistical analysis. Results: 24 animal studies, with a total of 503 animals, and four human studies, with a total of 435 patients, were included in this study. The meta-analysis of animal studies demonstrated that compared with the control group, curcumin significantly reduced myocardial infarction size (p < 0.00001), and improved the cardiac function indexes (LVEF, LVFS, LVEDd, and LVESd) (p < 0.01). In addition, the indexes of myocardial injury markers, myocardial oxidation, myocardial apoptosis, inflammation, and other mechanism indicators also showed the beneficial effect of curcumin (p < 0.05). In terms of clinical studies, curcumin reduced the incidence of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial infarction in the hospital and MACE in the short term, which might be related to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative property. Dose-response meta-analysis predicted, 200 mg/kg/d bodyweight was the optimal dose of curcumin in the range of 10-200 mg/kg/d, which was safe and non-toxic according to the existing publications. Conclusion: Our study is the first meta-analysis that includes both preclinical and clinical researches. We suggested that curcumin might play a cardioprotective role in acute myocardial infarction in animal studies, mainly through anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, and anti-fibrosis effects. In addition, from the clinical studies, we found that curcumin might need a longer course of treatment and a larger dose to protect the myocardium, and its efficacy is mainly reflected on reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction and MACE. Our finding provides some meaningful advice for the further research.","['clinical evidence', 'curcumin', 'myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI)', 'pre-clinical evidence', 'systematic review and meta-analysis']",2022-11-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36969346,"Efficacy of inhaled hydrogen on neurological outcome following brain ischaemia during post-cardiac arrest care (HYBRID II): a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","Inhaled molecular hydrogen gas (H2) has been shown to improve outcomes in animal models of cardiac arrest (CA). H2 inhalation is safe and feasible in patients after CA. We investigated whether inhaled H2 would improve outcomes after out-of-hospital CA (OHCA).HYBRID II is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed at 15 hospitals in Japan, between February 1, 2017, and September 30, 2021. Patients aged 20-80 years with coma following cardiogenic OHCA were randomly assigned (1:1) using blinded gas cylinders to receive supplementary oxygen with 2% H2 or oxygen (control) for 18 h. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a 90-day Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 1 or 2 assessed in a full-analysis set. Secondary outcomes included the 90-day score on a modified Rankin scale (mRS) and survival. HYBRID II was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network (registration number: UMIN000019820) and re-registered with the Japan Registry for Clinical Trials (registration number: jRCTs031180352).The trial was terminated prematurely because of the restrictions imposed on enrolment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between February 1, 2017, and September 30, 2021, 429 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 73 were randomly assigned to H2 (n = 39) or control (n = 34) groups. The primary outcome, i.e., a CPC of 1 or 2 at 90 days, was achieved in 22 (56%) and 13 (39%) patients in the H2 and control groups (relative risk compared with the control group, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.46-1.13; P = 0.15), respectively. Regarding the secondary outcomes, median mRS was 1 (IQR: 0-5) and 5 (1-6) in the H2 and control groups, respectively (P = 0.01). An mRS score of 0 was achieved in 18 (46%) and 7 (21%) patients in the H2 and control groups, respectively (P = 0.03). The 90-day survival rate was 85% (33/39) and 61% (20/33) in the H2 and control groups, respectively (P = 0.02).The increase in participants with good neurological outcomes following post-OHCA H2 inhalation in a selected population of patients was not statistically significant. However, the secondary outcomes suggest that H2 inhalation may increase 90-day survival without neurological deficits.Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation.For the Japanese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.","['Coma', 'Hydrogen inhalation', 'Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'Reperfusion injury']",2022-11-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36969321,Hypoxia-treated umbilical mesenchymal stem cell alleviates spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury in SCI by circular RNA circOXNAD1/ miR-29a-3p/ FOXO3a axis.,"Spinal cord ischemia reperfusion (SCIR) injury leads to spinal cord function injury, neural dysfunction and sometimes paralysis or even paraplegia, which severely impair the physical and mental health of individuals. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a group of stem cells that have been widely studied for treatment of various diseases. This work aimed to study the therapeutic potential of hypoxia-induced exosomal circular RNA OXNAD1 from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs) against SCIR. We established an in vivo rat spinal cord injury (SCI) model and conducted treatment with exosomes that isolated from hypoxia-HucMSCs. Hypoxia-HucMSCs-derived exosomal circOXNAD1 alleviated the spinal cord tissue injury in SCI, improved limb motor function, decreased production of inflammatory factors including the IL-1 β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The in vitro hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) model demonstrated that Hypoxia-HucMSCs-derived exosomal circOXNAD1 improved neuron proliferation and alleviated apoptosis. Mechanistically, circOXNAD1 directly interact with miR-29a-3p and miR-29a-3p targets the 3'UTR of FOXO3a in neurons. Inhibition of miR-29a-3p and overexpression of FOXO3a reversed the effects of circOXNAD1 depletion in PC12 cell phenotypes. In conclusion, Hypoxia elevated the level circOXNAD1 in exosomes that derived from HuMSCs. The exosomal circOXNAD1 alleviated SCI through sponging miR-29a-3p and consequently elevated the FOXO3a expression. Our findings provided novel evidence for MSC-derived exosomal circOXNAD1in the treatment of SCI.","['Exosomes', 'FOXO3', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Mesenchymal stem cell', 'Spinal cord injury', 'circOXNAD1', 'miR-29a-3p']",2022-11-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36968831,Oxypurinol protects renal ischemia/reperfusion injury via heme oxygenase-1 induction.,"Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) by increasing oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and tubular cell death. Oxypurinol, an active metabolite of allopurinol, is a potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent. To investigate the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanism of oxypurinol in ischemic AKI, C57BL/6 male mice were intraperitoneally injected with oxypurinol and subjected to renal I/R or sham surgery. We found that oxypurinol-treated mice had lower plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels and tubular damage (hematoxylin-and-eosin staining) compared to vehicle-treated mice after renal I/R injury. Furthermore, oxypurinol treatment reduced kidney inflammation (i.e., neutrophil infiltration and MIP-2 mRNA induction), oxidative stress (i.e., 4-HNE, heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1], 8-OHdG expression, and Catalase mRNA induction), and apoptosis (i.e., TUNEL or cleaved caspase-3-positive renal tubular cells), compared to vehicle-treated mice. Mechanistically, oxypurinol induced protein expressions of HO-1, which is a critical cytoprotective enzyme during ischemic AKI, and oxypurinol-mediated protection against ischemic AKI was completely eliminated by pretreatment with tin protoporphyrin IX, an HO-1 inhibitor. In conclusion, oxypurinol protects against renal I/R injury by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis via HO-1 induction, suggesting its preventive potential in ischemic AKI.","['acute kidney injury', 'apoptosis', 'oxidative damage', 'oxypurinol', 'renal ischemia/reperfusion']",2022-08-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36967627,Functional analysis of hepatic long non-coding ribonucleic acids during liver transplantation in humans.,"The potential function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) remains to be clarified.Clinical samples of transplanted liver tissues from 26 patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) and normal liver tissues from seven patients undergoing hepatic hemangiomactomy (Con) were collected. Typical samples were subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). Differentially expressed genes between groups were identified by DEGseq and were analyzed by enrichment analysis including Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and gene set enrichment analysis. Transcription of five lncRNAs including NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, NONHSAG027516, LXLOC_058190, and LXLOC_024376 that presented significant difference in RNA-sequencing were validated by a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), for which the subcellular localization and the binding ability to known human RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were respectively predicted by LncLocator and catRAPID genomics v2.1.We identified 2917 lncRNAs and 2811 mRNAs that were differentially expressed (p < 0.05 and log2 fold change > 1 or < -1) between groups (LT vs. Con). NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, LXLOC_058190, and LXLOC_024376 were validated by qRT-PCR to be significantly increased in the LT group, and were all predicted to be localized in cytoplasm or cytosol. NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, and LXLOC_058190 held an RBP interaction propensity score of 98.07%, 76.95%, and 152.99%, respectively, with heterogeneous-nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (HNRNPU). Pathways significantly activated in transplant livers that involved HNRNPU as a core enrichment gene included hypoxia, ACE2 expression, apoptosis, spliceosome formation, etc. CONCLUSIONS: NONHSAG039942, NONHSAG071405, and LXLOC_058190 were significantly increased in transplant livers after reperfusion and their role in HIRI may be associated with HNRNPU, a core protein that participates in hypoxia and chromatin accessibility.","['bioinformatics', 'heterogeneous-nuclear ribonucleoprotein U', 'liver transplantation', 'long non-coding RNAs', 'reperfusion injury', 'whole transcriptome sequencing']",2022-12-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36967457,Characteristics of acid-sensing ion channel currents in male rat muscle dorsal root ganglion neurons following ischemia/reperfusion.,"Peripheral artery diseases (PAD) increases muscle afferent nerve-activated reflex sympathetic nervous and blood pressure responses during exercise (termed as exercise pressor reflex). However, the precise signaling pathways leading to the exaggerated autonomic responses in PAD are undetermined. Considering that limb ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a feature of PAD, we determined the characteristics of acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) currents in muscle dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons under the conditions of hindlimb I/R and ischemia of PAD. In particular, we examined ASIC currents in two distinct subpopulations, isolectin B4 -positive, and B4 -negative (IB4+ and IB4-) muscle DRG neurons, linking to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor. In results, ASIC1a- and ASIC3-like currents were observed in IB4- muscle DRG neurons with a greater percentage of ASIC3-like currents. Hindimb I/R and ischemia did not alter the distribution of ASIC1a and ASIC3 currents with activation of pH 6.7 in IB4+ and IB4- muscle DRG neurons; however, I/R altered the distribution of ASIC3 currents in IB4+ muscle DRG neurons with pH 5.5, but not in IB4- neurons. In addition, I/R and ischemia amplified the density of ASIC3-like currents in IB4- muscle DRG neurons. Our results suggest that a selective subpopulation of muscle afferent nerves should be taken into consideration when ASIC signaling pathways are studied to determine the exercise pressor reflex in PAD.","['acid-sensing ion channels', 'dorsal root ganglion', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'peripheral artery disease']",2023-03-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36967397,Anti-CHAC1 exosomes for nose-to-brain delivery of miR-760-3p in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury mice inhibiting neuron ferroptosis.,"Ferroptosis plays a critical role in ischemic stroke, and anti-ferroptosis strategies were regarded as potentially effective measures. Based on ferroptosis-related mechanisms, this study aims to design and prepare anti-ferroptosis exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSC-Exo) for treating ischemic brain injury via intranasal (IN) administration. According to the bioinformatic analysis, CHAC1 was a key gene in the progress of ferroptosis in ischemic stroke. miR-760-3p can inhibit the expression of CHAC1 and may be abundant in ADSC-Exo. Therefore, ADSC-Exo were successfully isolated and the immunofluorescence showed that they can be efficiently delivered to the brain via IN administration. Additionally, IN administration of ADSC-Exo can effectively improve the neurobehavior function of mice after I/R, and improve the ferroptosis-related outcomes. As the immunofluorescence showed the co-localization of NeuN with CHAC1 obviously, we further evaluated the systematic effect of ADSC-Exo in an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2a model. The results showed that miR-760-3p in ADSC-Exo contributed to their function in inhibiting ferroptosis by targeting CHAC1 in neurons. Collectively, the present study successfully designed and prepared anti-CHAC1 ADSC-Exo and suggested a promising exosome-based strategy for anti-ferroptosis therapy in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.","['CHAC1', 'Cerebral ischemia', 'Exosomes', 'Ferroptosis', 'Intranasal administration']",2022-12-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36966916,Exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells can attenuate liver injury caused by minimally invasive hemihepatectomy combined with ischemia-reperfusion in minipigs by modulating the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) impairs postoperative recovery of liver function after liver resection or transplantation. It is crucial to minimize liver injury during surgery in order to improve patient survival and quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes from adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs-exo) against hepatectomy combined with IRI injury and compare that with the effect of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs).Minimally invasive hemihepatectomy combined with hepatic IRI was established in minipigs. A single dose of ADSCs-exo, ADSCs or PBS was injected through the portal vein. The histopathological features and function of the liver, and the oxidative stress levels, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ultrastructure and ER stress (ERS) response were analyzed pre- and postoperatively.ADSCs-exo alleviated the histopathological injuries and ultrastructural changes in the ER, and significantly improved ALP, TP and CAT levels. Furthermore, ADSCs-exo treatment also downregulated ERS-related factors such as GRP78, ATF6, IRE1α/XBP1, PERK/eIF2α/ATF4, JNK and CHOP. The therapeutic effects of ADSCs-exo and ADSCs were similar.Intravenous administration of a single dose of ADSCs-exo is a novel cell-free therapeutic approach to improve surgery-related liver injury. Our findings provide evidence of the paracrine effect of ADSCs and an experimental basis for treating liver injury with ADSCs-exo instead of ADSCs.","['Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'Exosomes', 'Hepatectomy', 'Ischemia reperfusion', 'Mesenchymal stem cells', 'Pig']",2023-02-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36966098,[Cytosteatonecrosis after breast reconstruction by fat flap with or without ischemic preconditioning].,"Cytosteatonecrosis (CTN) is a frequent postoperative complication after breast autologous reconstruction using DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap. CTN radiological diagnostic reveals different types of lesions, as nodes or extended fat necrosis, which become in some cases infected, or pass for tumor recurrence after breast cancer treatment. CTN is caused by intraoperative ischemia of the flap, and no current method can prevent postoperative CTN development after DIEP breast reconstruction. Mechanical ischemic preconditioning, consisting in intraoperative briefs consecutive cycles of ischemia reperfusion using vascular clamp upon the graft pedicle, is used in transplantation surgery. This procedure improves the graft tolerance towards ischemic surgical lesions. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to assess PCIM effects on CTN development after DIEP surgery, comparing CTN occurrence after breast reconstruction using DIEP flap with or without intraoperative PCIM.All patients breats reconstructed using DIEP flap between novembre 2020 and may 2022, presenting 6 months postoperative breast echography were retrospectively included. Primary outcome was the ultrasonic existence of CTN, according to the Wagner classification. Clinical data, postoperative outcomes such as infection, hematoma or surgical revision, and length of stay in hospital were also recorded.Twenty nine patients among which 8 PCIM were included. CTN occurrence rate after PCIM (25%) was quite lower than CTN rate without PCIM (71,4%), although the difference was not significant (P=0,088). Other postoperative complications rates were not significantly different with or without PCIM.PCIM seems to improve CTN occurrence after DIEP breast reconstruction, improving fat flap tolerance to ischemic perioperative lesions. Those preliminary results need to be confirmed with clinical prospective study.","['Cytosteatonecrose', 'Cytosteatonecrosis', 'DIEP', 'Free flap', 'Ischemia reperfusion', 'Ischemic preconditioning', 'Ischémie reperfusion', 'Lambeau libre', 'Préconditionnement ischémique']",2023-01-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36966096,Effect of ischemic preconditioning on skeletal tissue tolerance after warm venous ischemia.,"Free muscular flaps are commonly used in plastic surgery. The main reason of failure is thrombosis induced by a phenomenon called ischemia reperfusion. Preconditioning showed an interest to prevent ischemia reperfusion injury in transplantation surgery. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of ischemic preconditioning on skeletal tissue tolerance after warm venous ischemia.We realized an experimental study with latissimus dorsi flaps of 12 pigs, divided in 6 groups in function of their time of preconditioning and duration of warm venous ischemia. A morphologic analysis was performed measuring cell's diameter and interstitial tissue area and notifying the presence or absence of neutrophils, necrosis or intravascular thrombosis. To detect inflammation, necrosis or hypoxia, immunohistochemistry was effectuated using the follow primary antibodies, AIF, HIF1 alpha, caspase 3, SOD 1 and PKC epsilon. TUNEL assay showed apoptosis cells, were realized. One way Anova test was performed to compare the quantitative evolution over time of histological parameters and rate of apoptosis.Preconditioning of 40min or 1hour allowed to reduced ischemia reperfusion lesions: no cellular or interstitial oedema, reduction of neutrophils infiltrate and intravascular thrombus. TUNEL assay showed a higher rate of apoptosis nucleus for the control group E compared to preconditioning group C and D. Immunohistochemistry results were no relevant.We showed a diminution of lesions of ischemia reperfusion for experimental groups with preconditioning: diminution of interstitial oedema, of cellular oedema, diminution of neutrophils infiltrated and level of apoptosis cells. Preconditioning of 40minutes were as efficient as one hour.","['Free flap', 'Ischemia reperfusion', 'Ischemic preconditioning', 'Ischémie chaude veineuse', 'Ischémie reperfusion', 'Lambeau libre', 'Préconditionnement ischémique', 'Warm venous ischemia']",2023-01-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36966053,Microfluidic encapsulation of photosynthetic cyanobacteria in hydrogel microparticles augments oxygen delivery to rescue ischemic myocardium.,"Cardiovascular disease, primarily caused by coronary artery disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States. While standard clinical interventions have improved patient outcomes, mortality rates associated with eventual heart failure still represent a clinical challenge. Macrorevascularization techniques inadequately address the microvascular perfusion deficits that persist beyond primary and secondary interventions. In this work, we investigate a photosynthetic oxygen delivery system that rescues the myocardium following acute ischemia. Using a simple microfluidic system, we encapsulated Synechococcus elongatus into alginate hydrogel microparticles (HMPs), which photosynthetically deliver oxygen to ischemic tissue in the absence of blood flow. We demonstrate that HMPs improve the viability of S. elongatus during the injection process and allow for simple oxygen diffusion. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 45) underwent sham surgery, acute ischemia reperfusion surgery, or a chronic ischemia reperfusion surgery, followed by injection of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), S. elongatus suspended in PBS, HMPs, or S. elongatus encapsulated in HMPs. Treatment with S. elongatus-HMPs mitigated cellular apoptosis and improved left ventricular function. Thus, delivery of S. elongatus encapsulated in HMPs improves clinical translation by utilizing a minimally invasive delivery platform that improves S. elongatus viability and enhances the therapeutic benefit of a novel photosynthetic system for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.","['Hydrogel', 'Ischemia reperfusion', 'Microfluidics', 'Microparticles', 'Oxygen delivery']",2022-10-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36964845,Nogo-A Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress During Myocardial Ischemic-Reperfusion Injury in Diabetic Rats.,"Among the three isoforms encoded by neurite outgrowth inhibitor proteins has been intensely investigated as a central nervous system inhibitor. Although neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein-A (Nogo-A) expression is increased in plasma of patients who have experienced a coronary heart disease, its role in heart disease is not well elucidated. In this study, we discovered a significant increase in Nogo-A expression in diabetic myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury conditions. Accelerated Nogo-A and MI/R injury in diabetic rats was attenuated by tauroursodeoxycholic acid treatment and knockdown of Nogo-A per se is sufficient to decrease endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as well as prevents cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We hypothesized that decreased Nogo-A levels might reducing diabetic MI/R injury. Nogo-A interacted with C/EBP homologous protein, suggesting a role for Nogo-A in ER stress during diabetic MI/R. In conclusion, Nogo-A mediated ER stress plays a major role in diabetic MI/R injury, and pathologically altered Nogo-A expression mediates diabetic MI/R injury, suggesting Nogo-A as a novel target for the treatment of diabetic MI/R injury in clinical settings.","['Diabetes', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury']",2022-07-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36964632,Overexpression of HSF2 binding protein suppresses endoplasmic reticulum stress via regulating subcellular localization of CDC73 in hepatocytes.,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in the occurrence and development of various liver diseases. However, there are no effective prevention and treatment strategies. We aimed to determine the role of heat shock factor 2 binding protein (HSF2BP) in ER stress.HSF2BP expression in mice and cultured hepatocytes was measured during ER stress induced by tunicamycin, and its importance in ER stress was evaluated in hepatocyte-specific HSF2BP transgenic (TG) and knockout (KO) mice. The effects and mechanisms of HSF2BP on ER stress were further probed in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.HSF2BP expression was significantly upregulated during tunicamycin-induced ER stress in mice and cultured hepatocytes. Liver injury and ER stress were reduced in HSF2BP overexpressing mice after treating with tunicamycin, but were aggravated in HSF2BP knockout mice compared to the controls. In hepatic I/R injury, HSF2BP expression was significantly upregulated, and HSF2BP overexpressing mice had reduced liver injury and inflammation. These improvements were associated with ER stress inhibition. However, these results were reversed in hepatocyte-specific HSF2BP knockout mice. HSF2BP overexpression increased cytoplasmic CDC73 levels and inhibited the JNK signaling pathway. CDC73 knockdown using siRNA eliminated the protection exerted by HSF2BP overexpression in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced ER stress in hepatocytes.HSF2BP is a previously uncharacterized regulatory factor in ER stress-likely acts by regulating CDC73 subcellular localization. The feasibility of HSF2BP-targeted treatment in ER stress-related liver disease deserves future research.","['CDC73', 'ER stress', 'HSF2BP', 'Hepatic I/R injury']",2022-11-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36964482,Adenosine 2 receptor regulates autophagy and apoptosis to alleviate ischemia reperfusion injury in type 2 diabetes via IRE-1 signaling.,"This study aimed to determine the effect and mechanism of action of adenosine 2 receptor (A2R) activation on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) under diabetic conditions.MIRI type 2 diabetic rats and H9C2 cardiomyocytes were treated with A2R agonist and then subjected to hypoxia for 6 h and reoxygenation for 18 h. Myocardial damage, and infarct size were determined by cardiac ultrasound. Indicators of cardiomyocyte injury, creatine kinase-MB and cardiac troponin I were detected by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) was determined through measuring the expression levels of ERS related genes GRP78, p-IRE1/IRE1, and p-JNKJNK. The mechanism of A2R cardio protection in MIRI through regulating ERS induced autophagy was determined by investigating the ER resident protein IRE-1. The ER-stress inducer Tunicamycin, and the IRE-1 inhibitor STF in combination with the A2R agonist NECA were used, and the cellular responses were assessed through autophagy proteins expression Beclin-1, p62, LC3 and apoptosis.NECA improved left ventricular function post MIRI, limited myocardial infarct size, reduced myocardial damage, decreased cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and attenuated ERS induced autophagy through regulating the IRE-XBP1s-CHOP pathway. These actions resulted into overall protection of the myocardium against MIRI.In summary, A2R activation by NECA prior to ischemia attenuates apoptosis, reduces ERS induced autophagy and restores left ventricular function. This protective effect occurs through regulating the IRE1-XBPs-CHOP related mechanisms. NECA is thus a potential target for the treatment of MIRI in patient with type 2 diabetes.","['Adenosine2 receptor', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Reperfusion']",2022-10-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36963842,Bridging Thrombolysis Before Endovascular Therapy in Stroke Patients With Faster Core Growth.,"It is still uncertain that going direct to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) leads to equivalent outcomes as bridging IV thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic patients. This study aimed to explore whether the rate of ischemic core growth influenced the patient outcomes after bridging IVT vs direct EVT.This was a retrospective cohort study based on the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE). It selected acute ischemic stroke patients receiving perfusion CT within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. Patients who went direct to EVT were compared with those who received bridging treatment of IVT before EVT. Ischemic core growth rate was estimated by the acute ischemic core volume on perfusion CT divided by the time from stroke onset to perfusion CT, based on the assumption of a linear growth pattern of ischemic core. Core growth rate was stratified into fast (>15 mL/h) and slow (≤15 mL/h), based on its interaction with bridging IVT in predicting the primary outcome. The primary outcome was modified Rankin scale of 0-2 at 3 months. The secondary outcomes included successful thrombectomy reperfusion defined by modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b-3 and time from groin puncture to reperfusion.Of the 1,221 EVT patients in the INSPIRE, 323 patients were selected, of which 82 patients received direct EVT and 241 patients received bridging IVT. Bridging IVT was associated with a higher rate of good clinical outcome among patients with fast core growth (39% vs 7% for direct EVT, odds ratio [OR] 8.75 [1.96-39.1], p = 0.005), but the difference was not notable for patients with slow core growth (55% vs 55% for direct EVT, OR 1.00 [0.53-1.87], p = 0.989). In patients with fast core growth, the bridging and direct EVT patients showed no difference in the reperfusion rate (80% vs 76%, p = 0.616). However, patients who received bridging IVT were more likely to achieve reperfusion earlier (the median groin to reperfusion time of 63.0 vs 94.0 minutes, p = 0.005).Patients with fast core growth were more likely to benefit from bridging IVT. This is likely because prior IVT facilitates clot removal and thus reduces time to reperfusion.",[],2022-09-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36963615,Calponin 2 harnesses metabolic reprogramming to determine kidney fibrosis.,"In the fibrotic kidneys, the extent of a formed deleterious microenvironment is determined by cellular mechanical forces. This process requires metabolism for energy. However, how cellular mechanics and metabolism are connected remains unclear.A multi-disciplinary approach was employed: the fibrotic kidney disease models were induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury and unilateral ureteral obstruction in Calponin 2 (CNN2) knockdown mice. Proteomics, bioinformatics, and in vivo and in vitro molecular experimental pathology studies were performed.Our proteomics revealed that actin filament binding and cell metabolism are the two most dysregulated events in the fibrotic kidneys. As a prominent actin stabilizer, CNN2 was predominantly expressed in fibroblasts and pericytes. In CKD patients, CNN2 levels was markedly induced in blood. In mice, CNN2 knockdown preserves kidney function and alleviates fibrosis. Global proteomics profiled that CNN2 knockdown enhanced the activities of the key rate-limiting enzymes and regulators of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the diseased kidneys. Inhibiting carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α in the FAO pathway resulted in lipid accumulation and extracellular matrix deposition in the fibrotic kidneys, which were restored after CNN2 knockdown. Bioinformatics and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that CNN2 interactor, estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2), binds peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) to transcriptionally regulate FAO downstream target genes expression amid kidney fibrosis. In vitro, ESR2 knockdown repressed the mRNA levels of PPARα and the key genes in the FAO pathway. Conversely, activation of PPARα reduced CNN2-induced matrix inductions.Our results suggest that balancing cell mechanics and metabolism is crucial to develop therapeutic strategies to halt kidney fibrosis.","['Calponin 2', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'ESR2', 'Fatty acid oxidation', 'Proteomics']",2023-01-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36963487,DNA binding protein YB-1 is a part of the neutrophil extracellular trap mediation of kidney damage and cross-organ effects.,"Open-heart surgery is associated with high morbidity, with acute kidney injury (AKI) being one of the most commonly observed postoperative complications. Following open-heart surgery, in an observational study we found significantly higher numbers of blood neutrophils in a group of 13 patients with AKI compared to 25 patients without AKI (AKI: 12.9±5.4 ×109 cells/L; non-AKI: 10.1±2. 9 ×109 cells/L). Elevated serum levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) components, such as dsDNA, histone 3, and DNA binding protein Y-box protein (YB)-1, were found within the first 24 hours in patients who later developed AKI. We could demonstrate that NET formation and hypoxia triggered the release of YB-1, which was subsequently shown to act as a mediator of kidney tubular damage. Experimentally, in two models of AKI mimicking kidney hypoperfusion during cardiac surgery (bilateral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration), a neutralizing YB-1 antibody was administered to mice. In both models, prophylactic YB-1 antibody administration significantly reduced the tubular damage (damage score range 1-4, the LPS model: non-specific IgG control, 0.92±0.23; anti-YB-1 0.65±0.18; and in the I/R model: non-specific IgG control 2.42±0.23; anti-YB-1 1.86±0.44). Even in a therapeutic, delayed treatment model, antagonism of YB-1 ameliorated AKI (damage score, non-specific IgG control 3.03±0.31; anti-YB-1 2.58±0.18). Thus, blocking extracellular YB-1 reduced the effects induced by hypoxia and NET formation in the kidney and significantly limited AKI, suggesting that YB-1 is part of the NET formation process and an integral mediator of cross-organ effects.","['NETs', 'Y-box protein 1', 'YB-1 antagonism', 'postoperative AKI']",2022-11-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36963288,Git1-PGK1 interaction achieves self-protection against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury by modulating Keap1/Nrf2 signaling.,"Spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (SCIRI) is a significant secondary injury that causes damage to spinal cord neurons, leading to the impairment of spinal cord sensory and motor functions. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is considered one critical mechanism of neuron damage in SCIRI. Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance of neurons to ROS remain elusive. Our study revealed that the deletion of Git1 in mice led to poor recovery of spinal cord motor function after SCIRI. Furthermore, we discovered that Git1 has a beneficial effect on neuron resistance to ROS production. Mechanistically, Git1 interacted with PGK1, regulated PGK1 phosphorylation at S203, and affected the intermediate products of glycolysis in neurons. The influence of Git1 on glycolysis regulates the dimerization of Keap1, which leads to changes in Nrf2 ubiquitination and plays a role in resisting ROS. Collectively, we show that Git1 regulates the Keap1/Nrf2 axis to resist ROS in a PGK1-dependent manner and thus is a potential therapeutic target for SCIRI.",[],2023-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36959973,Effects of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction in Elderly Patients with Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy.,"We hypothesized that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) could improve postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC).Eighty-eight patients were randomly assigned to either the control or the RIPC group. The RIPC was applied on the right upper limb using a blood pressure cuff inflating 200 mmHg, consisting of 3 cycles of 5 min ischemia and 5 min reperfusion. Serum concentrations of Neuron-specific Enolase (NSE) and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were collected at one-day preoperative (T0), at the end of the operation (T4) and one-day postoperative (T5). Z score was tested at T0 and 3 days after the operation (T6). POCD was determined if there were two Z scores ≥1.96 at the same time or an average Z score ≥1.96.There was no significant difference in the Z score of each test between the two groups at T0 (P > 0.05). Notably, the duration of Stroop test C was significantly shorter in the RIPC group than that in the Control group at T6 (P = 0.01). POCD occurred in 1/44 (2.3%) patients in the RIPC group and 8/44 (18.2%) patients in the control group at T6 (P=0.035). In addition, serum NSE concentration was significantly decreased, but serum BDNF concentration was increased compared with the control group at T4 and T5 (P<0.001).RIPC could reduce the incidence of POCD in elderly patients after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","['elderly patients', 'postoperative cognitive dysfunction', 'regional cerebral oxygen saturation', 'remote ischemic preconditioning']",2022-12-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36959603,Suxiao Jiuxin Pill alleviates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through the ALKBH5/GSK3β/mTOR pathway.,"Many studies have shown effective protection from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) in animal models, but few, if any, treatments have yielded a substantial reduction in clinical. Several studies showed significant therapeutic effects for the Chinese patent medicine Suxiao Jiuxin Pill (SJP) in MIRI, although the specific molecular mechanisms remain undefined. Recently, increasing evidence indicates an important role for m6A modification in autophagy regulation in MIRI, and SJP has not been investigated in this regard.In vivo experiments were performed in a Wistar rat MIRI model. In vitro assays were conducted in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-treated H9c2 cells. H9c2 cells with ALKBH5 and GSK3β silencing were constructed by lentivirus transfection. TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assays were carried out for apoptosis detection. Then, m6A modification was detected with the EpiQuik m6A RNA methylation quantification kit, and GFP-RFP-LC3B was used to observe dynamic changes in autophagy. The autophagosome structure was assessed by Transmission electron microscopy. qPCR and immunoblot were performed for mRNA and protein analyses, receptively.SJP significantly mitigated MIRI in rats, reducing infarct size and myocardial apoptosis, and improving left ventricular function. In addition, SJP inhibited autophagy through the GSK3β/mTOR pathway in MIRI rats. In cultured H9c2 cells, SJP significantly inhibited H/R- related apoptosis and autophagic activity through the GSK3β/mTOR pathway. Additionally, SJP enhanced ALKBH5 expression in H/R cardiomyocytes, which is important in impaired m6A modification. Interestingly, ALKBH5 knockdown enhanced autophagy and apoptosis in H/R-induced cells, whereas SJP reversed these effects. Further experiments showed that autophagic activity and apoptosis enhanced by ALKBH5 deficiency are GSK3β/mTOR pathway dependent in H/R-treated H9c2 cells. After SJP administration the above effects were alleviated, suggesting SJP inhibited autophagy through the ALKBH5/GSK3β/mTOR pathway in H/R-induced cardiomyocytes. These effects of SJP were common to its two main constituents, including tetra-methylpyrazine (TMP) and borneol (BOR).SJP improves MIRI in rats and alleviates autophagy and apoptosis in H9c2 cells through the ALKBH5/GSK3β/mTOR pathway, thanks to its two major constituents TMP and BOR.","['ALKBH5/GSK3β/mTOR pathway', 'Autophagy', 'Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Suxiao Jiuxin pill']",2022-11-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36958801,Outcomes with Endovascular Treatment of Patients with M2 Segment MCA Occlusion in the Late Time Window.,"Randomized trials in the late window have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy in large-vessel occlusions. Patients with M2-segment MCA occlusions were excluded from these trials. We compared outcomes with endovascular thrombectomy in patients with M2-versus-M1 occlusions presenting 6-24 hours after symptom onset.Analyses were on pooled data from studies enrolling patients with stroke treated with endovascular thrombectomy 6-24 hours after symptom onset. We compared 90-day functional independence (mRS ≤ 2), mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and successful reperfusion (expanded TICI = 2b-3) between patients with M2 and M1 occlusions. The benefit of successful reperfusion was then assessed among patients with M2 occlusion.Of 461 patients, 367 (79.6%) had M1 occlusions and 94 (20.4%) had M2 occlusions. Patients with M2 occlusions were older and had lower median baseline NIHSS scores. Patients with M2 occlusion were more likely to achieve 90-day functional independence than those with M1 occlusion (adjusted OR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.25-3.65). There were no significant differences in the proportion of successful reperfusion (82.9% versus 81.1%) or mortality (11.2% versus 17.2%). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage risk was lower in patients with M2-versus-M1 occlusions (4.3% versus 12.2%, P = .03). Successful reperfusion was independently associated with functional independence among patients with M2 occlusions (adjusted OR = 2.84; 95% CI, 1.11-7.29).In the late time window, patients with M2 occlusions treated with endovascular thrombectomy achieved better clinical outcomes, similar reperfusion, and lower symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates compared with patients with M1 occlusion. These results support the safety and benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with M2 occlusions in the late window.",[],2022-10-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36958533,Clinical profile and prognosis of young patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction managed by the emergency-intervention Codi IAM network.,"Data on the clinical profile and outcomes of younger patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is scarce. This study compared clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients aged<45 years and those aged ≥ 45 years with STEMI managed by the acute myocardial infarction code (AMI Code) network. Sex-based differences in the younger cohort were also analyzed.This multicenter study collected individual data from the Catalonian AMI Code network. Between 2015 and 2020, we enrolled patients with an admission diagnosis of STEMI. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality within 30 days, 1 year, and 2 years.Overall, 18 933 patients (23% female) were enrolled. Of them, 1403 participants (7.4%) were aged<45 years. Younger patients with STEMI were more frequently smokers (P<.001) and presented with cardiac arrest and TIMI flow 0 before pPCI (P<.05), but the time from first medical contact to wire crossing was shorter than in the older group (P<.05). All-cause mortality rates were lower in patients aged<45 years (P<.001). Among younger patients, cardiogenic shock was most prevalent in women than in their male counterparts (P=.002), with the time from symptom onset to reperfusion being longer (P<.05). Compared with men aged<45 years, younger women were less likely to undergo pPCI (P=.004).Despite showing high-risk features on admission, young patients exhibit better outcomes than older patients. Differences in ischemia times and treatment were observed between men and women.","['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Coronary artery disease', 'Diferencias por sexo', 'Enfermedad coronaria', 'IAMCEST', 'Infarto agudo de miocardio', 'Pacientes jóvenes', 'STEMI', 'Sex gap', 'Younger patients']",2022-11-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36958437,TRIM21 ubiquitylates GPX4 and promotes ferroptosis to aggravate ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury.,"This study aims to verify the molecular mechanism that Tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21) promotes ubiquitination degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) by regulating ferroptosis, and to discuss the feasibility of TRIM21 as a new therapeutic target for acute kidney injury (AKI).Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-AKI model was constructed using Trim21+/+ and Trim21-/- mice, and the expression of markers associated with kidney injury and ferroptosis were evaluated. HK-2 cells were treated by RSL3 and Erastin, and a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model was constructed to simulate I/R injury in vivo.In vivo, TRIM21 is highly expressed in I/R kidney tissues. Loss of TRIM21 alleviated I/R-AKI and improved renal function. The upregulation of GPX4, a key ferroptosis regulator, and the mild mitochondrial damage suggested that loss of TRIM21 had a negative regulation of ferroptosis. In vitro, TRIM21 was highly expressed in H/R models, and overexpression of TRIM21 in HK-2 cells increased ROS production, promoted intracellular iron accumulation, and boosted cellular sensitivity to RSL3 and Erastin. Mechanistically, we confirmed that GPX4 is a substrate of TRIM21 and can be degraded by TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination, suggesting that inhibiting TRIM21 attenuates ferroptosis. A JAK2 inhibitor Fedratinib downregulated TRIM21 expression and reduced damage both in vivo and in vitro, which is correlated with the upregulation of GPX4.Our study showed that loss of TRIM21 could alleviate ferroptosis induced by I/R, revealed the mechanism of ubiquitination degradation of GPX4 by TRIM21 and suggested TRIM21 is a potential target for the treatment of AKI.","['AKI', 'Ferroptosis', 'GPX4', 'TRIM21', 'Ubiquitination degradation']",2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36958072,Risk factors and prognosis of early neurological deterioration in patients with posterior circulation cerebral infarction.,"The incidence, risk factors, and pathogenesis of early neurological deterioration (END) in posterior circulation stroke are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the risk factors and prognosis of END in patients with acute posterior circulation cerebral infarction.Acute posterior circulation ischemic stroke patients who had completed neuroimaging within 72 h of onset were selected from a prospective registry study Demographic characteristics, physiological data, medical history, laboratory data, in-hospital evaluation, neurological severity and TOAST classification, treatment, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of patients were assessed. Early neurological deterioration was defined as an increase of 2 points in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score between the baseline and 72 h evaluation. Favorable and poor outcomes were defined as mRSs of 02 and≥ 3, respectively, at 3 months. The incidence and risk factors were evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression analysis (step-back method).The analysis included 455 subjects with an acute posterior circulation non-cardiac ischemic stroke, 330 (72.53 %) of them male, with an average age of 63.12 ( ± 10.14) years and with 47 (10.33 %) having END. The results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BATMAN scores ≥ 5 (OR: 0.1, 95 % CI: 0.02-0.53, P < 0.01), large artery atherosclerosis (OR: 11.55, 95 % CI: 4.18-31.93, P < 0.01), vascular stenosis > 50 % (OR: 2.44, 95 % CI: 1.1-5.42, P = 0.029), reperfusion therapy (OR: 4.21, 95 % CI: 1.66-10.64, P < 0.01), and the distribution of pontine lesions (OR: 5.66, 95 % CI: 2.39-13.44, P < 0.01) were significantly associated with END. Patients with END had a lower rate of favorable outcomes at discharge and long-term follow-up (P < 0.001), regardless of whether they received reperfusion therapy.The lesion distribution of the pons, the progression of temporo-occipital lobe lesions, and large arterial atherosclerosis are independent risk factors of END that might predict a poor short- and long-term prognosis.","['Acute ischemic stroke', 'Early neurological deterioration', 'Incidence', 'Prognosis', 'Risk factors']",2022-10-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36952592,The combination of astragaloside IV and Panax notoginseng saponins attenuates cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury in rats through ferroptosis and inflammation inhibition via activating Nrf2.,"This study aimed to observe the effect of the combination of astragaloside IV (AST IV) and Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) on cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) and explore the specific mechanism of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated combination of AST IV and PNS against CIRI based on ferroptosis and inflammatory response.The therapeutic effect and mechanism of AST IV and PNS were evaluated by constructing a Sprague-Dawley rat middle cerebral artery ischaemia-occlusion-reperfusion model. The specific mechanism of the combination of AST IV and PNS against CIRI was revealed through the combined intervention of the Nrf2-specific inhibitor brusatol.After AST IV and PNS treatment, the cerebral infarction area of the rats was reduced; behavioural performance was improved; Fe2+, malondialdehyde, lipid peroxidation, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and myeloperoxidase levels were reduced; and glutathione and glutathione peroxidase 4 levels were increased. In addition, the expression of Nrf2 was significantly increased, the combined treatment was more effective than the single treatment, and the Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol could reverse the effects of the combined intervention of AST IV and PNS.The findings of this study suggest that combining AST IV and PNS attenuates CIRI by activating Nrf2 to inhibit ferroptosis and inflammatory responses.","['\n          Panax notoginseng saponins', 'astragaloside IV', 'cerebral ischaemia–reperfusion injury', 'ferroptosis', 'inflammatory', 'nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2']",2022-10-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model was established by middle cerebral artery embolization. Rats of the EA group was treated with EA stimulation (4 Hz/20 Hz, 0.5 mA,20 min) at ""Baihui"" (GV20) and ""Shenting"" (GV24) once a day for 7 consecutive days; rats of EA+Luz group were given the same EA treatment and intraperitoneally administered melatonin receptor antagonist (luzindole, 30 mg/kg), once a day for 7 consecutive days. The neurological impairment was evaluated by Zea Longa score. The level of serum melatonin content at 12:00 and 24:00 was detected by ELISA. The percentage of cerebral infarction volume was evaluated by MRI of small animals. The apoptosis rate of nerve cells in cerebral cortex of infarct side was detected by TUNEL staining. The activation of microglia cells was detected by immunofluorescence staining. The expression levels of pyroptosis-related proteins NLRP3, Caspase-1 and interleukin (IL) -1β were detected by Western blot.Compared with the sham operation group, the neural function score was significantly increased (P<0.01); the melatonin content was significantly decreased at 24:00 (P<0.01); the percentage of cerebral infarction volume, apoptosis rate of nerve cells in cerebral cortex area of infarction side, the expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1β proteins were significantly increased (P<0.01); and microglia cells were significantly activated in the model group.Compared with the model and EA +Luz groups, the nerve function score was significantly decreased (P<0.05); the percentage of cerebral infarction volume, the nerve cell apoptosis rate, the activation level of microglia cells, the expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1 and IL-1β were significantly decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the EA group. Compared with the model and EA+Luz groups, the melatonin content at 24:00 was significantly increased (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the EA group.EA at GV20 and GV24 can reduce the neurolo-gical injury in cerebral ischemia reperfusion model rats, which may be related to regulating the expression of endogenous melatonin, inhibiting cell scorchification and reducing cerebral ischemia injury.目的：探讨电针通过调节褪黑素-核苷酸结合寡聚化结构域样受体蛋白3炎性小体(NLRP3)轴介导的细胞焦亡减轻脑缺血再灌注大鼠脑缺血损伤的机制。方法：SD大鼠随机分为假手术组12只及手术组36只，手术组大鼠采用大脑中动脉栓塞法制备局灶性脑缺血-再灌注损伤模型。大鼠造模成功后进一步分为模型组、电针组和电针+Luz组，每组12只。电针组和电针+Luz组电针“百会”“神庭”，每次20 min，电针+Luz组腹腔注射褪黑素受体拮抗剂luzindole(30 mg/kg)，以上干预均1次/d，干预7 d。采用Zea Longa法评估各组大鼠神经功能缺损情况，ELISA法检测各组大鼠12:00及24:00血清褪黑素含量，小动物MRI评估各组大鼠脑梗死体积百分比，TUNEL法检测各组大鼠梗死侧大脑皮质区神经细胞凋亡水平，免疫荧光技术检测各组大鼠大脑皮质小胶质细胞活化情况，Western blot法检测各组大鼠大脑皮质细胞焦亡相关蛋白NLRP3、半胱氨酸天冬氨酸酶（Caspase)-1、白细胞介素(IL)-1β表达水平。结果：与假手术组比较，模型组大鼠神经功能评分显著升高(P<0.01)，24:00褪黑素含量显著降低(P<0.01)，脑梗死体积百分比、神经细胞凋亡率显著升高(P<0.01)，小胶质细胞明显活化，细胞焦亡相关蛋白NLRP3、Caspase-1、IL-1β表达显著升高(P<0.01)。与模型组和电针+Luz组比较，电针组神经功能评分显著降低(P<0.05)，24:00褪黑素含量显著升高(P<0.01，P<0.05)，脑梗死体积百分比、神经细胞凋亡率显著降低(P<0.01，P<0.05)，小胶质细胞活化水平降低，细胞焦亡相关蛋白NLRP3、 Caspase-1、IL-1β表达显著降低(P<0.01)。结论：电针“百会”“神庭”可减轻脑缺血再灌注模型大鼠神经功能损伤，其机制可能与调控内源性褪黑素表达、抑制细胞焦亡减轻脑缺血再灌注大鼠脑缺血损伤有关。.","['Cerebral ischemia', 'Electroacupuncture', 'Melatonin', 'NOD-like receptor protein 3', 'Pyroptosis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36951068,Hirsutine ameliorates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through improving mitochondrial function via CaMKII pathway.,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is considered the most common contributor to AMI. Hirsutine has been shown to protect cardiomyocytes against hypoxic injury. The present study investigated whether hirsutine improved AMI induced by I/R injury and the underlying mechanisms. In our study, we used a rat model of myocardial I/R injury. The rats were given hirsutine daily (5, 10, 20 mg/kg) by gavage for 15 days before the myocardial I/R injury. Detectable changes were observed in myocardial infarct size, mitochondrial function, histological damage, and cardiac cell apoptosis. According to our findings, hirsutine pre-treatment reduced the myocardial infarct size, enhanced cardiac function, inhibited cell apoptosis, reduced the tissue lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, as well as enhanced myocardial ATP content and mitochondrial complex activity. In addition, hirsutine balanced mitochondrial dynamics by increasing Mitofusin2 (Mfn2) expression while decreasing dynamin-related protein 1 phosphorylation (p-Drp1), which was partially regulated by ROS and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation (p-CaMKII). Mechanistically, hirsutine inhibited mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis during I/R injury by blocking the AKT/ASK-1/p38 MAPK pathway.

36950900,Exosomes derived from human dental pulp stem cells increase flap survival with ischemia-reperfusion injuries.,"Aim: To investigate the effect of hDPSC-Exos in flap I/R injury, a condition in which tissue damage increases after blood flow is restored to the flap after ischemia. Materials & methods: HUVECs were used to investigate the influences and mechanisms of hDPSC-Exos on cell proliferation and migration. A rat model was established to verify the role of hDPSC-Exos in flap I/R injuries in vivo. Results: hDPSC-Exos promoted the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent way by activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and improved the survival and microvessel density of the flap and suppressed epithelial cell apoptosis. Conclusion: hDPSC-Exos can enhance flap repair after I/R injury. This process may be mediated by the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.Skin flap transplantation is one of the most important methods of repairing refractory wounds and organ reconstruction. I/R injury and insufficiency of neovascularization significantly affect the survival of flaps. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) are a type of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) present in dental pulp tissue that have attracted increasing attention. They can play a repair role in a variety of ischemic injuries and neovascularization. Exosomes are important paracrine mediators between MSCs and target cells, containing a variety of proteins, mRNA and miRNA. Recent studies have shown that some exosomes derived from MSCs can improve I/R injury, promote angiogenesis and inhibit apoptosis. This study confirmed that hDPSC-Exos could promote the proliferation, migration and tubule formation of vein endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway can reduce the above promoting effects, suggesting that these processes may depend on the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In the rat model, hDPSC-Exos can significantly improve the survival rate and microvessel density of flaps, and inhibit epithelial cell apoptosis.","['PI3K/AKT', 'exosomes', 'flap', 'human dental pulp stem cells', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

In addition, the interactions between miR-322, Smad7/Smurf2, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1α), and β-catenin were verified by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Our results displayed that miR-322 was significantly downregulated in OGD/R-treated H9c2 cells, and its overexpression resulted in increased cell viability and reduced the apoptosis. Smurf2 and Smad7 were identified as the direct targets of miR-322. Smad7 knockdown or Smurf2 knockdown increased OGD/R-treated H9c2 cell viability and suppressed the apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-322 mimics abolished the mitigating effect of Smad7 or Smurf2 overexpression on MIRI. In addition, the Smad3/β-catenin pathway was identified as the downstream pathway of Smurf2/Smad7. Moreover, it was found that HIF-1α interacted with the miR-322 promoter, and β-catenin interacted with the HIF-1α promoter to form a loop. HIF-1α-induced upregulated miR-322 activated the Smad3/β-catenin pathway by targeting Smurf2 and Smad7 to improve MIRI; meanwhile, β-catenin/HIF-1α formed a positive feedback loop to continuously improve MIRI.","['HIF-1α', 'Smad7', 'Smurf2', 'miR-322', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'positive feedback loop', 'the Smad3/β-catenin']",2022-09-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36950739,M2 Macrophage-Derived sEV Regulate Pro-Inflammatory CCR2+ Macrophage Subpopulations to Favor Post-AMI Cardiac Repair.,"Tissue-resident cardiac macrophage subsets mediate cardiac tissue inflammation and repair after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-expressing macrophages have phenotypical similarities to M1-polarized macrophages, are pro-inflammatory, and recruit CCR2+ circulating monocytes to infarcted myocardium. Small extracellular vesicles (sEV) from CCR2̶ macrophages, which phenotypically resemble M2-polarized macrophages, promote anti-inflammatory activity and cardiac repair. Here, the authors harvested M2 macrophage-derived sEV (M2EV ) from M2-polarized bone-marrow-derived macrophages for intramyocardial injection and recapitulation of sEV-mediated anti-inflammatory activity in ischemic-reperfusion (I/R) injured hearts. Rats and pigs received sham surgery; I/R without treatment; or I/R with autologous M2EV treatment. M2EV rescued cardiac function and attenuated injury markers, infarct size, and scar size. M2EV inhibited CCR2+ macrophage numbers, reduced monocyte-derived CCR2+ macrophage recruitment to infarct sites, induced M1-to-M2 macrophage switching and promoted neovascularization. Analysis of M2EV microRNA content revealed abundant miR-181b-5p, which regulated macrophage glucose uptake, glycolysis, and mitigated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. Functional blockade of miR-181b-5p is detrimental to beneficial M2EV actions and resulted in failure to inhibit CCR2+ macrophage numbers and infarct size. Taken together, this investigation showed that M2EV rescued myocardial function, improved myocardial repair, and regulated CCR2+ macrophages via miR-181b-5p-dependent mechanisms, indicating an option for cell-free therapy for AMI.","['CC chemokine receptor 2', 'extracellular vesicles', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'macrophage metabolic reprogramming', 'macrophages']",2022-05-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36950485,A Review of Machine Perfusion Strategies in Liver Transplantation.,"The acceptance of liver transplantation as the standard of care for end-stage liver diseases has led to a critical shortage of donor allografts. To expand the donor organ pool, many countries have liberalized the donor criteria including extended criteria donors and donation after circulatory death. These marginal livers are at a higher risk of injury when they are preserved using the standard static cold storage (SCS) preservation techniques. In recent years, research has focused on optimizing organ preservation techniques to protect these marginal livers. Machine perfusion (MP) of the expanded donor liver has witnessed considerable advancements in the last decade. Research has showed MP strategies to confer significant advantages over the SCS techniques, such as longer preservation times, viability assessment and the potential to recondition high risk allografts prior to implantation. In this review article, we address the topic of MP in liver allograft preservation, with emphasis on current trends in clinical application. We discuss the relevant clinical trials related to the techniques of hypothermic MP, normothermic MP, hypothermic oxygenated MP, and controlled oxygenated rewarming. We also discuss the potential applications of ex vivo therapeutics which may be relevant in the future to further optimize the allograft prior to transplantation.","['ALP, Alkaline phosphatase', 'ALT, Alanine transaminase', 'ASO, Antisense oligonucleotides', 'AST, Aspartate transaminase', 'CIT, Cold ischemia times', 'COPE, Consortium for Organ Preservation in Europe', 'COR, Controlled oxygenated rewarming', 'DBD, Donation after brain death', 'DCD, Donation after circulatory death', 'DHOPE, dual hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion', 'EAD, Early allograft dysfunction', 'ECD, Extended criteria donors', 'ETC, Electron transport chain', 'GGT, Gamma glutamyl transferase', 'HCV, Hepatitis C virus', 'HMP, Hypothermic machine perfusion', 'HOPE, Hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion', 'ICU, Intensive care unit', 'IGL, Institute George Lopez-1', 'INR, International normalized ratio', 'IRI, ischemia reperfusion injury', 'LDH, Lactate dehydrogenase', 'MELD, Model for end-stage liver disease', 'MP, Machine perfusion', 'NAS, Non-anastomotic biliary strictures', 'NMP, Normothermic machine perfusion', 'NO, Nitric oxide', 'PNF, Primary nonfunction', 'ROS, Reactive oxygen species', 'RT-PCR, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction', 'SNMP, Sub-normothermic machine perfusion', 'UW, University of Wisconsin', 'WIT, Warm ischemia times', 'hypothermic machine perfusion', 'hypothermic oxygenated machine perfusion', 'machine perfusion', 'normothermic machine perfusion', 'static cold storage']",2022-06-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36949221,miR-671-5p Upregulation Attenuates Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption in the Ischemia Stroke Model Via the NF-кB/MMP-9 Signaling Pathway.,"Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption can induce further hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke (IS). miR-671-5p, a micro-RNA, is abundant in the cortex of mammalian brains. Herein, we investigated the roles and potential mechanisms for the effects of miR-671-5p on BBB permeability in IS. Results showed that miR-671-5p levels were significantly downregulated in the cerebral cortex of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) C57/BL6 mice in vivo. miR-671-5p agomir administration via right intracerebroventricular injection significantly reduced infarct volume, improved neurological deficits, the axon of neurons and nerve fiber, attenuated cell injury and apoptosis, as well as reduced BBB permeability in MCAO/R mice. Treatment with miR-671-5p agomir alleviated tight junction proteins degradation, including claudin, occludin, and ZO-1 in MCAO/R mice, and these effects were reversed following NF-κB overexpression. Bend.3 brain endothelial cells were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment in vivo, and then miR-671-5p agomir was transfected into the cells. This resulted in reduction of cytotoxicity, improved cell viability, trans-endothelial electrical resistance, reduced fluorescein sodium permeability, and inhibited tight junction degradation in Bend.3 OGD/R cells. However, these effects were reversed following NF-κB overexpression. These results demonstrated that upregulation of miR-671-5p in IS models in vivo and in vitro alleviated BBB permeability by targeting NF-κB/MMP-9. In summary, miR-671-5p is a potential therapeutic target for protecting BBB permeability in IS to minimize cerebral hemorrhage transformation.","['Blood–brain barrier', 'Ischemia stroke', 'NF-κB', 'miR-671-5p', 'tight junction']",2022-09-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36948202,Effect of implementing care protocols on acute ischemic stroke outcomes: a systematic review.,"Implementing stroke care protocols has intended to provide better care quality, favor early functional recovery, and achieving long-term results for the rehabilitation of the patient.To analyze the effect of implementing care protocols on the outcomes of acute ischemic stroke.Primary studies published from 2011 to 2020 and which met the following criteria were included: population should be people with acute ischemic stroke; studies should present results on the outcomes of using protocols in the therapeutic approach to acute ischemic stroke. The bibliographic search was carried out in June 2020 in 7 databases. The article selection was conducted by two independent reviewers and the results were narratively synthesized.A total of 11,226 publications were retrieved in the databases, of which 30 were included in the study. After implementing the protocol, 70.8% of the publications found an increase in the rate of performing reperfusion therapy, such as thrombolysis and thrombectomy; 45.5% identified an improvement in the clinical prognosis of the patient; and 25.0% of the studies identified a decrease in the length of hospital stay. Out of 19 studies that addressed the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, 2 (10.5%) identified a decrease. A decrease in mortality was mentioned in 3 (25.0%) articles out of 12 that evaluated this outcome.We have identified the importance of implementing protocols in increasing the performance of reperfusion therapies, and a good functional outcome with improved prognosis after discharge. However, there is still a need to invest in reducing post-thrombolysis complications and mortality. A implementação de protocolos de acidente vascular cerebral (AVC) visa proporcionar uma melhor qualidade da assistência, favorecer a recuperação funcional precoce e alcançar resultados para a reabilitação do paciente. Analisar o efeito da implantação de protocolos nos desfechos do AVC isquêmico agudo. MéTODOS:  Foram incluídos estudos primários publicados entre 2011 e 2020 e que atendiam aos seguintes critérios: população deveria ser constituída de pessoas com AVC isquêmico agudo; apresentar resultados sobre os desfechos do uso de protocolos na abordagem terapêutica ao AVC isquêmico agudo.

36948152,Gut microbe-derived milnacipran enhances tolerance to gut ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"There are significant differences in the susceptibility of populations to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that mice exhibit significant differences in susceptibility to I/R-induced enterogenic sepsis. Notably, the milnacipran (MC) content in the enterogenic-sepsis-tolerant mice is significantly higher. We also reveal that the pre-operative fecal MC content in cardiopulmonary bypass patients, including those with intestinal I/R injury, is associated with susceptibility to post-operative gastrointestinal injury. We reveal that MC attenuates mouse I/R injury in wild-type mice but not in intestinal epithelial aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene conditional knockout mice (AHRflox/flox) or IL-22 gene deletion mice (IL-22-/-). Collectively, our results suggest that gut microbiota affects susceptibility to I/R-induced enterogenic sepsis and that gut microbiota-derived MC plays a pivotal role in tolerance to intestinal I/R in an AHR/ILC3/IL-22 signaling-dependent manner, revealing the pathological mechanism, potential prevention and treatment drugs, and treatment strategies for intestinal I/R.","['IL-22', 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'enterogenic sepsis', 'intestinal flora', 'milnacipran']",2022-09-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36948137,"The protective effects of a novel AT2 receptor agonist, β-Pro7Ang III in ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury.","This study investigated the reno-protective effects of a highly selective AT2R agonist peptide, β-Pro7Ang III in a mouse model of acute kidney injury (AKI).C57BL/6 J mice underwent either sham surgery or unilateral kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) for 40 min. IRI mice were treated with either β-Pro7Ang III or perindopril and at 7 days post-surgery the kidneys analysed for histopathology and the development of fibrosis and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activity. The association of the therapeutic effects of β-Pro7Ang III with macrophage number and phenotype was determined in vivo and in vitro.Decreased kidney tubular injury, interstitial matrix expansion and reduced interstitial immune cell infiltration in IRI mice receiving β-Pro7Ang III treatment was observed at day 7, compared to IRI mice without treatment. This correlated to reduced collagen accumulation and MMP-2 activity in IRI mice following β-Pro7Ang III treatment. FACS analysis showed a reduced number and proportion of CD45+CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages in IRI kidneys in response to β-Pro7Ang III, correlating with a significant increase in M2 macrophage markers and decreased M1 markers at day 3 and 7 post-IR injury, respectively. In vitro analysis of cultured THP-1 cells showed that β-Pro7Ang III attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)- 6 production but increased IL-10 secretion, compared to LPS alone.Administration of β-Pro7Ang III via mini-pump improved kidney structure and reduced interstitial collagen accumulation, in parallel with an alteration of macrophage phenotype and anti-inflammatory cytokine release, therefore mitigating the downstream progression of ischemic AKI.","['AT(2)R agonist', 'Acute kidney injury', 'Fibrosis', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Macrophage phenotype', 'Macrophages', 'Metalloproteinase', 'Renin-angiotensin system']",2023-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36947651,Biao and Ben Acupoints Regulate Mitochondrial Function Through P2X Receptor to Improve Myocardial Ischemia.,"Ischemic heart disease is a common disease in older surgical patients. The current treatments for myocardial ischemia mainly restore blood flow to an extent, but reperfusion inevitably causes reperfusion injury. Single-point acupuncture and moxibustion can strengthen the body's resistance and eliminate pathogenic factors, but medical practitioners haven't considered matching acupoints in treatments for myocardial ischemia.The study intended to examine the effects of electroacupuncture using the Biao and Ben acupoints on the structure and function of myocardial mitochondria, the changes in the expression of related proteins, and the intraoperative circulation of rats with myocardial ischemia and to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical use of the Biao-Ben acupoints.The research team performed an animal study.The study took place in Lanzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital.The animals were 84 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 160-220 g.The research team divided the rats into seven groups, with 12 rats in each group. The study evaluated two types of interventions: (1) zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and (2) electroacupuncture. The team used two versions of each type of intervention, for four groups in total: (1) a low dose of ZnCl2, the low-dose ZnCl2 group; (2) a high dose of ZnCl2, the high-dose ZnCl2 group; (3) electroacupuncture using a single acupoint, the Neiguan point, for the Neiguan group; and (4) electroacupuncture using three acupoints, the Neiguan point and the Biao and Ben points, for the Biao-Ben group. The study included three control groups-the control group, a positive control group; the sham group, a ZnCl2 control group; and the model group, a negative control group. The team collectively called five of the groups the operation group, which included all four intervention groups and the model group, in which the team induced ischemic heart disease.The research team measured: (1) the relative changes in the mitochondrial ultrastructure of the rat cardiomyocytes for each group using a laser confocal, fluorescent indicator assay to detect the concentration of calcium(2+) [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes; (2) the content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in myocardial tissue using ATP-detection technology; (3) mitochondrial activity using the fluorescent probe method; and (4) the protein levels of P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7) and mitochondria-related oxidative stress factors on the myocardial cell membrane using Western blot technology. The team monitored the physiology of the rats in each group.Compared with the model group, the two ZnCl2 groups and the two electroacupuncture groups showed: (1) a significantly improved mitochondrial structure and function of the ischemic cardiomyocytes, (2) a significant increase in the mitochondrial activity, (3) a significant increase in the permeability of the membrane and thus an increase the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm, (4) a significant increase in the content of ATP inside and outside the myocardium, (5) at the same time, a significant reduction in the protein levels of the P2X7 receptors on the myocardial cell membrane and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in mitochondria, and (6) a significant reduction in the protein levels of nitric oxide (NO) and cytochrome C (CytC).The Biao and Ben electroacupuncture can improve the structure and function of mitochondria in the myocardial cells of rats with myocardial ischemia, reduce the expression levels of the P2X7 receptor, NO, and CytC proteins, increase the expression levels of PGC-1α and MnSOD, and improve the intraoperative circulation, thus having a positive effect on myocardial ischemia.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36946841,Ovarian hormones influence immune response to liver ischemia-reperfusion.,"Liver injury occurs after ischemia and reperfusion (IR), as seen in transplant settings. Sex hormones have been implicated in many pathophysiological mechanisms in females and this could lead to liver protection under inflammatory reperfusion conditions where an excessive immune response occurs. Despite such assumptions, this fact needs to be further investigated. To address this, female and male C57BL/6J mice (8-12 weeks old) were studied. Bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) was performed in females to decrease estradiol levels. IR was performed, and after two weeks, all animals underwent a sham control operation or IR with euthanasia at the following time points after reperfusion: 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. IR triggered an inflammatory process in the liver with recruitment of neutrophils into the parenchyma of male mice. The female sham mice were protected against liver IR presenting no alteration of aminotransferase (ALT) levels compared to males. OVX caused loss of protection, increasing hepatic injury as represented by increased ALT levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Female sham mice showed increased Akt phosphorylation and activation, while males showed reduced Akt activation. Estradiol pretreatment recovered ALT levels after IR injury, which was associated with decreased liver injury.",[],2022-10-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36946315,Glucagon and exenatide improve contractile recovery following ischaemia/reperfusion in the isolated perfused rat heart.,"The inotropic effects of glucagon have been recognized for many years, but it has remained unclear whether glucagon signaling is beneficial to cardiac function. We evaluated the effects of glucagon alone and in combination with the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist exenatide in the isolated perfused rat heart. The isolated perfused rat heart was used to investigate the initial inotropic and chronotropic effects of glucagon and exenatide during aerobic perfusion, and recovery of contractile function following ischaemia/reperfusion. Glucagon, but not exenatide, elicited an acute chronotropic and inotropic response during aerobic perfusion of the rat heart. Compared with control, glucagon improved recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) by 33% (p < 0.05) and rate-pressure product (RPP) by 66% (p < 0.001) following ischaemia/reperfusion and amplified the mild recovery enhancement elicited by exenatide in a dose-dependent manner. Glucagon shows inotropic properties in the isolated perfused rat heart and improves contractile recovery following ischaemia/reperfusion, both alone and when co-administered with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Glucagon and exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, combine to stimulate greater recovery of postischaemic contractile function in the Langendorff heart. Glucagon was inotropic and chronotropic, yet this initial effect decreased over time and did not account for the increased contractility observed postischaemia/reperfusion.","['GLP-1 receptor agonist', 'cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion', 'contractile recovery', 'glucagon']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Focal cerebral I/R injury was induced in the latter two groups using a modified monofilament occlusion technique, and the intraoperative changes of real-time cerebral cortex blood flow were monitored using a laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF). The postoperative changes of cerebral pathological morphology and the ultrastructure of the neurons and the BBB were observed with optical and transmission electron microscopy. The neurological deficits of the rats was assessed, and the severities of cerebral infarction, brain edema and BBB disruption were quantified. The contents of Fe2+, GSH, MDA and MPO in the ischemic penumbra were determined with spectrophotometric tests. Serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1βwere analyzed using ELISA, and the expressions of GPX4, MMP-9 and occludin around the lesion were detected with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.The rCBF was sharply reduced in the rats in I/R group and SI group after successful insertion of the monofilament. Compared with those in Sham group, the rats in I/R group showed significantly increased neurological deficit scores, cerebral infarction volume, brain water content and Evans blue permeability (P < 0.01), decreased Fe2+ level, increased MDA level, decreased GSH content and GPX4 expression (P < 0.01), increased MPO content and serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β (P < 0.01), increased MMP-9 expression and lowered occludin expression (P < 0.01). All these changes were significantly ameliorated in rats pretreated with IS prior to I/R injury (P < 0.05 or 0.01).SI preconditioning reduces cerebral I/R injury in rats possibly by improving rCBF, inhibiting ferroptosis and inflammatory response and protecting the BBB.基于大豆异黄酮（SI）对区域脑血流（rCBF）、铁死亡、炎症反应和血脑屏障（BBB）通透性的级联调控作用，探讨SI抗脑缺血/再灌注损伤机制。将120只雄性SD大鼠随机分为假手术组（Sham组）、缺血/再灌注组（I/R组）和大豆异黄酮预处理组（SI组），40只/组。采用改良线栓法合并激光多普勒血流仪（LDF）建立大鼠局灶性脑缺血/再灌注损伤模型。术中各组大鼠通过LDF实时监测脑皮层血流动态变化；术后通过光镜和透射电镜观察脑组织病理形态、神经元和BBB超微结构变化，评估神经缺损程度，量化脑梗死、脑水肿和BBB破坏程度，分光光度法检测缺血半暗带Fe2+、谷胱甘肽（GSH）、丙二醛（MDA）、髓过氧化物酶（MPO）含量，ELISA法测定血清TNF-α和IL-1β活性，Western blot法和IHC法检测病灶周围GPX4、MMP-9和Occludin表达。插线成功后I/R组和SI组大鼠rCBF均呈现骤降趋势，而拔线后I/R组rCBF上升慢于SI组；rCBF存在插线后不稳定和拔线后未复流状况。I/R组神经细胞固缩严重，线粒体变小、膜密度增加、嵴减少，紧密连接松散、基底膜厚薄不均，SI组各结构损伤相较于I/R组呈不同程度减轻。与Sham组相比，I/R组神经缺损评分、脑梗死体积、脑含水量和伊文思蓝渗透量明显增加（P < 0.01），Fe2+和MDA含量增多、GSH含量及GPX4表达降低（P < 0.01），MPO含量和血清TNF-α、IL-1β活性增高（P < 0.01），MMP-9表达增多、Occludin表达减少（P < 0.01）；与I/R组相比，SI组神经缺损评分、脑梗死体积、脑含水量和伊文思蓝渗透量降低（P < 0.05或P < 0.01），Fe2+和MDA含量减少、GSH含量及GPX4表达升高（P < 0.05或P < 0.01），MPO含量和血清TNF-α、IL-1β活性降低（P < 0.05或P < 0.01），MMP-9表达下调、Occludin表达上调（P < 0.05，P < 0.01）。SI预处理可能通过改善脑血流，抑制铁死亡、炎症反应和保护BBB，进而减轻脑缺血/再灌注损伤。","['blood-brain barrier', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'ferroptosis', 'inflammatory response', 'regional cerebral blood flow', 'soybean isoflavones']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The expression levels of MDA, ROS, PCO, 8-OHdG, SOD, GSTα4, CAT and GPx in the brain tissue of the mice were detected using commercial kits, and those of AMPK, P-AMPK, DAF-16, FOXO3 and P-FOXO3 were detected with Western blotting. Compound C (CC), an AMPK inhibitor, was used to verify the role of the AMPK pathway in mediating the therapeutic effect of FB. In another 36 C57BL/6 mice randomized into 4 sham-operated group, MCAO model group, FB (40 mg/kg) treatment group, FB+CC (10 mg/kg) treatment group, TTC staining was used to examine the volume of cerebral infarcts, and the levels of ROS and SOD in the brain were detected; the changes in the protein expressions of AMPK, P-AMPK, DAF-16, FOXO3 and P-FOXO3 in the brain tissue were detected using Western blotting.In mice with cerebral IR injury, treatment with FB significantly reduced the levels of ROS, MDA, PCO and 8-OHdG, increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, GSTα4, CAT and GPx, and enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK and FOXO3 and DAF-16 protein expression in the brain tissue (P < 0.01). Compared with FB treatment alone, the combined treatment with FB and CC significantly reduced phosphorylation of AMPK and FOXO3, lowered expression of DAF-16 and SOD activity, and increased cerebral infarction volume and ROS level in the brain tissue of the mice (P < 0.01).FB inhibits oxidative stress injury caused by cerebral I/R in mice possibly by enhancing AMPK phosphorylation, promoting the downstream DAF-16 protein expression and FOXO3 phosphorylation, increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and reducing ROS level in the brain tissue.研究连翘酯苷B(FB)对脑缺血/再灌注(I/R)引起的氧化应激损伤的保护作用及作用机制。将90只C57BL/6小鼠随机分为5组，假手术组(Sham)，模型组(model)，FB低、中、高剂量组(10、20、40 mg/kg)，采用大脑中动脉阻塞(MCAO)2 h，再灌注24 h，制备脑I/R模型。试剂盒检测小鼠脑组织ROS、MDA、PCO、8-OhdG、SOD、GSTα4、CAT、GPx水平，Western blot检测小鼠脑组织AMPK、P-AMPK、DAF-16、FOXO3、P-FOXO3蛋白表达。在此基础上，采用AMPK抑制剂Compound C(CC)验证FB是否通过AMPK发挥抑制氧化应激损伤作用，将36只C57BL/6小鼠随机分为，Sham组、model组、FB (40 mg/kg)组、FB(40 mg/kg)+CC(10 mg/kg)组。TTC染色检测脑梗死体积，试剂盒检测ROS、SOD水平，Western blot检测小鼠脑组织AMPK、P-AMPK、DAF-16、FOXO3、P-FOXO3蛋白表达。与model组比较，FB可降低小鼠脑组织ROS、MDA、PCO、8-OHdG水平，升高小鼠脑组织中抗氧化酶SOD、GSTα4、CAT、GPx活性，提高AMPK、FOXO3磷酸化及DAF-16蛋白表达水平(P < 0.01)。与FB组比较，FB+CC组AMPK和FOXO3磷酸化水平降低，DAF-1表达减少，脑梗死体积增加，ROS水平升高，SOD水平降低(P < 0.01)。FB能够抑制I/R引起的脑组织氧化应激损伤，作用机制是通过促进AMPK磷酸化、其下游DAF-16蛋白表达及FOXO3磷酸化，促进抗氧化酶的表达，清除过量ROS，从而发挥治疗缺血性脑卒中的作用。","['AMPK/DAF-16/FOXO3 pathway', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'forsythiaside B', 'oxidative stress']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

In a xenograft model using tumorigenic Arh1 -KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), tumorigenicity was decreased in Artc1 -KO and heterozygous recipient mice, with tumor infiltration by CD8 + T cells and macrophages, leading to necroptosis, suggesting that ARTC1 promotes the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, Artc1/Arh1 -double-KO MEFs showed decreased tumorigenesis in nude mice, showing that tumor cells as well as tumor microenvironment require ARTC1. By echocardiography and MRI, Artc1 -KO and heterozygous mice showed male-specific, reduced myocardial contractility. Furthermore, Artc1 -KO male hearts exhibited enhanced susceptibility to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury with increased receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3) protein levels compared to WT mice, suggesting that ARTC1 suppresses necroptosis. Overall survival rate of Artc1 -KO was less than their Artc1 -WT counterparts, primarily due to enhanced immune response and inflammation. Thus, anti-ARTC1 agents may reduce tumorigenesis but may increase multi-organ inflammation and decrease cardiac contractility.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36945462,"A PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, improves cardiac dysfunction in ADP-ribose-acceptor hydrolase 3 ( Arh3 ) deficiency.","Patients with ADP-ribose-acceptor hydrolase 3 ( ARH3 ) deficiency exhibit stress-induced childhood-onset neurodegeneration with ataxia and seizures (CONDSIAS). ARH3 degrades protein-linked poly(ADP- ribose) (PAR) synthesized by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)-1 during oxidative stress, leading to cleavage of the ADP-ribose linked to protein. ARH3 deficiency leads to excess accumulation of PAR, resulting in PAR-dependent cell death or parthanatos. Approximately one-third of patients with homozygous mutant ARH3 die from cardiac arrest, which has been described as neurogenic, suggesting that ARH3 may play an important role in maintaining myocardial function. To address this question, cardiac function was monitored in Arh3 -knockout (KO) and - heterozygous (HT) mice.Arh3 -KO male mice displayed cardiac hypertrophy by histopathology and decreased cardiac contractility assessed by MRI. In addition, both genders of Arh3 -KO and -HT mice showed decreased cardiac contractility by dobutamine stress test assessed by echocardiography. A direct role of ARH3 on myocardial function was seen with a Langendorff-perfused isolated heart model . Arh3 -KO male mouse hearts showed decreased post-ischemic rate pressure products, increased size of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) infarcts, and elevated PAR levels. Consistently, in vivo IR injury showed enhanced infarct size in Arh3 -KO mice in both genders. In addition, Arh3 -HT male mice showed increased size of in vivo IR infarcts. Treatment with an FDA-approved PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, improved cardiac contractility during dobutamine-induced stress and exhibited reduced size of in vivo IR infarcts. To understand better the role of ARH3, CRISPR-Cas9 was used to generate different Arh3 genotypes of myoblasts and myotubes. Incubation with H2O2 decreased viability of Arh3 -KO and -HT myoblasts and myotubes, resulting in PAR-dependent cell death that was reduced by PARP inhibitors or by transfection with the Arh3 gene.ARH3 regulates PAR homeostasis in myocardium to preserve function and protect against oxidative stress; PARP inhibitors reduce the myocardial dysfunction seen with Arh3 mutations.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36944948,Association between serum HMGB1 elevation and early pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective study of pediatric living donor liver transplant recipients with biliary atresia in China.,"High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein is one of the main risk factors for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). However, studies of the relationship between HMGB1 and PARDS are lacking. We evaluated the link between anomalies of intraoperative serum HMGB1 and PARDS in pediatric LDLT recipients with biliary atresia during the first week after transplant.Data for 210 pediatric patients with biliary atresia who underwent LDLT between January 2018 and December 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. The main measure was serum HMGB1 levels 30 min after reperfusion, while the outcome was early PARDS after LDLT. Data including pretransplant conditions, laboratory indexes, variables of intraoperation, clinical complications, and outcomes after LDLT were analyzed for each patient. Univariate analysis of PARDS and multivariate logistic regression analyses of serum HMGB1 levels at 30 min in the neohepatic phase in the presence of PARDS were conducted to examine the potential associations. Subgroup interaction analyses and linear relationships between intraoperative serum HMGB1 levels and PARDS were also performed.Among the participants, 55 had PARDS during 7 days after LDLT, including four in the first HMGB1 tertile (4.3-8.1 pg/mL), 18 in the second tertile (8.2-10.6 pg/mL), and 33 in the third tertile (10.6-18.8 pg/mL). The nonadjusted association between intraoperative HMGB1 levels and PARDS was positive (odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence intervals 1.24-1.61, P < 0.0001). The association remained unchanged after adjustment for age, weight, pretransplant total bilirubin, albumin, graft cold ischemia time, and intraoperative blood loss volume (odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.49, P = 0.0017). After controlling for potential confounders, the association between intraoperative HMGB1 levels and PARDS remained positive, as well as in the subgroup analyses.Serum HMGB1 levels at 30 min after reperfusion were positively associated with early PARDS among pediatric patients with biliary atresia who had undergone LDLT. Identifying such patients early may increase the efficacy of perioperative respiratory management.","['Biliary atresia', 'HMGB1', 'Liver transplantation', 'PARDS']",2022-12-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36944895,Inhibition of γδ T Cells Alleviates Blood-Brain Barrier in Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in Mice.,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the leading cause of death following cardiac arrest (CA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). γδT cells are suggested to aggravate blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury in various pathological processes. We herein investigate the effects of γδT cells inhibitor (UC7-13D5) against I/R injury post-CA/CPR. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to CA through injection of KCL (70 μL of 0.5 mol/L) and cessation of mechanical ventilation followed by CPR. Flow cytometry was performed to measure the proportion of CD3-positive cells after intraperitoneal injection of 200 μg UC7-13D5 at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-resuscitation into mice. Neurological scores and modified neurological severity scores were assessed to examine neurological functions. Brain edema was estimated via brain water content measurements. Immunohistochemistry of caspase-3 and immunofluorescence staining of claudin-1, ZO-1 and CD31 were performed to detect neuronal apoptosis, BBB integrity and angiogenesis. Microvascular morphology in the cortical area was assessed via H&E staining. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. Western blotting was performed to measure the protein levels of Nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). UC7-13D5 effectively depleted γδT cells. Inhibition of γδT cells improved neurological deficits and reduced brain edema post-CA/CPR. γδT cells depletion attenuated neuronal apoptosis, BBB disruption and oxidative stress and promoted angiogenesis following CA/CPR. Inhibition of γδT cells facilitated the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in CA/CPR-induced mice. Inhibition of γδT cells alleviates neurological deficits and cerebral edema in mice with CA/CPR by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, BBB disruption and oxidative stress, and promoting angiogenesis via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.","['Blood–brain barrier', 'Cardiac arrest', 'Cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Nrf2', 'γδT cells']",2022-09-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36944606,TMA in Kidney Transplantation.,"Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare and devastating complication of kidney transplantation, which often leads to graft failure. Posttransplant TMA (PT-TMA) may occur either de novo or as a recurrence of the disease. De novo TMA can be triggered by immunosuppressant drugs, antibody-mediated rejection, viral infections, and ischemia/reperfusion injury in patients with no evidence of the disease before transplantation. Recurrent TMA may occur in the kidney grafts of patients with a history of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) in the native kidneys. Studies have shown that some patients with aHUS carry genetic abnormalities that affect genes that code for complement regulators (CFH, MCP, CFI) and components (C3 and CFB), whereas in 10% of patients (mostly children), anti-FH autoantibodies have been reported. The incidence of aHUS recurrence is determined by the underlying genetic or acquired complement abnormality. Although treatment of the causative agents is usually the first line of treatment for de novo PT-TMA, this approach might be insufficient. Plasma exchange typically resolves hematologic abnormalities but does not improve kidney function. Targeted complement inhibition is an effective treatment for recurrent TMA and may be effective in de novo PT-TMA as well, but it is necessary to establish which patients can benefit from different therapeutic options and when and how these can be applied.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36943921,Hedgehog-induced ZFYVE21 promotes chronic vascular inflammation by activating NLRP3 inflammasomes in T cells.,"The zinc finger protein ZFYVE21 is involved in immune signaling. Using humanized mouse models, primary human cells, and patient samples, we identified a T cell-autonomous role for ZFYVE21 in promoting chronic vascular inflammation associated with allograft vasculopathy. Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) stimulated endothelial cells to produce Hedgehog (Hh) ligands, which in turn induced the production of ZFYVE21 in a population of T memory cells with high amounts of the Hh receptor PTCH1 (PTCHhi cells, CD3+CD4+CD45RO+PTCH1hiPD-1hi), vigorous recruitment to injured endothelia, and increased effector responses in vivo. After priming by interferon-γ (IFN-γ), Hh-induced ZFYVE21 activated NLRP3 inflammasome activity in T cells, which potentiated IFN-γ responses. Hh-induced NLRP3 inflammasomes and T cell-specific ZFYVE21 augmented the vascular sequelae of chronic inflammation in mice engrafted with human endothelial cells or coronary arteries that had been subjected to IRI before engraftment. Moreover, the population of PTCHhi T cells producing high amounts of ZFYVE21 was expanded in patients with renal transplant-associated IRI, and sera from these patients expanded this population in control T cells in a manner that depended on Hh signaling. We conclude that Hh-induced ZFYVE21 activates NLRP3 inflammasomes in T cells, thereby promoting chronic inflammation.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36943014,Evaluation of Vascular Repair by Tissue-Engineered Human Acellular Vessels or ePTFE Grafts in a Porcine Model of Limb Ischemia and Reperfusion.,"This study evaluated performance of a tissue-engineered Human Acellular Vessel (HAV) in a porcine model of acute vascular injury and ischemia. The HAV is an engineered blood vessel comprised of human vascular extracellular matrix proteins. Limb reperfusion and vascular outcomes of the HAV were compared to those from synthetic expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts.Thirty-six pigs were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, receiving either the HAV or a PTFE graft following a hind limb ischemia period of either 0- or 6-hours. All grafts were 3 cm-long interposition 6 mm diameter grafts implanted within the right iliac artery. Animals were not immunosuppressed and followed for up to 28 days after surgery. Assessments performed pre- and post-operatively included evaluation of graft patency, hind limb function, and biochemical markers of tissue ischemia or reperfusion injury. Histological analysis was performed on explants to assess host cell responses.Post-operative gait assessment and biochemical analysis confirmed that ischemia and reperfusion injury were caused by 6-hour ischemia, regardless of vascular graft type. Hind limb function and tissue damage biomarkers improved in all groups post-operatively. Final patency rates at post-operative day (POD) 28 were higher for HAV than for ePTFE graft in both the 0-hour (HAV: 85.7%; ePTFE: 66.7%) and 6-hour (HAV: 100%; ePTFE: 75%) ischemia groups but these differences were not statistically significant. Histological analyses identified some intimal hyperplasia and host reactivity to the xenogeneic HAV and also to the synthetic ePTFE graft. Positive host integration and vascular cell infiltration was identified in HAV but not ePTFE explants.Based on the functional performance and the histologic profile of explanted HAVs, this study supports further investigation to evaluate long-term performance of the HAV when used to repair traumatic vascular injuries.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36942507,"Single- and Multiple-dose Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of ASP1128, a Novel Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor δ Modulator, in Healthy Participants.","Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) plays a central role in modulating mitochondrial function in ischemia-reperfusion injury. ASP1128, a potent and selective modulator of PPARδ, is currently under investigation for treating acute kidney injury. This randomized, first-in-human study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ASP1128 administered intravenously in healthy participants. Forty-nine participants received a single dose of ASP1128 0.3-10 mg (n = 37) or placebo (n = 12) and 53 received daily (7 days) doses of ASP1128 3-100 mg (n = 39) or placebo (n = 14), including a cohort aged ≥65 years (ASP1128 100 mg, n = 3; placebo, n = 2). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 37.8%, 59.0%, and 33.3%-35.7% of participants in the single ASP1128, multiple ASP1128, and placebo groups, respectively. All were mild in severity, and the frequency of adverse events did not appear to be dose-related. One participant (multiple ASP1128 3 mg group) withdrew with an infusion site erythema, possibly related to study drug. Exposure was roughly dose-proportional, and elimination was generally consistent across doses (mean t½ 14.6-17.4 hours in the 10, 30, and 100 mg groups on day 7). There was little accumulation in plasma following multiple dosing; steady state was reached after ∼4 days. ASP1128 treatment led to rapid and dose-related upregulation of six fatty acid oxidation-related PPARδ target genes at ≥10 mg, which lasted >24 hours postdose. In conclusion, single and multiple intravenous doses of ASP1128 were generally well tolerated, with dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and target gene engagement in healthy participants.","['acute kidney injury', 'first-in-human', 'mitochondria', 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ', 'phase 1']",2022-12-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36942070,CREB1 and PPAR-α/γ Pathways in Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion: Route for Curcumin to Hepatoprotection.,"Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury is a major problem that can exacerbate complications, particularly in liver transplantations.This study aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury and hepatoprotection by curcumin.Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups as Control, Sham, I/R, and Cur+I/R. Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion was induced in I/R and Cur+I/R animals, the latter of which was also given 50 mg/kg/day of curcumin for 14 days. Liver aminotransferases and the transcription regulators of inflammation (RelA, IκB, PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, CREB1) were examined along with the histological examination.Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion was found to disrupt hepatic microstructure and downregulate PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, and CREB1 transcripts. Curcumin supplementation in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion recovered the structural organization and promoted the hepatocyte regeneration while increasing expressions of PPARs and CREB1. RelA and IκB were found unaltered, possibly due to the crosstalk between targeted transcripts by ischemia/reperfusion and curcumin.In sum, PPAR-α/γ and CREB1 were involved in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion and, moreover, were detected to be stimulated by curcumin. PPAR and CREB pathways were found to provide a route to hepatoprotection for curcumin supplementation as evidenced by the microstructural improvement.","['CREB', 'Curcumin', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia/Reperfusion', 'Liver', 'PPAR']",2022-11-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36941559,Hypothermia-induced accelerated idioventricular rhythm after cardiac surgery; a case report.,"Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) is a slow ventricular arrhythmia, commonly due to myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease. It is a transitory rhythm that rarely causes hemodynamic instability or necessitates any specific therapy. Besides, the common predisposing factors for ventricular arrhythmias after open-heart surgery are hemodynamic instability, electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia, hypovolemia, myocardial ischemia and infarction, acute graft closure, reperfusion injury, and administration of inotropes and antiarrhythmic drugs. Here we report a case of AIVR after cardiac surgery, mostly due to hypothermia that to our knowledge, it is the first report.We describe a 76-year-old man presenting with typical chest pain. Following routine investigations, the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Postoperatively, he was transferred to the intensive care unit with good hemodynamic status. However, about 3 h later, he developed rhythm disturbances, leading to hemodynamic instability without response to volume replacement or inotropic support. His rhythm was AIVR, although, at first glance, it resembled the left bundle branch block. Given his unstable hemodynamic status, he was emergently transferred to the operating room. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was resumed for hemodynamic support. After the patient was rewarmed to about 35 ºC, AIVR returned to normal. He was weaned from CPB successfully and with an uneventful hospital course.Hypothermia is a potential cause of rhythm disturbance. Preventing the causes of arrhythmias, including hypothermia, is the best strategy.","['Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm', 'Cardiac Surgery', 'Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts', 'Hypothermia']",2022-07-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Thus, this study was conducted to extend their half-life by encapsulation into nano‑niosomes and examine their cardioprotective effects in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). In order to synthesize nano‑niosomes, surface active agent film hydration method was used. Characterization of nano‑niosomes was performed using the atomic force microscopy (AFM). In order to establish MI/R model in rats, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated for 30 min. A single dose (150µL) of drug formulations was injected into the infarcted region. The cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, apoptotic factors, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were evaluated using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Particle size of only nano-niosomes was in the range of 60-90 nm, while a shift to 70-110 nm was seen after DNAzyme encapsulation. MI rats treated with DNAzyme‑loaded nano‑niosomes could markedly reduce Bax, caspase3, TNF-α, IL-1β, and NF-κB as well as increase Bcl-2 compared to only MI/R group. Collectively, our finding show that nano‑niosomes can be considered excellent drug delivery platforms to extend half-life and stability of DNAzyme, when it is used to reduce myocardial I/R injury.","['Apoptosis', 'DNAzyme', 'Inflammation', 'Myocardial infarction', 'NF-κB', 'Nano‑niosomes']",2023-03-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36940849,Mechanistic Insight and Clinical Implications of Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Post Liver Transplantation.,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury is an inevitable process during liver transplantation and can lead to a high incidence of early allograft dysfunction and graft failure. The mechanism of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury has been elucidated as the sequelae of microcirculation dysfunction, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and cell death. In addition, the essential role of innate and adaptive immune response in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury and its deleterious outcomes have been discovered. Furthermore, mechanistic studies of living donor liver transplantation have elucidated distinct features of mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction in steatotic and small-for-size graft injury. The mechanistic findings of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury have laid the foundation for exploring new biomarkers; however, they are yet to be validated in large cohorts. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanistic analysis of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury has promoted the development of potential therapeutics in preclinical and clinical trials. This review summarizes the most up to date evidence for liver ischemia/reperfusion injury and puts forward the importance of the spatiotemporal microenvironment that results from microcirculation dysfunction, hypoxia, metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, innate immunologic response, adaptive immunity, and cell death signaling.","['Biomarker', 'Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Therapy']",2022-12-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

AKI is associated with distant organ dysfunction where systemic inflammation and oxidative stress play major roles. In this study, the effect of Prazosin, an α1-Adrenergic receptor antagonist, was investigated on the liver injury induced by kidney ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) in rats. Male adult Wistar rats (n=21) were divided into three groups: sham, kidney I/R, and kidney I/R pre-treated with Prazosin (1 mg/kg). Kidney I/R was induced by vascular clamping of the left kidney for 45 min to reduce the blood flow. Oxidative and antioxidant factors along with apoptotic (Bax, Bcl-2, caspase3), and inflammatory (NF-κβ, IL-1β, and IL-6) factors were measured in the liver at protein levels. Prazosin could reserve liver function (p<0.01) and increase glutathione level (p<0.05) after kidney I/R significantly. Malonil dialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation marker, was diminished more significantly in Prazosin-treated rats compared to the kidney I/R group (p<0.001). Inflammatory and apoptotic factors were diminished by Prazosin pre-treatment in the liver tissue (p<0.05).

36939958,Postconditioning with Lactate-Enriched Blood for Reducing Lethal Reperfusion Injury in Humans.,"Ischemic myocardium cannot survive without reperfusion. However, reperfusion of the ischemic myocardium paradoxically induces myocyte death; this phenomenon is termed lethal reperfusion injury. To date, no effective approach has been demonstrated for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in clinical settings. Recently, we demonstrated a novel approach for cardioprotection, termed postconditioning with lactate-enriched blood (PCLeB). PCLeB comprises intermittent reperfusion and timely coronary injections of lactated Ringer's solution, which is implemented at the beginning of reperfusion. This approach is aimed at reducing lethal reperfusion injury via prolonging intracellular acidosis during the early period of reperfusion, compared with the original postconditioning protocol. Patients with STEMI treated using PCLeB have reported positive outcomes. This article represents an effort, with a perspective different from current insights, toward preventing lethal reperfusion injury, in light of the historical background of reperfusion injury research. PCLeB is considered the new approach for cardioprotection.","['Cardioprotection', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction']",2022-12-31,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36939886,The forkhead box O3 (FOXO3): a key player in the regulation of ischemia and reperfusion injury.,"Forkhead box O3 is a protein encoded by the FOXO3 gene expressed throughout the body. FOXO3 could play a crucial role in longevity and many other pathologies, such as Alzheimer's disease, glioblastoma, and stroke. This study is a comprehensive review of the expression of FOXO3 under ischemia and reperfusion (IR) and the molecular mechanisms of its regulation and function. We found that the expression level of FOXO3 under ischemia and IR is tissue-specific. Specifically, the expression level of FOXO3 is increased in the lung and intestinal epithelial cells after IR. However, FOXO3 is downregulated in the kidney after IR and in the skeletal muscles following ischemia. Interestingly, both increased and decreased FOXO3 expression have been reported in the brain, liver, and heart following IR. Nevertheless, these contribute to stimulating ischemia and reperfusion injury via the induction of inflammatory response, apoptosis, autophagy, mitophagy, pyroptosis, and oxidative damage. These results suggest that FOXO3 could play protective effects in some organs and detrimental effects in others against IR injury. Most importantly, these findings indicate that controlling FOXO3 expression, genetically or pharmacologically, could contribute to preventing or treating ischemia and reperfusion damage.","['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Blood flow', 'Inflammation', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-09-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36939736,Quantification of Penumbral Volume in Association With Time From Stroke Onset in Acute Ischemic Stroke With Large Vessel Occlusion.,"The benefit of reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke decreases over time. This decreasing benefit is presumably due to the disappearance of salvageable ischemic brain tissue (ie, the penumbra).To study the association between stroke onset-to-imaging time and penumbral volume in patients with acute ischemic stroke with a large vessel occlusion.A retrospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2022. To limit selection bias, patients were selected from (1) the prospective registries of 2 comprehensive centers with systematic use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with perfusion, including both thrombectomy-treated and untreated patients, and (2) 1 prospective thrombectomy study in which MRI with perfusion was acquired per protocol but treatment decisions were made with clinicians blinded to the results. Consecutive patients with acute stroke with intracranial internal carotid artery or first segment of middle cerebral artery occlusion and adequate quality MRI, including perfusion, performed within 24 hours from known symptoms onset were included in the analysis.Time from stroke symptom onset to baseline MRI.Penumbral volume, measured using automated software, was defined as the volume of tissue with critical hypoperfusion (time to maximum >6 seconds) minus the volume of the ischemic core. Substantial penumbra was defined as greater than or equal to 15 mL and a mismatch ratio (time to maximum >6-second volume/core volume) greater than or equal to 1.8.Of 940 patients screened, 516 were excluded (no MRI, n = 19; no perfusion imaging, n = 59; technically inadequate perfusion imaging, n = 75; second segment of the middle cerebral artery occlusion, n = 156; unwitnessed stroke onset, n = 207). Of 424 included patients, 226 (53.3%) were men, and mean (SD) age was 68.9 (15.1) years. Median onset-to-imaging time was 3.8 (IQR, 2.4-5.5) hours. Only 16 patients were admitted beyond 10 hours from symptom onset. Median core volume was 24 (IQR, 8-76) mL and median penumbral volume was 58 (IQR, 29-91) mL. An increment in onset-to-imaging time by 1 hour resulted in a decrease of 3.1 mL of penumbral volume (β coefficient = -3.1; 95% CI, -4.6 to -1.5; P < .001) and an increase of 3.0 mL of core volume (β coefficient = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-4.7; P < .001) after adjustment for confounders. The presence of a substantial penumbra ranged from approximately 80% in patients imaged at 1 hour to 70% at 5 hours, 60% at 10 hours, and 40% at 15 hours.Time is associated with increasing core and decreasing penumbral volumes. Despite this, a substantial percentage of patients have notable penumbra in extended time windows; the findings of this study suggest that a large proportion of patients with large vessel occlusion may benefit from therapeutic interventions.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36937464,Semaglutide in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice.,"Ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R) is a serious condition leading to organ failure, characterized by poor blood supply followed by rapid resuscitation of blood flow and reoxygenation. Renal failure caused by renal ischemia has high mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to explore the potential role of Semaglutide as a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for acute renal failure. Additionally, we aimed to assess the possible protective effect of Semaglutide on kidney I/R injury in mice through modulation of the inflammatory and oxidative pathways via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/adenosine triphosphate (PI3K/AKT) activation. We employed twenty-eight albino mice to induce the I/R injury model by clamping the renal artery for 30 min followed by a period of reperfusion for 2 hours. The control group was exposed to I/R injury, while the Semaglutide-treated group was pretreated with the drug 12 hours before induction of ischemia at a dose of 100 nmol/L/kg via the intraperitoneal route (i.p). In addition, the DMSO-treated group was subjected to similar conditions to the Semaglutide-treated group. At the end of the experiments, kidneys and blood samples were collected for investigation. Semaglutide could act as a protective agent against acute kidney injury by reducing inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and its cognate receptor, TNF-α R, interleukine-6 (IL-6). Furthermore, Semaglutide reduced F8 isoprostane levels, increased PI3K and AKT levels in renal tissues, and mitigated renal damage. Semaglutide had renoprotective effects via modulation of the inflammatory response and oxidative pathway by targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.","['PI3K/AKT pathway', 'concomitant reoxygenation', 'ischemia', 'perfusion reoxygenation', 'reperfusion']",2022-10-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Nanomedicine uses the latest technological advancement, which has emerged from interdisciplinary efforts involving biomedical sciences, physics and engineering to protect and improve human health. Antioxidant nanoparticles are potential therapeutic agents. The present study investigated the effects of cerium oxide (Co) administration and sevoflurane anesthesia on liver tissue with IR injury. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into control, Co, IR, IR-Sevoflurane (IRS), Co + IR and Co + IRS groups. In the IR, IRS and Co + IRS groups, hepatic IR was induced. Intraperitoneal Co was administered to the Co groups 30 min before ischemia. Sevoflurane was administered to the IRS and Co + IRS groups during IR injury. Liver tissue samples were examined under the light microscope by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) levels as well as catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity were evaluated in liver tissue samples. The IR group had considerably more hydropic degeneration, sinusoidal dilatation and parenchymal neutrophil infiltration than the Co, IRS, Co + IR and Co + IRS groups. CAT and GST enzyme activity were significantly higher in Co and Co + IR groups compared with the IR group. TBARS levels were significantly lower in Co, IRS, Co + IR and Co + IRS groups compared whit those in the IR group. Intraperitoneal injection of Co with sevoflurane decreased oxidative stress and damage to the liver.","['biochemical analysis', 'cerium oxide', 'histopathological analysis', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'liver', 'sevoflurane']",2022-05-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36936290,Role of Autophagy Mediated by AMPK/DDiT4/mTOR Axis in HT22 Cells Under Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation/Reoxygenation.,"Background: cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an important complication of ischemic stroke, and autophagy is one of the mechanisms of it. In this study, we aimed to determine the role and mechanism of autophagy in cerebral I/R injury. Methods: the oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) method was used to model cerebral I/R injury in HT22 cells. CCK-8 and LDH were conducted to detect viability and damage of the cells, respectively. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry and Tunel staining. Autophagic vesicles of HT22 cells were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Western blotting analysis was used to examine the protein expression involving AMPK/DDiT4/mTOR axis and autophagy-related proteins. 3-Methyladenine and rapamycin were, respectively, used to inhibit and activate autophagy, compound C and AICAR acted as AMPK inhibitor and activator, respectively, and were used to control the starting link of AMPK/DDiT4/mTOR axis. Results: autophagy was activated in HT22 cells after OGD/R was characterized by an increased number of autophagic vesicles, the expression of Beclin1 and LC3II/LC3I, and a decrease in the expression of P62. Rapamycin could increase the viability, reduce LDH leakage rate, and alleviate cell apoptosis in OGD/R cells by activating autophagy. 3-Methyladenine played an opposite role to rapamycin in OGD/R cells. The expression of DDiT4 and the ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK were increased after OGD/R in HT22 cells. While the ratio of p-mTOR/mTOR was reduced by OGD/R, AICAR effectively increased the number of autophagic vesicles, improved viability, reduced LDH leakage rate, and alleviated apoptosis in HT22 cells which suffered OGD/R. However, the effects of compound C in OGD/R HT22 cells were opposite to that of AICAR. Conclusions: autophagy is activated after OGD/R; autophagy activator rapamycin significantly enhanced the protective effect of autophagy on cells of OGD/R. AMPK/DDiT4/mTOR axis is an important pathway to activate autophagy, and AMPK/DDiT4/mTOR-mediated autophagy significantly alleviates cell damage caused by OGD/R.",[],2022-11-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36935924,Relationship between ferroptosis and mitophagy in cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury: a mini-review.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), with high morbidity and mortality, seriously affect people's life and social development. Clinically, reperfusion therapy is typically used to treat ischemic cardiomyopathy, such as severe coronary heart disease and acute myocardial infarction. However, reperfusion therapy can lead to myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI), which can affect the prognosis of patients. Studying the mechanisms of MIRI can help us improve the treatment of MIRI. The pathological process of MIRI involves many mechanisms such as ferroptosis and mitophagy. Ferroptosis can exacerbate MIRI, and regulation of mitophagy can alleviate MIRI. Both ferroptosis and mitophagy are closely related to ROS, but there is no clear understanding of the relationship between ferroptosis and mitophagy. In this review, we analyzed the relationship between ferroptosis and mitophagy according to the role of mTOR, NLPR3 and HIF. In addition, simultaneous regulation of mitophagy and ferroptosis may be superior to single therapy for MIRI. We summarized potential drugs that can regulate mitophagy and/or ferroptosis, hoping to provide reference for the development of drugs and methods for MIRI treatment.","['Ferroptosis', 'Mechanism', 'Mitophagy', 'Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Relationship']",2022-08-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

GSPB2 group: GSPB2 was injected intraperitoneally 45 min before right nephrectomy. IRI group: right kidney was resected and the left renal arteriovenous vessel was blocked for 45 min. GSPB2 + IRI group: GSPB2 was intraperitoneally injected 45 min before IRI established. GSPB2 + BRU + IRI group: GSPB2 and brusatol (BRU) were injected intraperitoneally 45 min before IRI established. Creatinine and urea nitrogen of mice were detected, and the kidney morphology and pathological changes of each group were detected by HE staining, PAS staining and transmission electron microscopy. Expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, GRP78, CHOP, and cleaved-caspase3 were detected by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting.Morphology and mitochondrial damages of kidney in GSPB2 + IRI group were significantly alleviated than those in IRI group. Expression levels of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly higher in GSPB2 + IRI group than those in IRI group. Expression levels of GRP78, CHOP and cleaved-caspase3 were significantly lower in GSPB2 + IRI group than those in IRI group. However, compared to GSPB2 + IRI group, protective effects of GSPB2 pretreatment were weakened in GSPB2 + BRU + IRI group.GSPB2 pretreatment could alleviate oxidative stress damage and reduce apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells, which might be related to activating the antioxidant system, up-regulating the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1, inhibiting the expressions of GRP78, CHOP and cleaved-caspase3. However, the protective effect could be reversed by brusatol.","['Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'Grape seed proanthocyanidin B2', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Mitochondrial damage', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-01-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

(CXEO) are considered to be important parts of the pharmacological action of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. CXEO have a wide range of applications in various fields. Despite the interesting properties of CXEO, the volatility and low solubility have limited the application. Liposomes are vesicles composed of concentric bilayer lipids arranged around the water environment. Therefore, this study aimed to prepare stable CXEO liposomes (CXEO-LP) to improve the properties. Then, CXEO-LP were prepared by thin film dispersion method and optimized. The results showed that CXEO-LP were well dispersed. Subsequently, in vitro release and antioxidant properties of CXEO-LP were researched. CXEO-LP had slow release effect and oxidation resistance, indicating CXEO-LP may be a potential drug for treating cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). The nasal mucosa toxicity test and acute toxicity test showed that CXEO-LP had no obvious toxicity to nasal cavity, heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney tissues. Pharmacodynamic studies found that CXEO-LP significantly improved neurological deficits and brain pathology in a mouse model of CIRI compared to CXEO after intranasal administration. In general, this study showed that CXEO-LP were easy to prepare and continuously released, and had an important development prospect in the treatment of CIRI.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Characterization', 'Essential oil', 'Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort', 'Liposome', 'Preparation', 'Safety evaluation']",2023-01-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Herein, we prepared hybrid membrane nanovesicles (YC-1@[RBC-PL] NVs) composed of red blood cell (RBC) membrane and platelet (PL) membrane encapsulating hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) inhibitor YC-1 for contributing to the protection of the neurovascular unit (NVU) in ischemic stroke. YC-1@[RBC-PL] NVs targeted the ischemic brain by the thrombus targeting properties of PL membrane and relieved the hypoxia inside ischemic brain in the presence of YC-1 and catalase in YC-1@[RBC-PL] NVs.

36934412,MicroRNA-17-3p protects against excessive posthypoxic autophagy in H9C2 cardiomyocytes via PTEN-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.,"The activity of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can be inhibited by miR-17-3p, which results in attenuating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), however, the mechanism behind this phenomenon is still elusive. Suppression of PTEN leads to augmented protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling strength and constrained autophagy activation, which might be the one mechanism for the ameliorated myocardial IRI. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that miR-17-3p attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-mediated damage in cardiomyocytes by downregulating excessive autophagy via the PTEN-Akt-mTOR axis. The expression of miR-17-3p was remarkably increased after H/R treatment (6-h hypoxia followed by 6-h reoxygenation; H6/R6), which was concomitant with the increase of the release of lactic acid dehydrogenase (cell injury marker) and the enhancement LC3II/I ratio (autophagy markers) in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Ectoexpression of miR-17-3p agomir led to remarkable augmentation of miR-17-3p expression and evidently attenuated H/R-mediated cell damage and excessive autophagy. Furthermore, an increase in miR-17-3p expression elicited constrained phosphorylation of PTEN (Ser380 ) while enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (Thr308 , Ser473 ) and mTOR (Ser536 ) after H/R stimulation. In addition, pretreatment with LY-294002 (an Akt selective inhibitor) and rapamycin (an mTOR selective inhibitor) significantly abrogated the protective function of miR-17-3p on H/R-mediated cell damage and autophagy in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these observations indicated that the enhancement of the PTEN/Akt/mTOR axis and the consequent suppression of autophagy overactivation might represent an underlying mechanism by which miR-17-3p attenuated H/R-mediated damage in H9C2 cells.","['autophagy', 'cardiomyocytes', 'hypoxia/reoxygenation', 'microRNA', 'rat']",2022-07-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36934206,Liraglutide Attenuates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Through the Inhibition of Necroptosis by Activating GLP-1R/PI3K/Akt Pathway.,"Necroptosis is a crucial programmed cell death that is tightly associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI). Liraglutide is an effective option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has recently been reported to exert cardioprotective effects on MI/RI. Researchers do not know whether the cardioprotective effect of liraglutide is involved in regulating necroptosis. This study aimed to explore the effect of liraglutide on MI/RI-induced necroptosis and its potential mechanisms. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) was performed on H9c2 cells in vitro to simulate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and an MI/RI rat model was established in vivo by ligating the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery. H/R or I/R damage was assessed by performing biochemical assay, Hoechst 33342/PI staining, H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) staining, and Annexin-V/PI staining. Our data revealed that liraglutide resulted in markedly increased cell viability and reduced cardiac enzyme release by protecting cardiomyocytes from a necrosis-like phenotype after H/R. The myocardial infarct size and cardiac enzyme release were reduced in the heart tissues from the liraglutide-treated group. The levels of necroptosis-associated proteins (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), p-RIPK3, and phosphorylated-mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (p-MLKL)) were also reduced by the liraglutide treatment. Mechanistically, we revealed that liraglutide exerted cardioprotective effects through a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent pathway. Both the GLP-1R inhibitor exendin (9-39) and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the protective effects of liraglutide in vitro. We found that liraglutide may attenuate MI/RI by inhibiting necroptosis, in part by enhancing the activity of the GLP-1R/PI3K/Akt pathway.","['Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R)', 'Liraglutide', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI)', 'Necroptosis', 'PI3K/Akt pathway']",2022-07-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36934127,Elamipretide mitigates ischemia-reperfusion injury in a swine model of hemorrhagic shock.,"ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after hemorrhage is potentiated by aortic occlusion or resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA). Given the central role of mitochondrial injury in shock, we hypothesized that Elamipretide, a peptide that protects mitochondria, would mitigate IRI after hemorrhagic shock and REBOA. Twelve pigs were subjected to hemorrhagic shock and 45 min of REBOA. After 25 min of REBOA, animals received either saline or Elamipretide. Animals were transfused with autologous blood during balloon deflation, and pigs were resuscitated with isotonic crystalloids and norepinephrine for 4.25 h. Elamipretide-treated animals required less crystalloids than the controls (62.5 [50-90] and 25 [5-30] mL/kg, respectively), but similar amounts of norepinephrine (24.7 [8.6-39.3] and 9.7 [2.1-12.5] mcg/kg, respectively). Treatment animals had a significant reduction in serum creatinine (control: 2.7 [2.6-2.8]; Elamipretide: 2.4 [2.4-2.5] mg/dL; p = 0.04), troponin (control: 3.20 [2.14-5.47] ng/mL, Elamipretide: 0.22 [0.1-1.91] ng/mL; p = 0.03), and interleukin-6 concentrations at the end of the study. There were no differences in final plasma lactate concentration. Elamipretide reduced fluid requirements and protected the kidney and heart after profound IRI. Further understanding the subcellular consequences of REBOA and mitochondrial rescue will open new therapeutic avenues for patients suffering from IRI after hemorrhage.",[],2022-12-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36934048,Regulatory effect of orexin system on various diseases through mTOR signaling pathway.,"Orexin (OX)A and OXB are a pair of neuropeptides secreted by orexin-producing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. The orexin system can regulate many physiological processes through these two receptor pathways, such as feeding behavior, sleep/wake state, energy homeostasis, reward, and the coordination of emotion. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) can coordinate upstream signals with downstream effectors, thereby regulating fundamental cellular processes and also plays an essential role in the signaling network downstream of the orexin system. In turn, the orexin system can activate mTOR. Here, we review the association of the orexin system with the mTOR signaling pathway mainly by discussing that drugs in various diseases exert their effects on the orexin system, indirectly affecting the mTOR signaling pathway.","['cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'orexin', 'orexinergic receptor']",2023-01-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36933866,Umbelliferone protects against cerebral ischemic injury through selective autophagy of mitochondria.,"Effective therapeutic treatments for ischemic stroke are limited. Previous studies suggest selective activation of mitophagy alleviates cerebral ischemic injury while excessive autophagy is detrimental. However, few compounds are available to selectively activate mitophagy without affecting autophagy flux. Here, we found that acute administration of Umbelliferone (UMB) upon reperfusion exerted neuroprotective effects against ischemic injury in mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and suppressed oxygen-glucose deprivation reperfusion (OGD-R)-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Interestingly, UMB promoted the translocation of mitophagy adaptor SQSTM1 to mitochondria and further reduced the mitochondrial content as well as the expression of SQSTM1 in SHSY5Y cells after OGD-R. Importantly, both the mitochondrial loss and reduction of SQSTM1 expression after UMB incubation can be reversed by autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and wortmannin, proving the mitophagy activation by UMB. Nevertheless, UMB failed to further affect neither LC3 lipidation nor the number of autophagosomes after cerebral ischemia in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, UMB facilitated OGD-R-induced mitophagy in a Parkin-dependent manner. Inhibition of autophagy/mitophagy either pharmaceutically or genetically abolished the neuroprotective effects of UMB. Taken all, these results suggest that UMB protects against cerebral ischemic injury, both in vivo and in vitro, via promoting mitophagy without increasing the autophagic flux. UMB might serve as a potential leading compound for selectively activating mitophagy and the treatment of ischemic stroke.","['Autophagy', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Mitophagy', 'Parkin', 'Umbelliferone']",2023-01-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36933376,Chrysin protects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in hippocampus via restraining oxidative stress and transition elements.,"Chrysin is a natural flavonoid compound that has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Cerebral ischemia reperfusion (CIR) is closely connected with increased oxidative stress in the hippocampal CA1 region and homeostasis disorder of transition elements such as iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). This exploration was conducted to elucidate the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of chrysin based on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats. Experimentally, sham group, model group, chrysin (50.0 mg/kg) group, Ginaton (21.6 mg/kg) group, Dimethyloxallyl Glycine (DMOG, 20.0 mg/kg) + chrysin group and DMOG group were devised. The rats in each group were performed to behavioral evaluation, histological staining, biochemical kit detection, and molecular biological detection. The results indicated that chrysin restrained oxidative stress and the rise of transition element levels, and regulated transition element transporter levels in tMCAO rats. DMOG activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 subunit alpha (HIF-1α), reversed the antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of chrysin, and increased transition element levels. In a word, our findings emphasize that chrysin plays a critical role in protecting CIR injury via inhibiting HIF-1α against enhancive oxidative stress and raised transition metal levels.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CIR)', 'Chrysin', 'Hippocampus', 'In vivo', 'Oxidative stress', 'Transition element']",2023-01-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36933163,Effect of the Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Diclofenac on Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rat Liver: A Nitric Oxide-Dependent Mechanism.,"Ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable complication of liver surgery and transplantation. The purpose of this study was to examine the beneficial effects of diclofenac on hepatic IRI and the mechanism behind it. Wistar rats' livers were subjected to warm ischemia for 60 min followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Diclofenac was administered intravenously 15 min before ischemia at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg body weight. To determine the mechanism of diclofenac protection, the NOS inhibitor L-Nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was administered intravenously 10 min after diclofenac injection (40 mg/kg). Liver injury was evaluated by aminotransferases (ALT and AST) activities and histopathological analysis. Oxidative stress parameters (SOD, GPX, MPO, GSH, MDA, and PSH) were also determined. Then, eNOS gene transcription and p-eNOS and iNOS protein expressions were evaluated. The transcription factors PPAR-γ and NF-κB in addition to the regulatory protein IκBα were also investigated. Finally, the gene expression levels of inflammatory (COX-2, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18, TNF-α, HMGB-1, and TLR-4) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bax) markers were measured. Diclofenac, at the optimal dose of 40 mg/kg, decreased liver injury and maintained histological integrity. It also reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Its mechanism of action essentially depended on eNOS activation rather than COX-2 inhibition, since pre-treatment with L-NAME abolished all the protective effects of diclofenac. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that diclofenac protects rat liver against warm IRI through the induction of NO-dependent pathway. Diclofenac reduced oxidative balance, attenuated the activation of the subsequent pro-inflammatory response and decreased cellular and tissue damage. Therefore, diclofenac could be a promising molecule for the prevention of liver IRI.","['COX-2', 'Diclofenac', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'PPAR-γ', 'eNOS']",2022-12-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Previous study indicates that sympathetic outflow is increased under emotional stress. We aim to investigate the role of increased sympathetic outflow induced by emotional stress in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, and explore the underlying mechanisms.We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs technique to activate the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a critical emotion-related nucleus. The results revealed that emotional stress stimulated by VMH activation increased sympathetic outflow, enhanced blood pressure, aggravated myocardial I/R injury, and exacerbated infarct size. The RNA-seq and molecular detection demonstrated that toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), and downstream inflammatory markers in cardiomyocytes were significantly upregulated. Emotional stress-induced sympathetic outflow further exacerbated the disorder of the TLR7/MyD88/IRF5 inflammatory signaling pathway. While inhibition of the signaling pathway partially alleviated myocardial I/R injury aggravated by emotional stress-induced sympathetic outflow.Increased sympathetic outflow induced by emotional stress activates TLR7/MyD88/IRF5 signaling pathway, ultimately aggravating I/R injury.","['Brain–heart interaction', 'Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion', 'Sympathetic outflow', 'Toll-like receptor 7', 'Ventromedial hypothalamus']",2022-11-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cells proliferation, oxidative stress and apoptosis were analyzed.Our results in vivo showed that the renal damage induced by IR was ameliorated by genistein pretreatment. Moreover, ADORA2A was activated by genistein, along with inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis. The results in vitro showed that genistein pretreatment and ADORA2A overexpression reversed the increase of apoptosis and oxidative stress in NRK-52E cells induced by H/R, while the knockdown of ADORA2A partially weakened this reversal from genistein treatment.Our results demonstrated that genistein have a protective effect against renal IRI by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptosis via activating ADORA2A, presenting its potential use for the treatment of renal IRI.","['Genistein', 'apoptosis', 'renal ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'renal tubular epithelial cells']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, previous studies report impaired cell function associated with administering freeze-thawed MSCs as single cell suspensions, potentially compromising reliable therapeutic efficacy. Using long-term culture-adapted clinical-grade clonal human bone marrow MSCs (cBMSCs) in this study, we engineered cBMSC sheets in 24 h to provide rapid preparation. We then sought to determine the influence of cBMSC freeze-thawing on both in vitro production of pro-regenerative factors and in vivo ability to reduce renal fibrosis in a rat model compared to freshly harvested cBMSCs. Sheets from freeze-thawed cBMSCs sheets exhibited comparable in vitro protein production and gene expression of pro-regenerative factors [e.g., hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and interleukin 10 (IL-10)] to freshly harvested cBMSC sheets. Additionally, freeze-thawed cBMSC sheets successfully suppressed renal fibrosis in vivo in an established rat ischemia-reperfusion injury model. Despite previous studies reporting that freeze-thawed MSCs exhibit impaired cell functions compared to fresh MSC single cell suspensions, cell sheets engineered from freeze-thawed cBMSCs do not exhibit impaired cell functions, supporting critical steps toward future clinical translation of cBMSC-based kidney disease treatment.",[],2022-09-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischaemia (mTICI) score was used to evaluate reperfusion outcomes. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with poor 90-day outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3-6).The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) median score of the 66 patients at admission was 15. Twelve patients (18.2%) showed thrombus migration to the M1 segment or proximal M2 during EVT and underwent additional intracranial thrombectomy. Successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) was achieved in 60 patients (90.9%) and complete reperfusion (mTICI 3) in 42 (63.6%). A poor functional outcome was seen in 27 patients (40.9%).

36931487,The accumulated oxygen deficit as an indicator of the ischemic retinal insult.,"We here attempt to improve quantification of the ischemic retinal insult, that is, what is imposed on the retinal tissue by ischemia, especially in experimental models of ischemia. The ischemic retinal insult initiates the ischemic retinal injury (or outcome). Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that the better the quantification of the insult, the better the correlation with, and thereby estimation of, the injury. The insult seldom has been quantified in terms of the relevant physiological factors, especially in connection with the rate of oxygen delivery (DO2). We here propose the accumulated oxygen deficit (AO2D) as an indicator of the ischemic retinal insult. We hypothesized that AO2D is correlated with the rate of oxygen metabolism measured 1 h after reperfusion following an episode of ischemia (MO2_1_Hr). Previously, we showed that MO2_1_Hr is related to the electroretinogram amplitude and the retinal thickness when they are measured seven days after reperfusion. We studied 27 rats, as well as 26 rats from our published data on retinal ischemia in which we had measurements of DO2 and duration of ischemia (T) of various levels and durations. We also measured DO2 in 29 rats treated with sham surgery. Ischemia was induced by either ipsilateral or bilateral common carotid artery occlusion or by ophthalmic artery occlusion, which gave a wide range of DO2. DO2 and MO2_1_Hr were evaluated based on three types of images: 1) red-free images to measure vessel diameters, 2) fluorescence images to estimate blood velocities by the displacement of intravascular fluorescent microspheres over time, and 3) phosphorescence images to quantify vascular oxygen tension from the phosphorescence lifetime of an intravascular oxygen sensitive phosphor. Loss of oxygen delivery (DO2L) was calculated as the difference between DO2 under normal/sham condition and DO2 during ischemia. AO2D, a volume of oxygen, was calculated as the product DO2L and T. Including all data, the linear relationship between AO2D and MO2_1_Hr was significant (R2 = 0.261, P = 0.0003). Limiting data to that in which T or DO2L was maximal also yielded significant relationships, and revealed that DO2L at a long duration of ischemia contributed disproportionately more than T to MO2_1_Hr. We discuss the potential of AO2D for quantifying the ischemic retinal insult, predicting the ischemic retinal injury and evaluating the likelihood of infarction.","['Imaging', 'Retinal blood flow', 'Retinal ischemia', 'Retinal oxygen delivery', 'Retinal oxygen metabolism']",2022-09-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36931194,Too much of a good thing: The case of SOCE in cellular apoptosis.,"Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is an essential second messenger in eukaryotic cells regulating numerous cellular functions such as contraction, secretion, immunity, growth, and metabolism. Ca2+ signaling is also a key signal transducer in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. The store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway (SOCE) is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells, and is the primary Ca2+ influx pathway in non-excitable cells. SOCE is mediated by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensing STIM proteins, and the plasma membrane Ca2+-selective Orai channels. A growing number of studies have implicated SOCE in regulating cell death primarily via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in a variety of tissues and in response to physiological stressors such as traumatic brain injury, ischemia reperfusion injury, sepsis, and alcohol toxicity. Notably, the literature points to excessive cytosolic Ca2+ influx through SOCE in vulnerable cells as a key factor tipping the balance towards cellular apoptosis. While the literature primarily addresses the functions of STIM1 and Orai1, STIM2, Orai2 and Orai3 are also emerging as potential regulators of cell death. Here, we review the functions of STIM and Orai proteins in regulating cell death and the implications of this regulation to human pathologies.","['Apoptosis', 'CRAC', 'Calcium signaling', 'Orai', 'SOCE', 'STIM']",2023-02-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Epac/Rap1 signaling pathway is important in mediating endothelial cell barrier function. This study will investigate the regulatory role of Epac/Rap1 signaling pathway in BBB disruption after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury. CI/R model was induced by 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in male C57BL/6J mice.

The results showed that CI/R injured the tight connection of BBB and evoked the suppression of the Epac/Rap1 signaling pathway. Based on Epac activation with a cAMP analogue, 8-CPT could improve BBB disfunction by increasing the expression of tight junction protein and reducing the formation of stress fibers. In addition, 8-CPT could ameliorate neurobehavioral disorders, cerebral edema, and cerebral infarction volume in MCAO mice. Moreover, inhibition of Epac pathway with Rap1 inhibitor GGTI298 and Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 could aggravate the damage of BBB and cerebral injury accordingly. Our results indicate that, the activation of Epac/Rap1 signaling pathway has neuroprotective effects on CI/R damaged brain, through the recovery of BBB.","['8-CPT-2ʹ-O-Me-cAMP', 'Blood-brain barrier', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'Epac/Rap1 signaling pathway', 'Filamentous actin', 'Tight junction']",2023-02-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36930590,Magnetic Response Combined with Bioactive Ion Therapy: A RONS-Scavenging Theranostic Nanoplatform for Thrombolysis and Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Currently, the limited efficacy of antithrombotic treatments is attributed to the inadequacy of pure drugs and the low ability of drugs to target the thrombus site. More importantly, timely thrombolysis is essential to reduce the sequelae of cardiovascular disease, but ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remains a major challenge that must be solved after blood flow recovery. Herein, a multifunctional therapeutic nanoparticle (NP) based on Fe3O4 and strontium ions encapsulated in mesoporous polydopamine was successfully constructed and then loaded with TNK-tPA (FeM@Sr-TNK NPs). The NPs (59.9 min) significantly prolonged the half-life of thrombolytic drugs, which was 3.04 times that of TNK (19.7 min), and they had good biological safety. The NPs were shown to pass through vascular models with different inner diameters, curvatures, and stenosis under magnetic targeting and to enable accurate diagnosis of thrombi by photoacoustic imaging. NPs combined with the magnetic hyperthermia technique were used to accelerate thrombolysis and quickly open blocked blood vessels. Then, renal IRI-induced functional metabolic disorder and tissue damage were evidently attenuated by scavenging toxic reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and through the protective effects of bioactive ion therapy, including reduced apoptosis, increased angiogenesis, and inhibited fibrosis. In brief, we constructed a multifunctional nanoplatform for integrating a ""diagnosis-therapy-protection"" approach to achieve comprehensive management from thrombus to renal IRI, promoting the advancement of related technologies.","['bioactive ion therapy', 'ischemia−reperfusion injury', 'magnetic response', 'reactive oxygen and nitrogen species', 'thrombolysis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36930536,The healing effect of topical tea tree oil on pressure ulcers in a rat model.,"Objective: The effects of topical tea tree oil (TTO) on the healing of pressure ulcers (PUs) in an animal model was evaluated. Method: To induce PUs, ischaemia-reperfusion cycles were performed by the external application of magnetic plates, with an ischaemic period of eight hours and a reperfusion period of 16 hours. Male and female Wistar rats were divided into three equally sized groups (n=20): one group received topical glycerin twice daily, another group received topical 10% (volume/volume (v/v)) TTO in glycerin twice daily; and the remaining group was untreated. The animals were assessed after one, four, seven and 14 cycles of ischaemia-reperfusion by thermal camera imaging, and then euthanised and sampled to investigate the degree of inflammation, collagen synthesis and apoptosis in the PUs. Results: Although topical glycerin alone suppressed local inflammation and apoptosis, this suppressive effect was accentuated at all timepoints by the application of topical TTO + glycerin. Similarly, an increase in collagen synthesis was observed in the glycerin group and this was accentuated by TTO at all timepoints. Parallel to the histological findings, the local temperature had decreased significantly on days 4 and 7 for both treatment groups (glycerin and TTO+glycerin). Conclusion: In this study, treatment with 10% (v/v) TTO in glycerin effectively suppressed skin inflammation and apoptosis, while it increased collagen synthesis during PU formation.","['Animal model', 'Glycerin', 'Pressure ulcer', 'Tea tree oil', 'Wound', 'Wound care', 'Wound dressing', 'Wound healing']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36930425,The Role of Ferroptosis in Placental-Related Diseases.,"Ferroptosis is a recently identified form of programmed cell death which is different from apoptosis, pyroptosis, necrosis, and autophagy. It is uniquely defined by redox-active iron-dependent hydroxy-peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing phospholipids and a loss of lipid peroxidation repair capacity. Ferroptosis has recently been implicated in multiple human diseases, such as tumors, ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute kidney injury, neurological diseases, and asthma among others. Intriguingly, ferroptosis is associated with placental physiology and trophoblast injury. Circumstances such as accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to hypoxia-reperfusion and anoxia-reoxygenation of trophoblast during placental development, the abundance of trophoblastic iron and PUFA, physiological uterine contractions, or pathological placental bed perfusion, cause placental trophoblasts' susceptibility to ferroptosis. Ferroptosis of trophoblast can cause placental dysfunction, which may be involved in the occurrence and development of placenta-related diseases such as gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and abortion. The regulatory mechanisms of trophoblastic ferroptosis still need to be explored further. Here, we summarize the latest progress in trophoblastic ferroptosis research on placental-related diseases, provide references for further understanding of its pathogenesis, and propose new strategies for the prevention and treatment of placental-related diseases.","['Ferroptosis', 'Iron', 'Lipid peroxidation', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy']",2022-10-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36930231,The impact of time-of-day reperfusion on remote ischemic conditioning in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: a RIC-STEMI substudy.,"Daytime variation affects the tolerance of cardiomyocytes to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). This study aims to evaluate the impact of time-of-day reperfusion on clinical outcomes of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) as an adjuvant to primary percutaneous coronary intervention(PPCI) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction(STEMI) patients. A post-hoc analysis of a prospective, single-center parallel 1:1 randomized trial (RIC-STEMI) was performed. This analysis included 448 STEMI patients previously randomized to either PPCI alone (PPCI group) (n = 217) or RIC as an adjuvant to PPCI (RIC + PPCI group) (n = 231). Moreover, the sample was divided according to the time of PPCI: night-morning (22 h-11h59min) (n = 216) or afternoon (12 h-21h59min) (n = 232) groups. The primary follow-up endpoint was a composite of cardiac death and hospitalization due to heart failure. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics and the follow-up outcomes between groups. The afternoon period (HR = 0.474; 95% CI 0.230-0.977; p = 0.043) and RIC (HR = 0.423; 95% CI 0.195-0.917; p = 0.029) were independent predictors of the primary follow-up endpoint. An univariate analysis showed a lower frequency of primary follow-up endpoint, just in the afternoon period (10.3%vs0.9%; p = 0.002), in the RIC + PPCI group. A multivariate analysis revealed that RIC was an independent predictor of the primary follow-up endpoint in the afternoon group (HR = 0.098; 95% CI 0.012-0.785; p = 0.029), but not in the night-morning group. In addition, the afternoon period was not an independent predictor of the primary follow-up endpoint when the multivariate analysis was performed in the PPCI group. In conclusion, this study showed an important cardioprotective effect of RIC, namely in the afternoon period, suggesting that the afternoon period enhances the cardioprotection induced by RIC.","['Cardiac death', 'Heart failure', 'Remote ischemic conditioning', 'ST-elevation myocardial infarction', 'Time-of-day']",2022-07-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36930070,Twenty-minute harvesting of flow-through type vastus lateralis muscle flap significantly reduces the need for a temporary intravascular shunt in the treatment of severe upper extremity trauma in civilian patients.,"For the reconstruction of severe upper extremity trauma involving arterial injury in civilian patients, it is generally recommended that the revascularization time be shortened using a temporary intravascular shunt (TIVS). However, if a flow-through type vastus lateralis muscle (VLm) flap can be harvested in 20 minutes and bypassed at the obstructed ischemic zone within 30 minutes, blood flow can be restored as quickly or more quickly than when using a TIVS, eliminating the need for a TIVS. This procedure was applied in the reconstruction of 3 cases of severe extremity trauma with vascular injury. The mean age was 69.7 years. Surgery was started an average of 2.93 hours from the onset. The average flap harvest time was 0.33 hours. The average time to revascularization from flap harvest was 1.33 hours, the average total operation time was 6.43 hours, and all upper extremities were salvaged. No cases showed ischemia-reperfusion injury or severe muscle contracture. The flow-through-type VLm flap can be applicable as a bypass graft for a 20 cm defect at any region distal to the elbow. In addition, harvesting the flap attached to blood-rich muscle not only controls the infection of contaminated wounds through the filling of dead space, but also has the potential to replace damaged muscle or tendon tissue. Even though TIVS placement is currently used extensively in this field of treatment, its role could be significantly reduced if a flow-through-type VLm flap can be harvested within 20 minutes.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36927808,Remote ischemic preconditioning protects against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice by activating NMDAR/AMPK/PGC-1α/SIRT3 signaling.,"To study the protective effects of delayed remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (SCIRI) in mice and determine whether SIRT3 is involved in this protection and portrayed its upstream regulatory mechanisms.In vivo, WT or SIRT3 global knockout (KO) mice were exposed to right upper and lower limbs RIPC or sham ischemia. After 24 h, the abdominal aorta was clamped for 20 min, then re-perfused for 3 days. The motor function of mice, number of Nissl bodies, apoptotic rate of neurons, and related indexes of oxidative stress in the spinal cord were measured to evaluate for neuroprotective effects. The expression and correlation of SIRT3 and NMDAR were detected by WB and immunofluorescence. In vitro, primary neurons were exacted and OGD/R was performed to simulate SCIRI in vivo. Neuronal damage was assessed by observing neuron morphology, detecting LDH release ratio, and flow cytometry to analyze the apoptosis. MnSOD and CAT enzyme activities, GSH and ROS level were also measured to assess neuronal antioxidant capacity. NMDAR-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling was detected by WB to portray upstream regulatory mechanisms of RIPC regulating SIRT3.Compared to the SCIRI mice without RIPC, mice with RIPC displayed improved motor function recovery, a reduced neuronal loss, and enhanced antioxidant capacity. To the contrary, the KO mice did not exhibit any effect of RIPC-induced neuroprotection. Similar results were observed in vitro. Further analyses with spinal cord tissues or primary neurons detected enhanced MnSOD and CAT activities, as well as increased GSH level but decreased MDA or ROS production in the RIPC + I/R mice or NMDA + OGD/R neurons. However, these changes were completely inhibited by the absence of SIRT3. Additionally, NMDAR-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling was activated to upregulate SIRT3 levels, which is essential for RIPC-mediated neuroprotection.RIPC enhances spinal cord ischemia tolerance in a SIRT3-dependent manner, and its induced elevated SIRT3 levels are mediated by the NMDAR-AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway. Combined therapy targeting SIRT3 is a promising direction for treating SCIRI.","['Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Oxidative stress', 'RIPC', 'SIRT3']",2022-10-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36927176,The evolution of blood-brain barrier permeability changes after stroke and its implications on clinical outcome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBp) is a key process involved in ischemic stroke pathophysiology. However, there is a lack of consensus on how BBBp evolves after the ischemia injury, and its clinical relevance at different timepoints post stroke.The main objective of this study is to assess BBBp evolution through stroke phases and its implications on patient outcomes.We screened PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to 31 December 2021. We included research quantitatively using neuroimaging to assess BBBp in stroke patients. BBBp in the different phases was evaluated by a random-effect model based on the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides of the brain. We performed a subgroup analysis on clinical outcome, reperfusion treatment, haemorrhagic transformation, and imaging method.We identified 3761 studies, of which 22 (1592 patients and 1787 evaluations) were included in our study. Overall, 17 studies reported BBBp for the hyperacute phase, 8 for the acute, 5 for the subacute, and 2 for the chronic phase. All phases were associated with increased BBBp: 0.74 (0.48-0.99), 1.68 (0.94-2.42), 1.98 (0.96-3.00), and 1.00 (0.45-1.55), respectively. An increase in BBBp was associated with hemorrhagic transformation in the hyperacute phase and with improved functional outcomes in the late subacute phase.BBBp is persistently increased after stroke, peaking in the acute and subacute phases. The degree of BBBp influences patient outcomes depending on stroke phase. Our findings support the clinical relevance of BBBp dynamics in stroke care.","['Meta-analysis', 'blood–brain barrier', 'stroke']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36926953,Left Atrial Remodeling Following ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Correlates With Infarct Size and Age Older Than 70 Years.,"Background Following myocardial infarction, left ventricular remodeling (LVR) is associated with heart failure and cardiac death. At the same time, left atrial (LA) remodeling (LAR) is an essential part of the outcome of a wide spectrum of cardiac conditions. The authors sought to evaluate the correlates of LAR and its relationships with LVR after myocardial infarction. Methods and Results This is a retrospective analysis of 320 of 443 patients enrolled for study of LVR after ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Left ventricular (LV) volumes, infarct size and LA volume index were assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging during index hospitalization (day 6 [interquartile range, 4-8]) and after a 3-month follow-up. LAR was studied using a linear mixed model for repeated measurements. Overall, there was a decrease in LA volume index between 6 days and 3 months (43.9±10.4 mL versus 42.8±11.1 mL, P=0.003). Patients with changes in LA volume index >8% over time were older, with greater body mass index, lower LV ejection fraction, and larger infarct size. Unadjusted predictors of LAR were age older than 70 years, infarct size, anterior infarction, time to reperfusion, history of hypertension, LV end-diastolic volume, and heart failure at day 6. Independent correlates were age older than 70 years (3.24±1.33, P=0.015) and infarct size (2.16±0.72 per 10% LV, P<0.001). LA remodeling was correlated with LV remodeling (r=0.372, P<0.001), but neither LA nor LV volumes at day 6 were related to LVR or LAR, respectively. Conclusions The authors found LA changes to occur in the months after myocardial infarction, with an overall decrease in LA volumes. While LAR coincided with LVR, the correlates for LAR were age older than 70 years and larger infarct size.","['cardiac magnetic resonance imaging', 'left atrial remodeling', 'myocardial infarction']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36926729,Genetic modification of miR-34a enhances efficacy of transplanted human dental pulp stem cells after ischemic stroke.,"Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) promote recovery after ischemic stroke; however, the therapeutic efficacy is limited by the poor survival of transplanted cells. For in vitro experiments in the present study, we used oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation in hDPSCs to mimic cell damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion. We found that miRNA-34a-5p (miR-34a) was elevated under oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation conditions in hDPSCs. Inhibition of miR-34a facilitated the proliferation and antioxidant capacity and reduced the apoptosis of hDPSCs. Moreover, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed WNT1 and SIRT1 as the targets of miR-34a. In miR-34a knockdown cell lines, WNT1 suppression reduced cell proliferation, and SIRT1 suppression decreased the antioxidant capacity. Together, these results indicated that miR-34a regulates cell proliferation and antioxidant stress via targeting WNT1 and SIRT1, respectively. For in vivo experiments, we injected genetically modified hDPSCs (anti34a-hDPSCs) into the brains of mice. We found that anti34a-hDPSCs significantly inhibited apoptosis, reduced cerebral edema and cerebral infarct volume, and improved motor function in mice. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of the cell proliferation and antioxidant capacity of hDPSCs, and suggests a potential gene that can be targeted to improve the survival rate and efficacy of transplanted hDPSCs in brain after ischemic stroke.","['HO-1', 'Nrf2', 'SIRT1', 'WNT1', 'antioxidant capacity', 'human dental pulp stem cells', 'ischemic stroke', 'miR-34a', 'proliferation', 'β-catenin']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36926720,Neuroprotective effects of meloxicam on transient brain ischemia in rats: the two faces of anti-inflammatory treatments.,"The inflammatory response plays an important role in neuroprotection and regeneration after ischemic insult. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has been a matter of debate as to whether they have beneficial or detrimental effects. In this context, the effects of the anti-inflammatory agent meloxicam have been scarcely documented after stroke, but its ability to inhibit both cyclooxygenase isoforms (1 and 2) could be a promising strategy to modulate post-ischemic inflammation. This study analyzed the effect of meloxicam in a transient focal cerebral ischemia model in rats, measuring its neuroprotective effect after 48 hours and 7 days of reperfusion and the effects of the treatment on the glial scar and regenerative events such as the generation of new progenitors in the subventricular zone and axonal sprouting at the edge of the damaged area. We show that meloxicam's neuroprotective effects remained after 7 days of reperfusion even if its administration was restricted to the two first days after ischemia. Moreover, meloxicam treatment modulated glial scar reactivity, which matched with an increase in axonal sprouting. However, this treatment decreased the formation of neuronal progenitor cells. This study discusses the dual role of anti-inflammatory treatments after stroke and encourages the careful analysis of both the neuroprotective and the regenerative effects in preclinical studies.","['anti-inflammatories', 'astrocyte', 'axonal sprouting', 'cylinder test', 'doublecortin', 'focal brain ischemia', 'glial scar', 'inflammation', 'neuroprotection', 'new neuron generation', 'transient stroke']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36926615,Ginsenoside compound K reduces ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting PTP1B-mediated IRS1 tyrosine dephosphorylation.,"Ginsenoside compound K (CK) stimulated activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling is one of the major mechanisms in promoting cell survival after stroke. However, the underlying mediators remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the docking protein of ginsenoside CK mediating the neuroprotective effects.Molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance, and cellular thermal shift assay were performed to explore ginsenoside CK interacting proteins. Neuroscreen-1 cells and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats were utilized as in-vitro and in-vivo models.Ginsenoside CK interacted with recombinant human PTP1B protein and impaired its tyrosine phosphatase activity. Pathway and process enrichment analysis confirmed the involvement of PTP1B and its interacting proteins in PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. PTP1B overexpression reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in neuroscreen-1 cells. These regulations were confirmed in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere of the rat brains after MCAO/R. Ginsenoside CK treatment reversed these alterations and attenuated neuronal apoptosis.Ginsenoside CK binds to PTP1B with a high affinity and inhibits PTP1B-mediated IRS1 tyrosine dephosphorylation. This novel mechanism helps explain the role of ginsenoside CK in activating the neuronal protective PI3K-Akt signaling pathway after ischemia-reperfusion injury.","['PI3K-Akt signaling', 'PTP1B', 'ginsenoside CK', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'stroke']",2022-05-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36926612,Notoginseng leaf triterpenes ameliorates mitochondrial oxidative injury via the NAMPT-SIRT1/2/3 signaling pathways in cerebral ischemic model rats.,"Due to the interrupted blood supply in cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS), ischemic and hypoxia results in neuronal depolarization, insufficient NAD+, excessive levels of ROS, mitochondrial damages, and energy metabolism disorders, which triggers the ischemic cascades. Currently, improvement of mitochondrial functions and energy metabolism is as a vital therapeutic target and clinical strategy. Hence, it is greatly crucial to look for neuroprotective natural agents with mitochondria protection actions and explore the mediated targets for treating CIS. In the previous study, notoginseng leaf triterpenes (PNGL) from Panax notoginseng stems and leaves was demonstrated to have neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the potential mechanisms have been not completely elaborate. Methods: The model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) was adopted to verify the neuroprotective effects and potential pharmacology mechanisms of PNGL in vivo. Antioxidant markers were evaluated by kit detection. Mitochondrial function was evaluated by ATP content measurement, ATPase, NAD and NADH kits. And the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and pathological staining (H&E and Nissl) were used to detect cerebral morphological changes and mitochondrial structural damages. Western blotting, ELISA and immunofluorescence assay were utilized to explore the mitochondrial protection effects and its related mechanisms in vivo. Results: In vivo, treatment with PNGL markedly reduced excessive oxidative stress, inhibited mitochondrial injury, alleviated energy metabolism dysfunction, decreased neuronal loss and apoptosis, and thus notedly raised neuronal survival under ischemia and hypoxia. Meanwhile, PNGL significantly increased the expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) in the ischemic regions, and regulated its related downstream SIRT1/2/3-MnSOD/PGC-1α pathways. Conclusion: The study finds that the mitochondrial protective effects of PNGL are associated with the NAMPT-SIRT1/2/3-MnSOD/PGC-1α signal pathways. PNGL, as a novel candidate drug, has great application prospects for preventing and treating ischemic stroke.","['Energy metabolism', 'Ischemia stroke', 'Mitochondria', 'NAMPT', 'Notoginseng leaf triterpenes (PNGL)']",2020-05-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36926337,Hypothermic machine perfusion alleviates ischemia-reperfusion injury of intestinal transplantation in pigs.,"Intestinal transplantation (IT) has become an important procedure for the treatment of irreversible intestinal failure. However, IT is extremely vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Due to the limitations of static cold storage (SCS), hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) is rapidly gaining popularity. In this study, the intestinal HMP system is established and HMP is compared with SCS.An intestinal HMP system was built. Ten miniature pigs were randomly divided into the HMP and SCS groups, and their intestines were perfused using the HMP device and SCS, respectively, followed by orthotopic auto-transplantation. Analysis was done on the grafts between the two groups.Operation success rates of the surgery were 100% in both groups. The 7-day survival rate was 100% in the HMP group, which was significantly higher than that of the SCS group (20%, P< 0.05). The pathological results showed that fewer injuries of grafts were in the HMP group. Endotoxin (ET), IL-1, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α levels in the HMP group were significantly lower than in the SCS group (P<0.05), whereas IL-10 levels were significantly higher (P<0.05).The intestinal expression levels of ZO-1 and Occludin were higher in the HMP group compared to the SCS group, whereas Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and caspase-3 were lower.In this study, we established a stable intestinal HMP system and demonstrated that HMP could significantly alleviate intestinal IRI and improve the outcome after IT.","['TLR4/NF κB pathway', 'hypothermic machine perfusion', 'intestinal transplantation', 'ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury', 'pig']",2022-12-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

36924057,Long noncoding RNAs induced control of ferroptosis: Implications in cancer progression and treatment.,"A novel kind of nonapoptotic, iron-dependent cell death brought on by lipid peroxidation is known as ferroptosis. Numerous pathological processes, including neurotoxicity, neurological disorders, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and particularly cancer, have been demonstrated to be influenced by changes in the ferroptosis-regulating network. Recent studies have established the critical roles that ferroptosis can play in cancer development and the evolution of resistance to standard chemoradiotherapy, thus suggesting that ferroptosis may be a feasible therapeutic strategy for cancer management. Gene expression may be regulated at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). They have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Some lncRNAs participate in the biological process of ferroptosis, which represents an exciting alternative to regulate ferroptosis as a means of cancer therapy. Even though there is evidence that lncRNAs have a mechanistic role in the ferroptosis of cancer cells, research on the mechanism and potential treatments for these lncRNAs is still lacking. We elucidate the potential mechanisms by which lncRNAs modulate ferroptosis in cancer and examine the promise and challenges of employing lncRNAs as novel therapeutic targets in cancer.","['Cancer', 'ferroptosis', 'lncRNA-based therapies', 'lncRNAs']",2023-01-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36923943,Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6 suppresses presenilin-2 to preserve mitochondrial integrity after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) damage is characterized by mitochondrial damage in cardiomyocytes. Transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing 6 (TMBIM6) and presenilin-2 (PS2) participate in multiple mitochondrial pathways; thus, we investigated the impact of these proteins on mitochondrial homeostasis during an acute reperfusion injury. Myocardial post-ischemic reperfusion stress impaired myocardial function, induced structural abnormalities and promoted cardiomyocyte death by disrupting the mitochondrial integrity in wild-type mice, but not in TMBIM6 transgenic mice. We found that TMBIM6 bound directly to PS2 and promoted its post-transcriptional degradation. Knocking out PS2 in mice reduced I/R injury-induced cardiac dysfunction, inflammatory responses, myocardial swelling and cardiomyocyte death by improving the mitochondrial integrity. These findings demonstrate that sufficient TMBIM6 expression can prevent PS2 accumulation during cardiac I/R injury, thus suppressing reperfusion-induced mitochondrial damage. Therefore, TMBIM6 and PS2 are promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of cardiac reperfusion damage.","['PS2', 'TMBIM6', 'cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'mitochondria']",2022-11-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36923529,WT1+ glomerular parietal epithelial progenitors promote renal proximal tubule regeneration after severe acute kidney injury.,"Rationale: Mammalian renal proximal tubules can partially regenerate after acute kidney injury (AKI). However, cells participating in the renal proximal tubule regeneration remain to be elucidated. Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) expresses in a subtype of glomeruli parietal epithelial cells (PECs) in adult kidneys, it remains unclear whether these WT1+ PECs play a role in renal regeneration/repair after AKI. Methods: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mouse model was used to investigate the expression pattern of WT1 in the kidney after severe AKI. Conditional deletion of WT1 gene mice were generated using Pax8CreERT2 and WT1fl/fl mice to examine the function of WT1. Then, genetic cell lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing were performed to illustrate that WT1+ PECs develop into WT1+ proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Furthermore, in vitro clonogenicity, direct differentiation analysis and in vivo transplantation were used to reveal the stem cell-like properties of these WT1+ PECs. Results: The expression of WT1 protein in PECs and PTECs was increased after severe AKI. Conditional deletion of WT1 gene in PTECs and PECs aggravated renal tubular injury after severe AKI. WT1+ PECs develop into WT1+ PTECs via the transient scattered tubular cell stage, and these WT1+ PECs possess specific stem cell-like properties. Conclusions: We discovered a group of WT1+ PECs that promote renal proximal tubule regeneration/repair after severe AKI, and the expression of WT1 in PECs and PTECs is essential for renal proximal tubule regeneration after severe kidney injury.","['WT1', 'acute kidney injury', 'parietal epithelial cells', 'regeneration', 'renal progenitors']",2022-09-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The dissection flap was fenestrated endovascularly with the placement of a covered stent in the right common iliac artery. After 10 years, the dissection remains stable with a minimal increase in the aorta size. The stent is patent with no lower extremity symptoms or reintervention.

36922820,Exogenous mitochondrial transplantation improves survival and neurological outcomes after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.,"Mitochondrial transplantation (MTx) is an emerging but poorly understood technology with the potential to mitigate severe ischemia-reperfusion injuries after cardiac arrest (CA). To address critical gaps in the current knowledge, we test the hypothesis that MTx can improve outcomes after CA resuscitation.This study consists of both in vitro and in vivo studies. We initially examined the migration of exogenous mitochondria into primary neural cell culture in vitro. Exogenous mitochondria extracted from the brain and muscle tissues of donor rats and endogenous mitochondria in the neural cells were separately labeled before co-culture. After a period of 24 h following co-culture, mitochondrial transfer was observed using microscopy. In vitro adenosine triphosphate (ATP) contents were assessed between freshly isolated and frozen-thawed mitochondria to compare their effects on survival. Our main study was an in vivo rat model of CA in which rats were subjected to 10 min of asphyxial CA followed by resuscitation. At the time of achieving successful resuscitation, rats were randomly assigned into one of three groups of intravenous injections: vehicle, frozen-thawed, or fresh viable mitochondria. During 72 h post-CA, the therapeutic efficacy of MTx was assessed by comparison of survival rates. The persistence of labeled donor mitochondria within critical organs of recipient animals 24 h post-CA was visualized via microscopy.The donated mitochondria were successfully taken up into cultured neural cells. Transferred exogenous mitochondria co-localized with endogenous mitochondria inside neural cells. ATP content in fresh mitochondria was approximately four times higher than in frozen-thawed mitochondria. In the in vivo survival study, freshly isolated functional mitochondria, but not frozen-thawed mitochondria, significantly increased 72-h survival from 55 to 91% (P = 0.048 vs. vehicle). The beneficial effects on survival were associated with improvements in rapid recovery of arterial lactate and glucose levels, cerebral microcirculation, lung edema, and neurological function. Labeled mitochondria were observed inside the vital organs of the surviving rats 24 h post-CA.MTx performed immediately after resuscitation improved survival and neurological recovery in post-CA rats. These results provide a foundation for future studies to promote the development of MTx as a novel therapeutic strategy to save lives currently lost after CA.","['Cardiac arrest', 'Ischemia and reperfusion', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial transplantation']",2022-10-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36922653,Ferroptotic mechanisms and therapeutic targeting of iron metabolism and lipid peroxidation in the kidney.,"Ferroptosis is a mechanism of regulated necrotic cell death characterized by iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-driven membrane destruction that can be inhibited by glutathione peroxidase 4. Morphologically, it is characterized by cellular, organelle and cytoplasmic swelling and the loss of plasma membrane integrity, with the release of intracellular components. Ferroptosis is triggered in cells with dysregulated iron and thiol redox metabolism, whereby the initial robust but selective accumulation of hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids is further propagated through enzymatic and non-enzymatic secondary mechanisms, leading to formation of oxidatively truncated electrophilic species and their adducts with proteins. Thus, ferroptosis is dependent on the convergence of iron, thiol and lipid metabolic pathways. The kidney is particularly susceptible to redox imbalance. A growing body of evidence has linked ferroptosis to acute kidney injury in the context of diverse stimuli, such as ischaemia-reperfusion, sepsis or toxins, and to chronic kidney disease, suggesting that ferroptosis may represent a novel therapeutic target for kidney disease. However, further work is needed to address gaps in our understanding of the triggers, execution and spreading mechanisms of ferroptosis.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36922458,Stellate ganglion block suppresses hippocampal ferroptosis to attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury via the Hippo pathway.,"Ischemic stroke is a disabling and fatal disease caused by the insufficient blood supply to the brain. Stellate ganglion block (SGB) is a type of anesthesia commonly used to relieve pain. Here, we sought to identify the effects of SGB on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established in rats. The brain injury was assessed using the 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium-chloride (TTC) staining assay and neurological score. Ferroptosis was analyzed by detecting cell death, Fe2+ content, glutathione (GSH), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ferroptosis-related factors. The mechanisms of SGB were assessed using the western blot. The results showed that I/R increased brain infarction and damaged neurological function. SGB decreased I/R-induced infarction and improved neurological function. Meantime, SGB inhibited ferroptosis of the hippocampus induced by I/R via the Hippo pathway. and the Yes1 associated transcriptional regulator (YAP) of this pathway was positively correlated with the ferroptosis-related solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11). Inhibition of the Hippo pathway reversed the effects of SGB on brain injury and ferroptosis. In conclusion, SGB inhibited ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons via activating the Hippo pathway and thereby alleviated I/R injury. The data provide a novel insight into the treatment of ischemic stroke and even other ischemic encephalopathies.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Ferroptosis', 'Hippo pathway', 'Stellate ganglion block']",2022-11-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921749,Regadenoson Reduces Soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products in Lung Recipients.,"The selective adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonist regadenoson reduces inflammation due to lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The objective of this study was to investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms by which regadenoson reduces IRI in lung transplant recipients.Fourteen human lung transplant recipients were infused for 12 hours with regadenoson and 7 more served as untreated controls. Plasma levels of high mobility group box 1 and its soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products (sRAGE) were measured by Luminex. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 were measured by gelatin zymography. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 was measured by mass spectroscopy. A2AR expression on leukocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry. MMP-9-mediated cleavage of RAGE was evaluated using cultured macrophages in vitro.Regadenoson treatment during lung transplantation significantly reduced levels of MMP-9 (P < .05), but not MMP-2, and elevated levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (P < .05), an endogenous selective inhibitor of MMP-9. Regadenoson infusion significantly reduced plasma levels of sRAGE (P < .05) during lung reperfusion compared with control subjects. A2AR expression was highest on invariant natural killer T cells and higher on monocytes than other circulating immune cells (P < .05). The shedding of RAGE from cultured monocytes/macrophages was increased by MMP-9 stimulation and reduced by an MMP inhibitor or by A2AR agonists, regadenoson or ATL146e.In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that A2AR activation reduces sRAGE in part by inhibiting MMP-9 production by monocytes/macrophages. These results suggest a novel molecular mechanism by which A2AR agonists reduce primary graft dysfunction.",[],2022-10-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921741,Inter-synergized neuroprotection of costunolide engineered bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells targeting system.,"Treatment of stroke remains difficult due to the unsatisfactory or unlocalized delivery of small molecule- and cell-based therapeutics in injured brain tissues. This is particularly the case for costunolide (Cos), which is highly neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory but finds great difficulty in reaching the brain. Here, we present that Cos induces the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bMSCs) into glia-like cells (C-bMSCs) capable of secreting neurotrophic factors and homing to injured brain tissues. By taking advantage of the homing effect, Cos and C-bMSCs were simultaneously funneled into the damaged brain by: (i) preparing Cos micelles (Cos-M) through entrapping Cos into the amphiphilic copolymer mPEG-PLGA [poly(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether-poly(lactide-co-glycolide)], and (ii) incorporating Cos-M into C-bMSCs to give an intravenously injectable cell-like composite termed Cos@C-bMSCs, which displayed the inter-synergized neuroprotective efficacy in the cerebral ischemia reperfusion (CIR) injured rats. As desired, in the injured brain area, Cos@C-bMSCs simultaneously released Cos and C-bMSCs (glia-like cells) to repair the injured brain and to secret neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF). In view of the availability and reliability of autologous MSCs, the proof-of-concept design, development, and in vivo efficacy of Cos@C-bMSCs signify a movement in our management of brain damages.","['Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells', 'Costunolide', 'Inter-promoted neuroprotection', 'Recellularization', 'Stroke']",2022-10-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921723,Preventing ischemia-reperfusion injury by acousto-mechanical local oxygen delivery.,"Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a pathological process that causes vascular damage and dysfunction which increases recurrence and/or mortality in myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and organ transplantation. We hypothesized that ultrasound-stimulated oxygen-loaded microbubble (O2-MB) cavitation would enhance mechanical force on endothelium and simultaneously release oxygen locally at the targeted vessels. This cooperation between biomechanical and biochemical stimuli might modulate endothelial metabolism, providing a potential clinical approach to the prevention of I/R injury. Murine hindlimb and cardiac I/R models were used to demonstrate the feasibility of injury prevention by O2-MB cavitation. Increased mechanical force on endothelium induced eNOS-activated vasodilation and angiogenesis to prevent re-occlusion at the I/R vessels. Local oxygen therapy increased endothelial oxygenation that inhibited HIF-1α expression, increased ATP generation, and activated cyclin D1 for cell repair. Moreover, a decrease in interstitial H2O2 level reduced the expression of caspase3, NFκB, TNFα, and IL6, thus ameliorating inflammatory responses. O2-MB cavitation showed efficacy in maintaining cardiac function and preventing myocardial fibrosis after I/R. Finally, we present a potential pathway for the modulation of endothelial metabolism by O2-MB cavitation in relation to I/R injury, wound healing, and vascular bioeffects.","['Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Mechanical force', 'Oxygen microbubble', 'Oxygen therapy', 'Ultrasound']",2022-02-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921493,Arbutin abrogates testicular ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats through repression of inflammation and ER stress.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of arbutin (ARB) administration on oxidative stress, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in an experimental testicular torsion/detorsion (T/D)-induced testicular injury model for the first time. A total of 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups with six rats in each group: sham control, T/D, T/D+ARB (50 mg/kg) and T/D+ARB (100 mg/kg). Torsion and detorsion times were applied as 4 h and 2 h, respectively. The levels of lipid peroxidation [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and oxidative stress [total oxidant status (TOS) and total antioxidant status (TAS)] in testicular tissues were determined using colorimetric methods. The levels of DNA damage [8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)], antioxidant system [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT)], pro-inflammatory cytokines [high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), nuclear factor kappa B protein 65 (NF-κB p65), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)], ER stress [78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)] and apoptosis (caspase-3) markers in testicular tissues were determined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Johnsen's testicle scoring system was used for histological evaluation. In the T/D group, it was determined that statistically significant increasing in the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, ER stress and apoptosis compared with sham control group (p < 0.05). ARB administrations statistically significantly restored testicular I/R damage in a dose dependent manner (p < 0.05). In addition, it was determined that the data of histological examinations supported the biochemical results. Our findings support the hypothesis that ARB may be used as a protective agent against T/D-induced testicular damage.","['Apoptosis', 'Arbutin', 'ER stress', 'Inflammation', 'Oxidative stress', 'Testicular torsion']",2022-10-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921491,Emodin alleviates testicular ischemia-reperfusion injury through the inhibition of NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of injury after testicular torsion and can lead to permanent impairment of spermatogenesis. Emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) has potent anti-inflammatory effects and may be protective against IRI in various organs. Herein, we evaluated the effects of emodin on pyroptosis in spermatogenic cells and its role in the process of testicular IRI. A testicular torsion/detorsion (TTD) mouse model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) germ cell model were established. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate the testicular ischemic injury. The expression of pyroptosis-related proteins and reactive oxygen species production in testis tissues were detected using Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase assay kits and immunohistochemistry. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were evaluated using Cell Counting Kit-8 and lactate dehydrogenase assay kit. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting were performed to assess inflammatory protein levels. The results revealed that pyroptosis and inflammation levels were upregulated after testicular IRI, and emodin inhibited inflammation and pyroptosis by acting on NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain-associated protein 3 (NLRP3). Emodin exerts protective effects on testicular IRI by acting on the NLRP3 signaling pathway and inhibiting IRI-mediated pyroptosis. Emodin treatment attenuated testicular IRI and inhibited pyroptosis. Inhibitory effects of emodin on pyroptosis were attributed to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Thus, emodin could be an alternative treatment for testicular IRI.","['Emodin', 'Ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'NLRP3', 'Pyroptosis', 'Testicular torsion']",2022-09-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921488,Gal-9/Tim-3 signaling pathway activation suppresses the generation of Th17 cells and promotes the induction of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"CD4+ T cells mediate the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Emerging research suggests that a Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) imbalance plays a pivotal role in the development of renal IRI. A recently identified negative checkpoint protein, T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain family 3 (Tim-3), inhibits the immune response by binding to its ligand, galectin-9 (Gal-9). However, the role of the Gal-9/Tim-3 signaling pathway in the regulation of CD4+ T cell subsets in renal IRI remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of the Gal-9/Tim-3 signaling pathway on Th17/Treg subsets in renal IRI using a mouse model. Renal IRI induced the expression of Gal-9 in renal tubular epithelial cells and increased the proportion of Tim-3+ Th17 cells and Tim-3+ forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)+ Treg cells in the ischemia-reperfusion (IR) kidneys. Administration of rAAV9-Gal-9 suppressed kidney inflammation, reduced the mortality of mice with renal IRI, increased Foxp3+ Treg cells, and reduced Th17 cells. In contrast, the blockade of Tim-3 in vivo using an anti-Tim-3 monoclonal antibody aggravated renal inflammation, decreased Foxp3+ Treg cells, and promoted Th17 cells. Thus, Gal-9/Tim-3 signaling pathway activation may protect against renal IRI by inhibiting Th17 cell production and inducing Foxp3+ Treg cell expansion. Our study suggests that the Gal-9/Tim-3 signaling pathway may be targeted by immunotherapy in renal IRI.","['Galectin-9', 'Regulatory T cell', 'Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3', 'Th17 cell']",2022-11-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36921265,"Incomplete Caspase 3 Activation and Mitigation of Apoptosis in Hibernating Ground Squirrels, Spermophilus lateralis.","AbstractHibernating golden-mantled ground squirrels, Spermophilus [Callospermophilus] lateralis, tolerate proapoptotic conditions, such as low body temperature, anorexia, acidosis, and ischemia/reperfusion. Avoiding widespread apoptosis is critical for hibernator survival. Caspase 3, the key executioner of apoptosis, cleaves a majority of apoptotic targets. Under proapoptotic conditions, inactive procaspase 3 (32 kDa) is activated when cleaved into 17- and 12-kDa fragments (p32, p17, and p12, respectively). Caspase 3 activation results in extreme enzymatic activation. Activity increases >10,000-fold followed by apoptotic execution. Is widespread apoptosis occurring during the proapoptotic hibernation season? Western blots showed p17 increased ∼2-fold during hibernation, indicating caspase 3 activation. However, in vitro caspase 3 activity assays found no extreme increases in activity. Downstream caspase 3 targets ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease) and PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) did not experience elevated cleavage during hibernation, which is inconsistent with caspase 3 activation. TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling) assays from multiple tissues found only 0.001%-0.009% of cells were TUNEL positive during winter, indicating negligible apoptosis during hibernation. Typically, caspase 3 activation generates a strong commitment toward apoptosis. We found that despite a ∼2-fold increase in active caspase 3, hibernators experience no downstream caspase 3 activity or widespread apoptosis. A systems-level approach suggests an incomplete signaling cascade wherein some caspase 3 activation during hibernation does not necessarily lead to bona fide apoptosis.","['DEVD-AMC', 'inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (ICAD)', 'p17 fragment', 'poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)', 'proapoptotic', 'terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL)']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36920684,Low-dose sumatriptan improves the outcome of acute mesenteric ischemia in rats via downregulating kynurenine.,"Mesenteric ischemia has remained without effective pharmacological management for many years. Sumatriptan, an abortive medication for migraine and cluster headaches, has potent anti-inflammatory properties and ameliorated organ ischemia in previous animal studies. Similarly, inhibition of the kynurenine pathway ameliorated renal and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in many preclinical studies. Herein, we assessed the effect of sumatriptan on experimental mesenteric I/R and investigated whether kynurenine pathway inhibition is a mechanism underlying its action.Ischemia was induced by ligating the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and its anastomosis with the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) with bulldog clamps for 30 min. Ischemia was followed by 1 h of reperfusion. Sumatriptan (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg ip) was injected 5 min before the reperfusion phase, 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT) (100 mg/kg iv) was used to inhibit kynurenine production. At the end of the reperfusion phase, samples were collected from the jejunum of rats for H&E staining and molecular assessments.Sumatriptan improved the integrity of intestinal mucosa after I/R, and 0.1 mg/kg was the most effective dose of sumatriptan in this study. Sumatriptan decreased the increased levels of TNF-α, kynurenine, and p-ERK but did not change the decreased levels of NO. Furthermore, sumatriptan significantly increased the decreased ratio of Bcl2/Bax. Similarly, 1-MT significantly decreased TNF-α and kynurenine and protected against mucosal damage.This study demonstrated that sumatriptan has protective effects against mesenteric ischemia and the kynurenine inhibition is potentially involved in this process. Therefore, it can be assumed that sumatriptan has the potential to be repurposed as a treatment for acute mesenteric ischemia.","['1-Methyltryptophan', 'Kynurenine', 'Mesenteric ischemia', 'Rats', 'Sumatriptan', 'TNF-α']",2022-11-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Detecting superoxide is crucial for understanding redox signaling but remains challenging. Herein, we introduce a class of activity-based sensing probes. The probes utilize 1,2,4,5-tetrazine as a superoxide-responsive trigger, which can be modularly tethered to various fluorophores to tune probe sensitivity and emission color. These probes afford ultra-specific and ultra-fluorogenic responses towards superoxide, and enable multiplexed imaging of various cellular superoxide levels in an organelle-resolved way. Notably, the probes reveal the aberrant superoxide generation in the pathology of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, and facilitate the establishment of a high-content screening pipeline for mediators of superoxide homeostasis. One such identified mediator, coprostanone, is shown to effectively ameliorating oxidative stress-induced injury in mice with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.

We aimed to determine risk factors, prevalence and outcomes associated with VA-ECMO-associated UGIB in adult patients.We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2014-2022) on consecutive VA-ECMO patients in the medical and infectious disease intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France. UGIB was defined as (i) an overt bleeding (haematemesis, melena, haematochezia) or (ii) acute anaemia associated with a lesion diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. VA-ECMO-associated UGIB was defined as an UGIB occurring during VA-ECMO, or up to 10 days after decannulation in patients weaned off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Cause-specific models were used to identify factors associated with UGIB and death, respectively.Among the 455 patients included, 48 (10%) were diagnosed with UGIB after a median of 12 [7; 23] days following ECMO cannulation. Mortality occurred in 36 (75%) patients with UGIB and 243 (60%) patients without. UGIB patients had longer intensive care unit stays (32 [19; 60] vs 18 [7; 37] days; P < 0.01), longer ECMO (14 [9; 18] vs 7 [4; 11] days; P < 0.01) and mechanical ventilation durations (21 [16; 36] vs 10 [5; 20] days; P < 0.01), as compared to non-UGIB patients. Ninety upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed, and the most frequent lesions detected were gastro-duodenal ulcers (n = 23, 26%), leading to 11/90 therapeutic procedures. By multivariable analysis, a history of peptic ulcer [cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) 2.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.01; 8.51]], a dual antiplatelet therapy (CSHR 2.0, 95% CI [1.07; 3.72]) and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CSHR 2.78, 95% CI [1.42; 5.45]) were independently associated with an increased risk of UGIB.In adult patients under VA-ECMO, a history of gastric ulcer, dual antiplatelet therapy and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation were independently associated with an increased risk of UGIB.

36916435,Beneficial effect of TLR4 blockade by a specific aptamer antagonist after acute myocardial infarction.,"Experimental evidence indicates that the control of the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction is a key strategy to reduce cardiac injury. Cellular damage after blood flow restoration in the heart promotes sterile inflammation through the release of molecules that activate pattern recognition receptors, among which TLR4 is the most prominent. Transient regulation of TLR4 activity has been considered one of the potential therapeutic interventions with greater projection towards the clinic. In this regard, the characterization of an aptamer (4FT) that acts as a selective antagonist for human TLR4 has been investigated in isolated macrophages from different species and in a rat model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The binding kinetics and biological responses of murine and human macrophages treated with 4FT show great affinity and significant inhibition of TLR4 signaling including the NF-κB pathway and the LPS-dependent increase in the plasma membrane currents (Kv currents). In the rat model of I/R, administration of 4FT following reoxygenation shows amelioration of cardiac injury function and markers, a process that is significantly enhanced when the second dose of 4FT is administered 24 h after reperfusion of the heart. Parameters such as cardiac injury biomarkers, infiltration of circulating inflammatory cells, and the expression of genes associated with the inflammatory onset are significantly reduced. In addition, the expression of anti-inflammatory genes, such as IL-10, and pro-resolution molecules, such as resolvin D1 are enhanced after 4FT administration. These results indicate that targeting TLR4 with 4FT offers new therapeutic opportunities to prevent cardiac dysfunction after infarction.","['ApTOLL', 'Aptamer', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Myocardial infarction', 'TLR4']",2022-10-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Gypenoside XVII groups were administered 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg (0.01 mL/g) gypenoside XVII by intragastric administration for 14 days; the other two groups received the same dose of saline. Rat cerebral I/R model was established by modified line bolt method; rats in the sham operated group underwent the same procedure without producing substantial embolization. After 24 hours of reperfusion, the neurological deficit scores of the rats in each group were assessed. Rat abdominal aortic whole blood was collected and the serum reactive oxygen species (ROS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (γ-GCS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), quinone NADH oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected.

36915987,Cyclophilin D-mediated Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Regulates Mitochondrial Function.,"Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles, which participate in biochemical processes. Mitochondria act as primary energy producers and biosynthetic centers of cells, which are involved in oxidative stress responses and cell signaling transduction. Among numerous potential mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction, the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is a major determinant of mitochondrial dysfunction to induce cellular damage or death. A plenty of studies have provided evidence that the abnormal opening of mPTP induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the impairment calcium homeostasis and the decrease of ATP production. Cyclophilin D (CypD), localized in the mitochondrial transition pore, is a mitochondrial chaperone that has been regarded as a prominent mediator of mPTP.This review describes the relationship between CypD, mPTP, and CypD-mPTP inhibitors through systematic investigation of recent relevant literature.Here, we have highlighted that inhibiting the activity of CypD protects models of some diseases, including ischaemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), neurodegenerative disorders and so on. Knockdown studies have demonstrated that CypD possibly is mediated by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity, while the primary targets of CypD remain obscure. The target of CypD-mPTP inhibitor can alleviate mPTP opening-induced cell death. The present review is focused on the role of CypD as a prominent mediator of the mPTP, further providing insight into the physiological function of mPTP and its regulation by CypD.Blocking the opening of mPTP by inhibiting CypD might be a new promising approach for suppressing cell death, which will suggest novel therapeutic approaches for mitochondria-related diseases.","['Mitochondria', 'cell death', 'cyclophilin D', 'mechanisms', 'mitochondrial permeability transition pore', 'reactive oxygen species']",2022-10-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36915981,Application of a novel artificial perfusate based on oxygen-carrying nanoparticles in normothermic machine perfusion for porcine liver preservation after cardiac death.,"To investigate the efficacy of a novel artificial perfusate based on oxygen-carrying perfluoronaphthalene-albumin nanoparticles in normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) for preservation of porcine liver donation after cardiac death.Artificial perfusate with perfluoronaphthalene-albumin nanoparticles was prepared at 5% albumin (w/v) and its oxygen carrying capacity was calculated. The livers of 16 Landrace pigs were isolated after 1 h of warm ischemia, and then they were divided into 4 groups and preserved continuously for 24 h with different preservation methods: cold preservation with UW solution (SCS group), NMP preservation by whole blood (blood NMP group), NMP preservation by artificial perfusate without nanoparticles (non-nanoparticles NMP group) and NMP preservation by artificial perfusate containing nanoparticles (nanoparticles NMP group). Hemodynamics, tissue metabolism, biochemical indices of perfusate and bile were monitored every 4 h after the beginning of NMP. Liver tissue samples were collected for histological examination (HE and TUNEL staining) before preservation, 12 h and 24 h after preservation.The oxygen carrying capacity of nanoparticles in 100 mL artificial perfusate was 6.94 μL/mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa). The hepatic artery and portal vein resistance of nanoparticles NMP group and blood NMP group remained stable during perfusion, and the vascular resistance of nanoparticles NMP group was lower than that of blood NMP group. The concentration of lactic acid in the perfusate decreased to the normal range within 8 h in both nanoparticles NMP group and blood NMP group. There were no significant differences in accumulated bile production, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in perfusate between nanoparticles NMP group and blood NMP group (all P>0.05). After 24 h perfusion, the histological Suzuki score in blood NMP group and nanoparticles NMP group was lower than that in SCS group and non-nanoparticles NMP group (all P<0.05), and the quantities of TUNEL staining positive cells in blood NMP group and non-nanoparticles NMP group was higher than those in nanoparticles NMP group and SCS group 12 h and 24 h after preservation (all P<0.05).Artificial perfusate based on oxygen-carrying nanoparticles can meet the oxygen supply requirements of porcine livers donation after cardiac death during NMP preservation, and it may has superiorities in improving tissue microcirculation and alleviating ischemia-reperfusion injury.","['Artificial perfusate', 'Donor livers after cardiac death', 'Ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'Normothermic machine perfusion', 'Oxygen-carrying nanoparticles']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36915795,Effects of polydatin from Huhuang Shaoshang Liniment on oxidative damage and inflammatory response in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.,"To analyze the effect of polydatin (PD) from Huhuang Shaoshang Liniment on oxidative damage and inflammatory response in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI/R), and the effect of PD on NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) pathway.The rat model of focal CI/R was established using suture-occlusion method and treated with intraperitoneal injection of PD (25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine the PD content in three batches of Huhuang Shaoshang Liniment. The neurological function scores of each group were observed at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperatively. The hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was conducted to observe the morphological structure of brain tissue, the triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to determine the size of cerebral infarction, and the neuronal apoptotic index was calculated using image analysis system under the optical microscope. The expressions of the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway and neuronal apoptosis-related proteins in brain tissue were measured using Western blot.The PD content in three batches of Huhuang Shaoshang Liniment was detected by HPLC, and the average result showed that the product contained 0.73 mg PD per 1 mL. The PD 50 mg/kg group and 25 mg/kg group showed lower neurological function scores at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h postoperatively, lower percentage of cerebral infarction area on the ischemic side and apoptotic index, lower interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, malondialdehyde (MDA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and lower Bax protein expression (P < 0.05), and showed higher IL-4, IL-10, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, and c-Myc protein expression than the CI/R group (P < 0.05).PD from Huhuang Shaoshang Liniment can alleviate neurological damage, improve neuronal morphology and structure, reduce cerebral infarction area, alleviate oxidative damage and inflammatory response, and inhibit neuronal cell apoptosis in CI/R model rats.","['Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway', 'inflammatory response', 'oxidative damage', 'polydatin']",2022-04-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36915024,Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Protects Vascular Grafts of Brain-Dead Rats Against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,"Endothelial dysfunction is a potential side effect of brain death (BD). Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury during heart transplantation may lead to further endothelial damage. Protective effects of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), a human neutrophil serine protease inhibitor, have been demonstrated against IR injury. We hypothesized that AAT protects brain-dead rats' vascular grafts from IR injury.Donor rats were subjected to BD by inflation of a subdural balloon. After 5.5 h, aortic rings were immediately mounted in organ baths (BD, n = 6 rats) or preserved in saline, supplemented either with vehicle (BD-IR, n = 8 rats) or AAT (BD-IR + AAT, n = 14 rats) for 24 h. During organ bath experiment, rings from both IR groups were exposed to hypochlorite to simulate warm reperfusion-associated endothelial injury. Endothelial function was measured ex vivo. Immunohistochemical staining for caspases was carried out and DNA-strand breaks were evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. Data are presented as median (interquartile range).AAT improved IR-induced decreased maximum endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation to acetylcholine in the BD-IR + AAT aortas compared to the BD-IR group (BD: 83 (9-28) % versus BD-IR: 49 (39-60) % versus BD-IR + AAT: 64 (24-42) %, P < 0.05). Additionally, an increase in the rings' sensitivity to acetylcholine was noted after AAT (pD2-value: BD-IR + AAT: 7.35 (7.06-7.89) versus BD-IR: 6.96 (6.65-7.21), P < 0.05). Caspase-3, -8, -9, and -12 immunoreactivity and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells were significantly decreased by AAT.AAT alleviates endothelial dysfunction, prevents increased caspase-3, -8, -9, and -12 levels, and decreases apoptotic DNA breakage due to BD and IR injury. This suggests that AAT treatment may be therapeutically beneficial to reduce IR-induced vascular damage.","['Alpha-1-antitrypsin', 'Brain death', 'Endothelial function', 'Heart transplantation', 'Ischemia/reperfusion']",2021-11-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36914994,Effect of Butylphthalide Capsules on Smac and XIAP Expression in Rats after Ischemia Reperfusion.,"Little is known about the protective effects of butylphthalide on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. This study aims to investigate the impact on the second mitochondrial-derived activator of Caspases (Smac) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression in the ischemic semidark area using a rat model of carotid artery stenosis.Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the sham-operated group, carotid stenosis model controls, low-dose (20 mg/kg), medium-dose (40 mg/kg), and high-dose (80 mg/kg) butylphthalide groups. The neurological function was scored by the balance beam test (BBT). The morphological changes of brain tissue were detected by Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, with apoptosis detected by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. Smac and XIAP protein expression were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expressions of Smac and XIAP mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).HE showed that neuronal loss, nuclear consolidation, and vacuolar degeneration were significantly reduced in the medium and high-dose butylphthalide groups compared with the model controls. The BBT scores and apoptotic index were significantly lower in the medium and high doses of butylphthalide compared with the model controls. RT-qPCR and IHC showed that Smac, XIAP mRNA and protein expressions in the ischemic hemispheric region were significantly reduced in low, medium, and high doses of butylphthalide compared with the model controls (P < 0.05), showing some concentration effect.Butylphthalide can significantly reduce Smac and XIAP mRNA and protein expression, inhibit neuronal apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats with carotid stenosis, and exert neuroprotective effects.","['Butylphthalide', 'Carotid stenosis', 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'Smac', 'X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein']",2022-01-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36914909,NAD+ precursor supplementation prevents mtRNA/RIG-I-dependent inflammation during kidney injury.,"Our understanding of how global changes in cellular metabolism contribute to human kidney disease remains incompletely understood. Here we show that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deficiency drives mitochondrial dysfunction causing inflammation and kidney disease development. Using unbiased global metabolomics in healthy and diseased human kidneys, we identify NAD+ deficiency as a disease signature. Furthermore using models of cisplatin- or ischaemia-reperfusion induced kidney injury in male mice we observed NAD+ depletion Supplemental nicotinamide riboside or nicotinamide mononucleotide restores NAD+ levels and improved kidney function. We find that cisplatin exposure causes cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) and activation of the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), both of which can be ameliorated by restoring NAD+. Male mice with RIG-I knock-out (KO) are protected from cisplatin-induced kidney disease. In summary, we demonstrate that the cytosolic release of mtRNA and RIG-I activation is an NAD+-sensitive mechanism contributing to kidney disease.",[],2022-07-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36914282,Unveiling the Mechanism of Alleviating Ischemia Reperfusion Injury via a Layered Double Hydroxide-Based Nanozyme.,"Oxidative stress after ischemia reperfusion can cause irreversible brain damage. Thus, it is vital to timely consume excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and conduct molecular imaging monitoring on the brain injury site. However, previous studies have focused on how to scavenge ROS while ignoring the mechanism of relieving the reperfusion injury. Herein, we reported a layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based nanozyme (denoted as ALDzyme), which was fabricated by the confinement of astaxanthin (AST) with LDH. This ALDzyme can mimic natural enzymes, which include superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, the SOD-like activity of ALDzyme is 16.3 times higher than that of CeO2 (a typical ROS scavenger). Based on these enzyme-mimicking properties, this one-of-a-kind ALDzyme offers strong anti-oxidative properties as well as high biocompatibility. Importantly, this unique ALDzyme can establish an efficient magnetic resonance imaging platform, thus guiding the in vivo details. As a result, the infarct area can be reduced by 77% after reperfusion therapy, and the neurological impairment score can be lowered from 3-4 to 0-1. Density functional theory computations can reveal more about the mechanism of this ALDzyme's significant ROS consumption. These findings provide a method for unraveling the neuroprotection application process in ischemia reperfusion injury using an LDH-based nanozyme as a remedial nanoplatform.","['ALDzyme', 'DFT calculation', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'mechanism', 'oxidative stress', 'stroke']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36914214,Tubulovascular protection from protease-activated receptor-1 depletion during AKI-to-CKD transition.,"Thromboembolic events are prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients due to increased thrombin generation leading to a hypercoagulable state. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) by vorapaxar reduces kidney fibrosis.We used an animal model of unilateral ischemia-reperfusion (UIRI)-induced CKD to explore the tubulovascular crosstalk mechanisms of PAR-1 in AKI-to-CKD transition.During the early phase of AKI, PAR-1 deficient mice exhibited reduced kidney inflammation, vascular injury and preserved endothelial integrity and capillary permeability. During the transition phase to CKD, PAR-1 deficiency preserved kidney function and diminished tubulointerstitial fibrosis via downregulated TGF-β/Smad signaling. Maladaptive repair in the microvasculature after AKI further exacerbated focal hypoxia with capillary rarefaction, which was rescued by stabilization of HIF and increased tubular VEGFA in PAR-1 deficient mice. Chronic inflammation was also prevented with reduced kidney infiltration by both M1- and M2- polarized macrophages. In thrombin-induced human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs), PAR-1 mediated vascular injury through activation of NFκB and ERK MAPK pathways. Gene silencing of PAR-1 exerted microvascular protection via a tubulovascular crosstalk mechanism during hypoxia in HDMECs. Finally, pharmacologic blockade of PAR-1 with vorapaxar improved kidney morphology, promoted vascular regenerative capacity, and reduced inflammation and fibrosis depending on the time of initiation.Our findings elucidate a detrimental role of PAR-1 in vascular dysfunction and profibrotic responses upon tissue injury during AKI-to-CKD transition and provide an attractive therapeutic strategy for post-injury repair in AKI.","['AKI-to-CKD transition', 'HIF stabilization', 'PAR-1', 'tubulointerstitial fibrosis', 'vorapaxar']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36914061,Ginsenoside Rg1 attenuates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through inhibiting the inflammatory activation of microglia.,"It is recognized that the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury triggers inflammatory activation of microglia and supports microglia-driven neuronal damage. Our previous studies have shown that ginsenoside Rg1 had a significant protective effect on focal cerebral I/R injury in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. However, the mechanism still needs further clarification. Here, we firstly reported that ginsenoside Rg1 effectively suppressed the inflammatory activation of brain microglia cells under I/R conditions depending on the inhibition of Toll-likereceptor4 (TLR4) proteins. In vivo experiments showed that the ginsenoside Rg1 administration could significantly improve the cognitive function of MCAO rats, and in vitro experimental data showed that ginsenoside Rg1 significantly alleviated neuronal damage via inhibiting the inflammatory response in microglia cells co-cultured under oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) condition in gradient dependent. The mechanism study showed that the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 depends on the suppression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and TLR4/TRIF/IRF-3 pathways in microglia cells. In a word, our research shows that ginsenoside Rg1 has great application potential in attenuating the cerebral I/R injury by targeting TLR4 protein in the microglia cells.","['Ginsenoside Rg1', 'Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)', 'Microglia', 'Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)', 'Oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)', 'TLR4']",2022-09-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36913720,siRNA Delivery against Myocardial Ischemia Reperfusion Injury Mediated by Reversibly Camouflaged Biomimetic Nanocomplexes.,"siRNA-mediated management of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is greatly hampered by the inefficient myocardial enrichment and cardiomyocyte transfection. Herein, nanocomplexes (NCs) reversibly camouflaged with a platelet-macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) are developed to efficiently deliver Sav1 siRNA (siSav1) into cardiomyocytes, suppressing the Hippo pathway and inducing cardiomyocyte regeneration. The biomimetic BSPC@HM NCs consist of a cationic nanocore assembled from a membrane-penetrating helical polypeptide (P-Ben) and siSav1, a charge-reversal intermediate layer of poly(l-lysine)-cis-aconitic acid (PC), and an outer shell of HM. Due to HM-mediated inflammation homing and microthrombus targeting, intravenously injected BSPC@HM NCs can efficiently accumulate in the IR-injured myocardium, where the acidic inflammatory microenvironment triggers charge reversal of PC to shed off both HM and PC layers and allow the penetration of the exposed P-Ben/siSav1 NCs into cardiomyocytes. In rats and pigs, BSPC@HM NCs remarkably downregulates Sav1 in IR-injured myocardium, promotes myocardium regeneration, suppresses myocardial apoptosis, and recovers cardiac functions. This study reports a bioinspired strategy to overcome the multiple systemic barriers against myocardial siRNA delivery, and holds profound potential for gene therapy against cardiac injuries.","['cardiomyocyte regeneration', 'charge reversal', 'hybrid cell-membrane coatings', 'myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury', 'siRNA delivery']",2022-11-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36913265,Impacts of ischemic preconditioning in liver resection: systematic review with meta-analysis.,"To assess the beneficial effects of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) in liver resection and evaluate its applicability in clinical practice.Liver surgeries are usually associated with intentional transient ischemia for hemostatic control. IPC is a surgical step that intends to reduce the effects of ischemia/reperfusion; however, there is no strong evidence about the real impact of the IPC, and it is necessary to effectively clarify what its effects are.Randomized clinical trials were selected comparing IPC with no preconditioning in patients undergoing liver resection. Data were extracted by three independent researchers according to the PRISMA guidelines, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JS9/A79. Several outcomes were evaluated, including postoperative peaks of transaminases and bilirubin, mortality, length of hospital stay, length of stay in the ICU, bleeding, transfusion of blood products, among others. Bias risks were assessed using the Cochrane collaboration tool.17 articles were selected, with a total of 1,052 patients. IPC did not change the surgical time of the liver resections while these patients bled less (MD: -49.97 mL, 95% CI, -86.32 to -13.6, I²: 64%), needed less blood products (RR: 0.71, 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; I²=0%), and had a lower risk of postoperative ascites (RR 0.40, 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.93; I²=0%). The other outcomes had no statistical differences or could not have their meta-analyses conducted due to high heterogeneity.IPC is applicable in clinical practice and it has some beneficial effect.

36913179,Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells secrete extracellular vesicles: A potential cell-free therapy for canine renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury.,"Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a promising source of therapies for ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) because of their potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.The aims of this study were to explore the therapeutic efficacy and potential mechanism of ADMSC-EVs in canine renal IR injury.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and EVs were isolated and characterised for surface markers. A canine IR model administered with ADMSC-EVs was used to evaluate therapeutic effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis.CD105, CD90 and beta integrin ITGB were positively expressed in MSCs, while CD63, CD9 and intramembrane marker TSG101 were positively expressed in EVs. Compared with the IR model group, there was less mitochondrial damage and reduction in quantity of mitochondria in the EV treatment group. Renal IR injury led to severe histopathological lesions and significant increases in biomarkers of renal function, inflammation and apoptosis, which were attenuated by the administration of ADMSC-EVs.Secretion of EVs by ADMSCs exhibited therapeutic potential in renal IR injury and may lead to a cell-free therapy for canine renal IR injury. These findings revealed that canine ADMSC-EVs potently attenuate renal IR injury-induced renal dysfunction, inflammation and apoptosis, possibly by reducing mitochondrial damage.","['apoptosis', 'extracellular vesicles', 'ischaemia-reperfusion', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'mitochondrial damage']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify relevant comparative studies up to January 2023. This study was conducted with the Review Manager 5.4 software, and included RAPN and OPN-controlled trials for complex renal tumors. The prime outcomes were to assess the perioperative results, complications, renal function, and oncologic outcomes. A total of 1493 patients were included in seven studies. Compared to OPN, RAPN was associated with a significantly shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD] - 1.53 days, 95% confidence interval [CI] - 2.44, - 0.62; p = 0.001), less blood loss (WMD - 95.88 mL, 95% CI - 144.19, - 47.56; p = 0.0001), lower transfusion rates (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15, 0.71; p = 0.005), fewer major complications (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.39, 1.01; p = 0.05), and fewer overall complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36, 0.65; p < 0.00001). Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups in operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated glomerular decline, intraoperative complications, positive surgical margins, local recurrence, overall survival, and recurrence-free survival.

Methods: This retrospective observational study investigates all encounters conducted for acute visual loss between 2010 and 2021 in our multicentric Mayo Clinic Telestroke Network. Demographics, time from visual loss to telestroke evaluation, ocular examination, diagnostic, and therapeutic recommendations were collected for CRAO subjects. Results: Out of 9,511, 49 encounters (0.51%) were conducted for an acute ocular complaint. Five patients had possible CRAO, and 4 presented within 4.5 h from symptom onset (range 1.5-5 h). None received thrombolytic therapy. All telestroke physicians recommended ophthalmology consultation. Conclusion: Current telestroke assessment of acute visual loss is suboptimal and patients eligible for acute reperfusion therapies may not be offered treatment. Teleophthalmologic evaluations and advanced ophthalmic diagnostic tools should complement telestroke systems.","['retinal ischemia', 'stroke', 'teleophthalmology', 'telestroke']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36912143,Resveratrol Preconditioning Mitigates Ischemia-Induced Septal Cholinergic Cell Loss and Memory Impairments.,"Cholinergic cells originating from the nuclei of the basal forebrain (BF) are critical for supporting various memory processes, yet BF cholinergic cell viability has not been explored in the context of focal cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we examined cell survival within several BF nuclei in rodents following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. We tested the hypothesis that a previously established neuroprotective therapy-resveratrol preconditioning-would rescue BF cell loss, deficits in cholinergic-related memory performance, and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction after focal cerebral ischemia.Adult (2-3-month old) male Sprague-Dawley rats or wild-type C57Bl/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of resveratrol or vehicle and subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion using the intraluminal suture method 2 days later. Histopathological, behavioral, and electrophysiological outcomes were measured 1-week post-reperfusion. Animals with reduction in cerebral blood flow <30% of baseline were excluded.Cholinergic cell loss was observed in the medial septal nucleus and diagonal band of Broca following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. This effect was prevented by resveratrol preconditioning, which also ameliorated transient middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced deficits in cognitive performance and hippocampal long-term potentiation.We demonstrate for the first time that focal cerebral ischemia induces cholinergic cell death within memory-relevant nuclei of the BF. The preservation of cholinergic cell viability may provide a mechanism by which resveratrol preconditioning improves memory performance and preserves functionality of memory-processing brain structures after focal cerebral ischemia.","['basal forebrain', 'cell survival', 'cognition', 'ischemia', 'resveratrol']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36912141,Prognostic Value of Thrombus Volume and Interaction With First-Line Endovascular Treatment Device Choice.,"A larger thrombus in patients with acute ischemic stroke might result in more complex endovascular treatment procedures, resulting in poorer patient outcomes. Current evidence on thrombus volume and length related to procedural and functional outcomes remains contradicting. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of thrombus volume and thrombus length and whether this relationship differs between first-line stent retrievers and aspiration devices for endovascular treatment.In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, 670 of 3279 patients from the MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) for endovascularly treated large vessel occlusions were included. Thrombus volume (0.1 mL) and length (0.1 mm) based on manual segmentations and measurements were related to reperfusion grade (expanded Treatment in Cerebral Infarction score) after endovascular treatment, the number of retrieval attempts, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and a shift for functional outcome at 90 days measured with the reverted ordinal modified Rankin Scale (odds ratio >1 implies a favorable outcome). Univariable and multivariable linear and logistic regression were used to report common odds ratios (cORs)/adjusted cOR and regression coefficients (B/aB) with 95% CIs. Furthermore, a multiplicative interaction term was used to analyze the relationship between first-line device choice, stent retrievers versus aspiration device, thrombus volume, and outcomes.Thrombus volume was associated with functional outcome (adjusted cOR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71-0.97]) and number of retrieval attempts (aB, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.16-0.28]) but not with the other outcome measures. Thrombus length was only associated with functional independence (adjusted cOR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24-0.85]). Patients with more voluminous thrombi had worse functional outcomes if endovascular treatment was based on first-line stent retrievers (interaction cOR, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.50-0.89]; P=0.005; adjusted cOR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-1.0]; P=0.04).In this study, patients with a more voluminous thrombus required more endovascular thrombus retrieval attempts and had a worse functional outcome. Patients with a lengthier thrombus were less likely to achieve functional independence at 90 days. For more voluminous thrombi, first-line stent retrieval compared with first-line aspiration might be associated with worse functional outcome.","['functional status', 'ischemic stroke', 'prognosis', 'stents', 'thrombosis']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36911386,Icariin protects cerebral neural cells from ischemia‑reperfusion injury in an in vitro model by lowering ROS production and intracellular calcium concentration.,"Ischemia is one of the major causes of stroke. The present study investigated the protection of cultured neural cells by icariin (ICA) against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and possible mechanisms underlying the protection. Neural cells were isolated from neonatal rats and cultured in vitro. The cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD-R) as an I/R mimic to generate I/R injury, and were post-OGD-R treated with ICA. Following the treatments, cell viability, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Ca2+ concentration were assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, flow cytometry, CyQUANT™ LDH Cytotoxicity Assay, H2DCFDA and SOD colorimetric activity kit. After OGD-R, considerable I/R injury was observed in the neural cells, as indicated by reduced cell viability, increased apoptosis and increased production of ROS and LDH (P<0.05). Cellular Ca2+ concentration was also increased, while SOD activity remained unchanged. Post-OGD-R ICA treatments increased cell viability up to 87.1% (P<0.05) and reduced apoptosis as low as 6.6% (P<0.05) in a concentration-dependent manner. The treatments also resulted in fewer ROS (P<0.05), lower extracellular LDH content (440.5 vs. 230.3 U/l; P<0.05) and reduced Ca2+ increase (P<0.05). These data suggest that ICA protects the neural cells from I/R injury in an in vitro model through antioxidation activity and maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. This function may be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for ischemia-related diseases after further in vivo studies.","['Ca2+ homeostasis', 'antioxidant', 'ischemia', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'neuroprotection', 'reactive oxygen species']",2022-10-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36911381,Scutellarin ameliorates ischemia/reperfusion injury‑induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction via inhibition of the cGAS‑STING pathway.,"Ischemic heart disease is a common cardiovascular disease. Scutellarin (SCU) exhibits protective effects in ischemic cardiomyocytes; however, to the best of our knowledge, the protective mechanism of SCU remains unclear. The present study was performed to investigate the protective effect of SCU on cardiomyocytes after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the underlying mechanism. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with SCU (20 mg/kg) for 7 days before establishing the heart I/R injury model. Cardiac function was detected using small animal echocardiography, apoptotic cells were visualized using TUNEL staining, the myocardial infarct area was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, and the protein levels of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), stimulator of interferon genes (STING), Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 were detected by western blotting. In in vitro experiments, H9c2 cells were pretreated with SCU, RU.521 (cGAS inhibitor) and H-151 (STING inhibitor), before cell hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury. The viability of H9c2 cells was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, the rate of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry, and the protein expression levels of cGAS, STING, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved Caspase-3 were detected by western blotting. It was revealed that SCU ameliorated cardiac dysfunction and apoptosis, and inhibited the activation of the cGAS-STING and Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase-3 signaling pathways in I/R-injured mice. It was also observed that SCU significantly increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis in H/R-induced H9c2 cells. Furthermore, H/R increased the expression levels of cGAS, STING and cleaved Caspase-3, and decreased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, which could be reversed by treatment with SCU, RU.521 and H-151. The present study demonstrated that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of the activation of the Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase-3 signaling pathway to mediate I/R-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction, which could be ameliorated by SCU treatment.","['apoptosis', 'cyclic GMP-AMP synthase', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'scutellarin', 'stimulator of interferon genes']",2022-06-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36911371,Tranilast reduces cardiomyocyte injury induced by ischemia‑reperfusion via Nrf2/HO‑1/NF‑κB signaling.,"Tranilast, a synthetic derivative of a tryptophan metabolite, can be used to treat heart diseases. However, the specific mechanism underlying the effect of tranilast on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine if tranilast could attenuate I/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury. A hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model of H9c2 cardiomyocytes was established to simulate I/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury. The viability, apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress in H/R-induced H9c2 cells following treatment with tranilast were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 and TUNEL assay. Commercially available kits were used to detect the levels of inflammatory markers and oxidative stress indicators. In addition, the expression levels of the apoptosis- and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)/NF-κB signalling pathway-associated proteins were detected by western blotting. The levels of reactive oxygen species were determined using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay kit. The viability of H9c2 cells was decreased following induction with H/R. However, treatment with tranilast increased viability while decreasing apoptosis, oxidative stress and inflammatory response in H/R-induced H9c2 cells by activating Nrf2/HO-1/NF-κB signalling. Furthermore, treatment with ML-385, an Nrf2 inhibitor, reversed the effects of tranilast on H/R-induced H9c2 cells. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that tranilast could attenuate I/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury via the Nrf2/HO-1/NF-κB signalling pathway.","['apoptosis', 'cardiomyocyte injury', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase-1/NF-κB signaling', 'tranilast']",2022-03-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The aim of this study was to explore the role of HIF-1α/BNIP3 in the alleviating effect of IL-4 on CIRI in mice.Mice were randomly divided into sham operation (Sham), ischemia reperfusion (IR), IL-4, HIF-1α inhibitor 2ME2 and IL-4+2ME2 groups. Middle cerebral artery occlusion model was established. After 24-h reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS) was given. Cerebral infarction volume and brain water content were measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and dry-wet weights, respectively. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. SOD, MDA and ROS levels, and HIF-1α, BNIP3, LC3II and Beclin-1 expressions were detected through colorimetry and Western blotting, respectively.Compared with IR group, NDS, cerebral infarction volume, brain water content, apoptosis rate, and MDA and ROS levels decreased, while SOD, HIF-1α, BNIP3, LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels increased in IL-4 group (P<0.05). 2ME2 and IL-4+2ME2 groups had decreased NDS, cerebral infarction volume, brain water content, apoptosis rate and MDA, ROS, HIF-1α, BNIP3, LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels, but increased SOD level compared with those of IL-4 group (P<0.05).IL-4 reduces apoptosis and oxidative stress through activating the HIF-1α/BNIP3 pathway, thereby alleviating mouse CIRI.","['Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa interacting protein 3', 'Hypoxia inducible factor 1α', 'cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury', 'interleukin-4']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36910297,A Novel Technique of SMA Massage with Systemic Fibrinolytic Therapy in Ischemic Midgut Volvulus: As a Lifesaving Last Expedient.,"Midgut volvulus is a surgical emergency requiring immediate intervention. Intestinal ischemia of the midgut as a consequence of volvulus from malrotation is a fateful event with high mortality and significant morbidity even in survivors. Derotation followed by correction of malrotation is the procedure of choice though has significant morbidity if intestinal reperfusion was not successful. A combined treatment to restore intestinal perfusion based on the digital massage of the superior mesenteric artery after derotation and systemic infusion of fibrinolytic has been previously reported with success but underused. Here, we report three such cases of midgut malrotation with severe intestinal ischemia due to volvulus.A retrospective analysis of three confirmed cases of midgut malrotation with volvulus managed with emergency laparotomy, derotation, and Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA) massage with systemic fibrinolytic therapy, followed by correction of malrotation was evaluated.There was dramatic improvement in intestinal perfusion noted in all three patients inspite of delayed presentation. 2 out of 3 patients on follow up are doing well with adequate weight gain while 1 patient succumbed due to sepsis.Critical intestinal ischemia due to mesenteric thrombosis can persist after derotation of midgut volvulus and can lead to devastating consequences. The use of digital massage of SMA to disrupt the thrombus along with fibrinolytic therapy though reported is underutilized. Hence, awareness of this management and usage needs to be re-emphasized.","['Fibrinolytic therapy', 'SMA massage', 'intestinal ischemia', 'malrotation', 'midgut volvulus']",2022-05-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36909944,Neuroprotective effect of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide against ischemia-reperfusion injury is mediated by ferroptosis regulation via the SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 pathway and the attenuation of blood-brain barrier disruption.,"Stroke is one of the most severe diseases worldwide, resulting in physical and mental problems. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide, a compound derived from celery seed, has been approved for treating ischemic stroke in China. No study has evaluated how Dl-3-n-butylphthalide affects the ferroptosis SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 signal pathway and blood-brain barrier (BBB) PDGFRβ/PI3K/Akt signal pathways in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model of ischemic stroke.Sprague-Dawley rats were used to develop the MCAO/R model. Our study used three incremental doses (10, 20, and 30) of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide injected intraperitoneally 24 h after MCAO/R surgery. The neuroprotective effect and success of the model were evaluated using the neurofunction score, brain water content determination, and triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride-determined infarction area changes. Pathological changes in the brain tissue and the degree of apoptosis were examined by hematoxylin and eosin, Nissl, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining. In addition, pathway proteins and RNA expression levels were studied to verify the effects of Dl-3-n-butyphthalide on both pathways. At the same time, commercial kits were used to detect glutathione, reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde, to detect oxidative stress in brain tissues.The middle dose of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide not only improved MCAO-induced brain dysfunction and alleviated pathological damage, brain inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis but also protected against ferroptosis and reduced BBB damage. These changes resulted in improved neurological function in the cerebral cortex.We speculate that Dl-3-n-butylphthalide has a neuroprotective effect on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, which may be mediated through ferroptosis-dependent SLC7A11/GSH/GPX4 signal pathway and PDGFRβ/PI3/Akt signal pathway.","['N-butylphthalide', 'blood–brain barrier', 'ferroptosis', 'ischemic/reperfusion', 'neuroinflammation']",2022-08-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

In an effort to study phenomena related strictly to ischemia reperfusion and donor preservation protocols, it is essential to avoid the immune responses related to allotransplantation. Orthotopic auto-transplantation is a unique strategy to the field of cardiac transplantation for ex vivo experimentation. Nevertheless, auto-transplantation carries its own technical challenges related to insufficient length of the great vessels that are to be transected and re-anastomosed.A novel method for orthotopic cardiac auto-transplantation in the porcine model was developed and was described herein. Porcine models were used for ex vivo experimentation of a novel device to study ischemia reperfusion injury.A total of five porcine models were used for ex vivo experimentation of a novel device to mitigate ischemia reperfusion injury and determine effects of donor preservation. Modifications to routine cardiac transplantation protocols to allow for successful auto-transplantation are described.Orthotopic cardiac auto-transplantation in the porcine model is a plausible and technically feasible method for reliable study of ischemia reperfusion injury and donor preservation protocols. Here, we describe methods for both direct orthotopic porcine cardiac auto-transplantations as well as a simplified protocol that can be substituted for full surgical auto-transplantation for the studies of preservation of donor hearts.","['Cardiac Surgery', 'Cardiac Transplantation', 'Porcine']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36909244,The potential roles of galectin-3 in AKI and CKD.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition with high morbidity and mortality, and is associated with the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The beta-galactoside binding protein galectin-3 (Gal3), with its proinflammatory and profibrotic properties, has been implicated in the development of both AKI and CKD. Serum Gal3 levels are elevated in patients with AKI and CKD, and elevated Gal3 is associated with progression of CKD. In addition, Gal3 is associated with the incidence of AKI among critically ill patients, and blocking Gal3 in murine models of sepsis and ischemia-reperfusion injury results in significantly lower AKI incidence and mortality. Here we review the role of Gal3 in the pathophysiology of AKI and CKD, as well as the therapeutic potential of targeting Gal3.","['acute kidney injury', 'chronic kidney disease', 'galectin-3', 'inflammation', 'renal fibrosis']",2022-11-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36909178,Effect of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide on mitochondrial Cox7c in models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Several studies have demonstrated the protective effect of dl-3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP) against cerebral ischemia, which may be related to the attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the specific mechanism and targets of NBP in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion remains unclear. In this study, we used a chemical proteomics approach to search for targets of NBP and identified cytochrome C oxidase 7c (Cox7c) as a key interacting target of NBP. Our findings indicated that NBP inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release and increases ATP production through upregulation of Cox7c. Subsequently, mitochondrial respiratory capacity was improved and the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway was upregulated, which contributed to the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential and blood brain barrier integrity and promoting angiogenesis. Therefore, our findings provided a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of NBP, and also proposed for the first time that Cox7c exerts a critical role by protecting mitochondrial function.","['Dl-3-n-butylphthalide', 'ROS', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'mitochondrial dysfunction']",2022-10-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36908855,Celastrol targeting Nedd4 reduces Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress in astrocytes after ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, and oxidative stress plays a crucial role. Celastrol exhibits strong antioxidant properties in several diseases; however, whether it can affect oxidation in cerebral ischemic-reperfusion injury (CIRI) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether celastrol could reduce oxidative damage during CIRI and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Here, we found that celastrol attenuated oxidative injury in CIRI by upregulating nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Using alkynyl-tagged celastrol and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that celastrol directly bound to neuronally expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (Nedd4) and then released Nrf2 from Nedd4 in astrocytes. Nedd4 promoted the degradation of Nrf2 through K48-linked ubiquitination and thus contributed to astrocytic reactive oxygen species production in CIRI, which was significantly blocked by celastrol. Furthermore, by inhibiting oxidative stress and astrocyte activation, celastrol effectively rescued neurons from axon damage and apoptosis. Our study uncovered Nedd4 as a direct target of celastrol, and that celastrol exerts an antioxidative effect on astrocytes by inhibiting the interaction between Nedd4 and Nrf2 and reducing Nrf2 degradation in CIRI.","['Celastrol', 'Cerebral ischemia', 'Nedd4', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reperfusion injury', 'Ubiquitylation']",2022-06-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36908508,Hypoxia signaling in the equine small intestine: Expression and distribution of hypoxia inducible factors during experimental ischemia.,"Hypoxia inducible factors (HIF) are widely researched in human medicine for their role in different disease processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and distribution of HIF in experimental small intestinal ischemia in the horse.In 14 horses under general anesthesia, segmental jejunal ischemia with 90% reduction in blood flow was induced. The horses were randomly divided into two groups of seven horses, one subjected to ischemic postconditioning (IPoC) by delayed reperfusion, and a control group (group C) undergoing undelayed reperfusion. Intestinal samples were taken pre-ischemia, after ischemia and after reperfusion. Following immunohistochemical staining for HIF1α and -2α, the immunoreactivity pattern in the small intestine was evaluated by light microscopy, and the mucosal enterocyte and muscularis staining were semi-quantitatively scored. Additionally, mucosal HIF1α protein levels were determined by an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and mRNA levels of HIF1α and its target genes by a two-step real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction. Statistical comparison was performed between the groups and time points using parametric and non-parametric tests (p < 0.05).All cell types exhibited cytoplasmic and nuclear immunoreactivity for HIF1α. After reperfusion, the cytoplasmic staining of the crypt and villus enterocytes as well as the villus nuclear staining significantly increased, whereas the perinuclear granules in the crypts decreased. The protein levels showed a significant decrease in group C at reperfusion, with lower HIF1α levels in group C compared to group IPoC during ischemia and reperfusion. No other group differences could be detected. In the HIF2α stained slides, mild to moderate cytoplasmic staining yet no nuclear immunoreactivity of the enterocytes was observed, and no significant changes over time were noted.the changes in HIF1α immunoreactivity pattern and expression over time suggest that this transcription factor plays a role in the intestinal response to ischemia in horses. However, the current study could not identify an effect of IPoC on HIF distribution or expression.","['HIF', 'horse', 'hypoxia', 'ischemia', 'jejunum', 'mucosa', 'postconditioning', 'strangulation']",2022-11-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36908130,Vitamin D Receptor Regulates Autophagy to Inhibit Apoptosis and Promote Proliferation in Hepatocyte Injury.,"Oxidative stress is an important mechanism in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation occur in parallel with liver I/R injury, and the degree of apoptosis and proliferation determines the effects on hepatocytes. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) can lessen liver I/R injury, but previous studies focused mostly on inflammation and immunity.H2O2 was used to induce hepatocyte injury. Before treatment with H2O2, Hep-3B cells were pretreated with paricalcitol (PC) and siRNA-VDR. Rapamycin and chloroquine were also applied in the study.The number of apoptotic cells was measured with an annexin V (AV) -fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit. Expression of proteins was measured by western blotting. As compared with the H2O2+Hep-3B group, levels of AV/PI, cleaved caspase-3, and p62 were lower, and expression levels of Bcl-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and VDR were higher, in the PC+H2O2+Hep-3B group. When the VDR gene was silenced by siRNA-VDR in the siRNA-VDR+H2O2+Hep-3B group, expressions of AV/PI, cleaved caspase-3, and p62 were upregulated, and expressions of Bcl-2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and VDR were downregulated, as compared with values for the siRNA-NC+H2O2+Hep-3B group. Treatment with rapamycin or chloroquine partially reversed the effect of PC and siRNA-VDR on apoptosis and proliferation.VDR mediates hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation through autophagy.","['apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'hepatocyte injury', 'proliferation', 'vitamin D receptor']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36908128,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress is Involved in the Protective Effect of Sivelestat Sodium Hydrate (ONO-5046) in Spinal Cord Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Postoperative complications of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm include paraplegia due to impaired blood flow in the spinal cord. Sivelestat sodium hydrate (ONO-5046), a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor, can prevent neuropathy after ischemia-reperfusion of the spinal cord; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we examined whether ONO-5046 elicits its protective effects in spinal cord ischemia by affecting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.Forty-five male Japanese white rabbits (weight 2.5-3.0 kg) were assigned to three groups: a sham control group (n = 5), and two other groups (n = 20, respectively; n = 5 each time point) that were subjected to spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion for 15 min and administered saline or ONO-5046 intravenously. From 8 h to 7 d after resumption of blood flow, a neurological evaluation, histological evaluation of the spinal cord, and immunohistochemical evaluation based on the expression of GRP78 and caspase12 were performed.Rabbits treated with ONO-5046 had fewer functional deficits and more surviving motor neurons after ischemia than did rabbits in the saline and control groups. In rabbits treated with ONO-5046, histological findings of the spinal cord showed a high number of viable motor nerves, whereas induction of GRP78, an ER stress response-related protein, was prolonged. Furthermore, caspase12 expression was activated by excessive ER stress and was downregulated in rabbits treated with ONO-5046, as compared with that in rabbits administered saline.ONO-5046 exerts a protective effect on the spinal cord by relieving ER stress during spinal cord ischemia.","['endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'rabbits', 'sivelestat']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36907990,Salidroside postconditioning attenuates ferroptosis-mediated lung ischemia-reperfusion injury by activating the Nrf2/SLC7A11 signaling axis.,"Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent programmed necrosis, is linked to lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. Salidroside is a glycoside derived from the Rhodiola rosea plant that exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it is uncertain whether salidroside alleviates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. This investigation explored the function of salidroside in ferroptosis in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury.A lung ischemia-reperfusion model was established in wild-type and Nrf2-/- mice, and pulmonary epithelial cells were exposed to hypoxia/regeneration in vitro. We evaluated ferroptosis-related factors by western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. To investigate the regulation of Nrf2 by salidroside, coimmunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays were used. Transwell assays were used to detect macrophage migration.The data indicated that salidroside postconditioning significantly reduced ferroptosis and alleviated lung ischemia-reperfusion injury in wild-type mice, as evidenced by improved histology and inflammation, reduced lipid peroxides and iron overload, and the induction of Nrf2, SLC7A11, and GPX4 expression. Salidroside activated Nrf2 signaling, resulting in Keap1-Nrf2 dissociation, nuclear translocation, and increased antioxidant-response element reporter activity. Sal consistently inhibited hypoxia/regeneration-induced pulmonary epithelial cell ferroptosis by activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, ferroptotic cells recruited macrophages via CCL2, whereas salidroside lowered CCL2 expression and inhibited ferroptosis-induced macrophage chemotaxis in lung ischemia-reperfusion injury. Additionally, the antiferroptotic effects of salidroside against lung ischemia-reperfusion injury were eliminated in Nrf2-/- mice.This study clearly shows that salidroside postconditioning attenuates ferroptosis-mediated lung ischemia-reperfusion injury by activating the Nrf2/SLC7A11 signaling axis.","['Ferroptosis', 'Lung ischemia–reperfusion', 'Nrf2', 'SLC7A11', 'Salidroside']",2022-11-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36907201,Thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke: current status and future perspectives.,"Alteplase is currently the only approved thrombolytic agent for treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, but interest is burgeoning in the development of new thrombolytic agents for systemic reperfusion with an improved safety profile, increased efficacy, and convenient delivery. Tenecteplase has emerged as a potential alternative thrombolytic agent that might be preferred over alteplase because of its ease of administration and reported efficacy in patients with large vessel occlusion. Ongoing research efforts are also looking at potential improvements in recanalisation with the use of adjunct therapies to intravenous thrombolysis. New treatment strategies are also emerging that aim to reduce the risk of vessel reocclusion after intravenous thrombolysis administration. Other research endeavors are looking at the use of intra-arterial thrombolysis after mechanical thrombectomy to induce tissue reperfusion. The growing implementation of mobile stroke units and advanced neuroimaging could boost the number of patients who can receive intravenous thrombolysis by shortening onset-to-treatment times and identifying patients with salvageable penumbra. Continued improvements in this area will be essential to facilitate the ongoing research endeavors and to improve delivery of new interventions.",[],2022-09-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36906993,Neuroprotective effects of carnosine in a mice stroke model concerning oxidative stress and inflammatory response.,"Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a natural dipeptide with multiple neuroprotective properties. Previous studies have advertised that carnosine scavenges free radicals and displays anti-inflammatory activity. However, the underlying mechanism and the efficacies of its pleiotropic effect on prevention remained obscure. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti-oxidative, anti-inflammative, and anti-pyroptotic effects of carnosine in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model. After a daily pre-treatment of saline or carnosine (1000 mg / kg / day) for 14 days, mice (n = 24) were subjected to tMCAO for 60 min and continuously treated with saline or carnosine for additional 1 and 5 days after reperfusion. The administration of carnosine significantly decreased infarct volume 5 days after the tMCAO (*p < 0.05) and effectively suppressed the expression of 4-HNE, 8-OHdG, Nitrotyrosine 5 days, and RAGE 5 days after tMCAO. Moreover, the expression of IL-1β was also significantly suppressed 5 days after tMCAO. Our present findings demonstrated that carnosine effectively relieves oxidative stress caused by ischemic stroke and significantly attenuates neuroinflammatory responses related to IL-1β, suggesting that carnosine can be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.","['Carnosine', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Middle cerebral artery occlusion', 'Oxidative stress', 'Pyroptosis']",2022-06-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36906977,Hydrogen sulfide and its donors for the treatment of cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury: A comprehensive review.,"As an endogenous gas signalling molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is frequently present in a variety of mammals and plays a significant role in the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in large quantities as a result of cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion, which is a very serious class of cerebrovascular diseases. ROS cause oxidative stress and induce specific gene expression that results in apoptosis. H2S reduces cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion-induced secondary injury via anti-oxidative stress injury, suppression of the inflammatory response, inhibition of apoptosis, attenuation of cerebrovascular endothelial cell injury, modulation of autophagy, and antagonism of P2X7 receptors, and it plays an important biological role in other cerebral ischaemic injury events. Despite the many limitations of the hydrogen sulfide therapy delivery strategy and the difficulty in controlling the ideal concentration, relevant experimental evidence demonstrating that H2S plays an excellent neuroprotective role in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). This paper examines the synthesis and metabolism of the gas molecule H2S in the brain as well as the molecular mechanisms of H2S donors in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury and possibly other unknown biological functions. With the active development in this field, it is expected that this review will assist researchers in their search for the potential value of hydrogen sulfide and provide new ideas for preclinical trials of exogenous H2S.","['Cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury', 'H(2)S donors', 'Hydrogen sulfide', 'Neuroprotective', 'Oxidative stress', 'P2X7 receptor']",2023-02-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36906617,DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) drives chronic kidney disease progression in male mice.,"Kidney injury initiates epithelial dedifferentiation and myofibroblast activation during the progression of chronic kidney disease. Herein, we find that the expression of DNA-PKcs is significantly increased in the kidney tissues of both chronic kidney disease patients and male mice induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction and unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury. In vivo, knockout of DNA-PKcs or treatment with its specific inhibitor NU7441 hampers the development of chronic kidney disease in male mice. In vitro, DNA-PKcs deficiency preserves epithelial cell phenotype and inhibits fibroblast activation induced by transforming growth factor-beta 1. Additionally, our results show that TAF7, as a possible substrate of DNA-PKcs, enhances mTORC1 activation by upregulating RAPTOR expression, which subsequently promotes metabolic reprogramming in injured epithelial cells and myofibroblasts. Taken together, DNA-PKcs can be inhibited to correct metabolic reprogramming via the TAF7/mTORC1 signaling in chronic kidney disease, and serve as a potential target for treating chronic kidney disease.",[],2022-01-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36906586,Activation of immune signals during organ transplantation.,"The activation of host's innate and adaptive immune systems can lead to acute and chronic graft rejection, which seriously impacts graft survival. Thus, it is particularly significant to clarify the immune signals, which are critical to the initiation and maintenance of rejection generated after transplantation. The initiation of response to graft is dependent on sensing of danger and stranger molecules. The ischemia and reperfusion of grafts lead to cell stress or death, followed by releasing a variety of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of host immune cells to activate intracellular immune signals and induce sterile inflammation. In addition to DAMPs, the graft exposed to 'non-self' antigens (stranger molecules) are recognized by the host immune system, stimulating a more intense immune response and further aggravating the graft damage. The polymorphism of MHC genes between different individuals is the key for host or donor immune cells to identify heterologous 'non-self' components in allogeneic and xenogeneic organ transplantation. The recognition of 'non-self' antigen by immune cells mediates the activation of immune signals between donor and host, resulting in adaptive memory immunity and innate trained immunity to the graft, which poses a challenge to the long-term survival of the graft. This review focuses on innate and adaptive immune cells receptor recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns, alloantigens and xenoantigens, which is described as danger model and stranger model. In this review, we also discuss the innate trained immunity in organ transplantation.",[],2022-10-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36906480,Tourniquet-induced ischemia creates increased risk of organ dysfunction and mortality following delayed limb amputation.,"Tourniquets are critical for the control of traumatic extremity hemorrhage. In this study, we sought to determine, in a rodent blast-related extremity amputation model, the impact of prolonged tourniquet application and delayed limb amputation on survival, systemic inflammation, and remote end organ injury. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to blast overpressure (120±7 kPa) and orthopedic extremity injury consisting femur fracture, one-minute soft tissue crush injury (20 psi), ± 180 min of tourniquet-induced hindlimb ischemia followed by delayed (60 min of reperfusion) hindlimb amputation (dHLA). All animals in the non-tourniquet group survived whereas 7/21 (33%) of the animals in the tourniquet group died within the first 72 h with no deaths observed between 72 and 168 h post-injury. Tourniquet induced ischemia-reperfusion injury (tIRI) likewise resulted in a more robust systemic inflammation (cytokines and chemokines) and concomitant remote pulmonary, renal, and hepatic dysfunction (BUN, CR, ALT. AST, IRI/inflammation-mediated genes). These results indicate prolonged tourniquet application and dHLA increases risk of complications from tIRI, leading to greater risk of local and systemic complications including organ dysfunction or death. We thus need enhanced strategies to mitigate the systemic effects of tIRI, particularly in the military prolonged field care (PFC) setting. Furthermore, future work is needed to extend the window within which tourniquet deflation to assess limb viability remains feasible, as well as new, limb-specific or systemic point of care tests to better assess the risks of tourniquet deflation with limb preservation in order to optimize patient care and save both limb and life.","['Blast', 'Extremity trauma', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia reperfusion injury', 'Multi-organ dysfunction', 'Rat', 'Rattus norvegicus', 'Tourniquet']",2022-11-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36906251,Augmented Parkin-dependent mitophagy underlies the hepatoprotective effect of remote ischemic conditioning used prior to hemorrhagic shock.,"Hemorrhagic shock-resuscitation (HSR) following trauma contributes to organ dysfunction by causing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We previously showed that 'remote ischemic preconditioning' (RIPC) exerted multi-organ protection from IRI. Maintenance of mitochondrial quality by clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy is vital in restoring organ integrity. We hypothesized that parkin-dependent mitophagy played a role in RIPC-induced hepatoprotection following HSR.The hepatoprotective effect of RIPC in a murine model of HSR-IRI was investigated in wild type and parkin-/- animals. Mice were subjected to HSR ± RIPC and blood and organs were collected, followed by cytokine ELISAs, histology, qPCR, Western blots, and transmission electron microscopy.HSR increased hepatocellular injury, as measured by plasma ALT and liver necrosis, while antecedent RIPC prevented this injury; in parkin-/- mice, RIPC failed to exert hepatoprotection. The ability of RIPC to lessen HSR-induced rises in plasma IL-6 and TNFα, was lost in parkin-/- mice. While RIPC alone did not induce mitophagy, the application of RIPC prior to HSR caused a synergistic increase in mitophagy, this increase was not observed in parkin-/- mice. RIPC induced shifts in mitochondrial morphology favoring mitophagy in WT but not in parkin-/- animals.RIPC was hepatoprotective in WT mice following HSR but not in parkin-/- mice.

36903613,The Protective Effect of (-)-Tetrahydroalstonine against OGD/R-Induced Neuronal Injury via Autophagy Regulation.,"Here, (-)-Tetrahydroalstonine (THA) was isolated from Alstonia scholaris and investigated for its neuroprotective effect towards oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal damage. In this study, primary cortical neurons were pre-treated with THA and then subjected to OGD/R induction. The cell viability was tested by the MTT assay, and the states of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway and Akt/mTOR pathway were monitored by Western blot analysis. The findings suggested that THA administration increased the cell viability of OGD/R-induced cortical neurons. Autophagic activity and lysosomal dysfunction were found at the early stage of OGD/R, which were significantly ameliorated by THA treatment. Meanwhile, the protective effect of THA was significantly reversed by the lysosome inhibitor. Additionally, THA significantly activated the Akt/mTOR pathway, which was suppressed after OGD/R induction. In summary, THA exhibited promising protective effects against OGD/R-induced neuronal injury by autophagy regulation through the Akt/mTOR pathway.","['(-)-Tetrahydroalstonine', 'Akt/mTOR', 'OGD/R', 'autophagy', 'cerebral ischemia']",2023-01-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36903347,The Pleiotropic Role of Extracellular ATP in Myocardial Remodelling.,"Myocardial remodelling is a molecular, cellular, and interstitial adaptation of the heart in response to altered environmental demands. The heart undergoes reversible physiological remodelling in response to changes in mechanical loading or irreversible pathological remodelling induced by neurohumoral factors and chronic stress, leading to heart failure. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is one of the potent mediators in cardiovascular signalling that act on the ligand-gated (P2X) and G-protein-coupled (P2Y) purinoceptors via the autocrine or paracrine manners. These activations mediate numerous intracellular communications by modulating the production of other messengers, including calcium, growth factors, cytokines, and nitric oxide. ATP is known to play a pleiotropic role in cardiovascular pathophysiology, making it a reliable biomarker for cardiac protection. This review outlines the sources of ATP released under physiological and pathological stress and its cell-specific mechanism of action. We further highlight a series of cardiovascular cell-to-cell communications of extracellular ATP signalling cascades in cardiac remodelling, which can be seen in hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and atrophy. Finally, we summarize current pharmacological intervention using the ATP network as a target for cardiac protection. A better understanding of ATP communication in myocardial remodelling could be worthwhile for future drug development and repurposing and the management of cardiovascular diseases.","['current pharmacological intervention in cardiovascular system', 'drug repurposing', 'extracellular ATP', 'mechanism of action', 'myocardial remodelling', 'purinergic receptor', 'purinergic signalling']",2023-01-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902927,Development and Characterization of Innovative Multidrug Nanoformulation for Cardiac Therapy.,"For several decades, various peptides have been under investigation to prevent ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, including cyclosporin A (CsA) and Elamipretide. Therapeutic peptides are currently gaining momentum as they have many advantages over small molecules, such as better selectivity and lower toxicity. However, their rapid degradation in the bloodstream is a major drawback that limits their clinical use, due to their low concentration at the site of action. To overcome these limitations, we have developed new bioconjugates of Elamipretide by covalent coupling with polyisoprenoid lipids, such as squalenic acid or solanesol, embedding self-assembling ability. The resulting bioconjugates were co-nanoprecipitated with CsA squalene bioconjugate to form Elamipretide decorated nanoparticles (NPs). The subsequent composite NPs were characterized with respect to mean diameter, zeta potential, and surface composition by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (CryoTEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometry (XPS). Further, these multidrug NPs were found to have less than 20% cytotoxicity on two cardiac cell lines even at high concentrations, while maintaining an antioxidant capacity. These multidrug NPs could be considered for further investigations as an approach to target two important pathways involved in the development of cardiac I/R lesions.","['antioxidant capacity', 'bioconjugate', 'cytotoxicity', 'nanoparticles', 'therapeutic peptide']",2022-12-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902572,How to Best Protect Kidneys for Transplantation-Mechanistic Target.,"The increasing number of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list underlines the need to expand the donor pool and improve kidney graft utilization. By protecting kidney grafts adequately from the initial ischemic and subsequent reperfusion injury occurring during transplantation, both the number and quality of kidney grafts could be improved. The last few years have seen the emergence of many new technologies to abrogate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, including dynamic organ preservation through machine perfusion and organ reconditioning therapies. Although machine perfusion is gradually making the transition to clinical practice, reconditioning therapies have not yet progressed from the experimental setting, pointing towards a translational gap. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the biological processes implicated in I/R injury and explore the strategies and interventions that are being proposed to either prevent I/R injury, treat its deleterious consequences, or support the reparative response of the kidney. Prospects to improve the clinical translation of these therapies are discussed with a particular focus on the need to address multiple aspects of I/R injury to achieve robust and long-lasting protective effects on the kidney graft.","['ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'kidney preservation', 'kidney reconditioning', 'machine perfusion']",2023-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902538,Inhibition of γδ-TcR or IL17a Reduces T-Cell and Neutrophil Infiltration after Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Mouse Liver.,"Neutrophil and T-cell recruitment contribute to hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury. The initial inflammatory response is orchestrated by Kupffer cells and liver sinusoid endothelial cells. However, other cell types, including γδ-Τ cells, seem to be key mediators in further inflammatory cell recruitment and proinflammatory cytokine release, including IL17a. In this study, we used an in vivo model of partial hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) to investigate the role of the γδ-Τ-cell receptor (γδTcR) and the role of IL17a in the pathogenesis of liver injury. Forty C57BL6 mice were subjected to 60 min of ischemia followed by 6 h of reperfusion (RN 6339/2/2016). Pretreatment with either anti-γδΤcR antibodies or anti-IL17a antibodies resulted in a reduction in histological and biochemical markers of liver injury as well as neutrophil and T-cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokine production and the downregulation of c-Jun and NF-κΒ. Overall, neutralizing either γδTcR or IL17a seems to have a protective role in liver IRI.","['Th17', 'Treg', 'hepatic injury', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'liver surgery', 'liver transplantation', 'γδ-Τ cells']",2023-01-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902505,Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Its Cardioprotective Abilities: A Systematic Review.,"Despite the vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) being used in neuroscience, it has recently been highlighted that it has cardioprotective functions. However, many studies related to VNS are not mechanistic in nature. This systematic review aims to focus on the role of VNS in cardioprotective therapy, selective vagus nerve stimulators (sVNS), and their functional capabilities. A systemic review of the current literature was conducted on VNS, sVNS, and their ability to induce positive effects on arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, and heart failure. Both experimental and clinical studies were reviewed and assessed separately. Of 522 research articles retrieved from literature archives, 35 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Literature analysis proves that combining fiber-type selectivity with spatially-targeted vagus nerve stimulation is feasible. The role of VNS as a tool for modulating heart dynamics, inflammatory response, and structural cellular components was prominently seen across the literature. The application of transcutaneous VNS, as opposed to implanted electrodes, provides the best clinical outcome with minimal side effects. VNS presents a method for future cardiovascular treatment that can modulate human cardiac physiology. However, continued research is needed for further insight.","['atrial fibrillation', 'autonomic nervous system', 'cardiac arrest', 'heart failure', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'selective vagus nerve stimulation', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'ventricular fibrillation']",2022-12-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902487,Ginsenoside Rb1 Improves Post-Cardiac Arrest Myocardial Stunning and Cerebral Outcomes by Regulating the Keap1/Nrf2 Pathway.,"The prognosis of cardiac arrest (CA) is dismal despite the ongoing progress in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). ginsenoside Rb1 (Gn-Rb1) has been verified to be cardioprotective in cardiac remodeling and cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but its role is less known in CA. After 15 min of potassium chloride-induced CA, male C57BL/6 mice were resuscitated. Gn-Rb1 was blindly randomized to mice after 20 s of CPR. We assessed the cardiac systolic function before CA and 3 h after CPR. Mortality rates, neurological outcome, mitochondrial homeostasis, and the levels of oxidative stress were evaluated. We found that Gn-Rb1 improved the long-term survival during the post-resuscitation period but did not affect the ROSC rate. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that Gn-Rb1 ameliorated CA/CPR-induced mitochondrial destabilization and oxidative stress, partially via the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 axis. Gn-Rb1 improved the neurological outcome after resuscitation partially by balancing the oxidative stress and suppressing apoptosis. In sum, Gn-Rb1 protects against post-CA myocardial stunning and cerebral outcomes via the induction of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which may offer a new insight into therapeutic strategies for CA.","['Nrf2', 'cardiac arrest', 'cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'ginsenoside Rb1', 'mitochondria', 'myocardial stunning']",2022-12-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902195,Cardiac Roles of Serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT-Receptors in Health and Disease.,"Serotonin acts solely via 5-HT4-receptors to control human cardiac contractile function. The effects of serotonin via 5-HT4-receptors lead to positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, as well as arrhythmias, in the human heart. In addition, 5-HT4-receptors may play a role in sepsis, ischaemia, and reperfusion. These presumptive effects of 5-HT4-receptors are the focus of the present review. We also discuss the formation and inactivation of serotonin in the body, namely, in the heart. We identify cardiovascular diseases where serotonin might play a causative or additional role. We address the mechanisms which 5-HT4-receptors can use for cardiac signal transduction and their possible roles in cardiac diseases. We define areas where further research in this regard should be directed in the future, and identify animal models that might be generated to this end. Finally, we discuss in what regard 5-HT4-receptor agonists or antagonists might be useful drugs that could enter clinical practice. Serotonin has been the target of many studies for decades; thus, we found it timely to summarise our current knowledge here.","['5-HT4-serotonin receptors', 'human atrium', 'human ventricle', 'serotonin', 'transgenic mouse']",2023-01-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902176,The Yin and Yang Effect of the Apelinergic System in Oxidative Stress.,"Apelin is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ and has multiple biological activities in human tissues and organs, including the heart, blood vessels, adipose tissue, central nervous system, lungs, kidneys, and liver. This article reviews the crucial role of apelin in regulating oxidative stress-related processes by promoting prooxidant or antioxidant mechanisms. Following the binding of APJ to different active apelin isoforms and the interaction with several G proteins according to cell types, the apelin/APJ system is able to modulate different intracellular signaling pathways and biological functions, such as vascular tone, platelet aggregation and leukocytes adhesion, myocardial activity, ischemia/reperfusion injury, insulin resistance, inflammation, and cell proliferation and invasion. As a consequence of these multifaceted properties, the role of the apelinergic axis in the pathogenesis of degenerative and proliferative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, osteoporosis, and cancer) is currently investigated. In this view, the dual effect of the apelin/APJ system in the regulation of oxidative stress needs to be more extensively clarified, in order to identify new potential strategies and tools able to selectively modulate this axis according to the tissue-specific profile.","['APJ', 'apelin', 'apelinergic system', 'oxidative stress']",2023-01-26,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902067,Sterile Pancreas Inflammation during Preservation and after Transplantation.,"The pancreas is very susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Early graft losses due to pancreatitis and thrombosis represent a major issue after pancreas transplantation. Sterile inflammation during organ procurement (during brain death and ischemia-reperfusion) and after transplantation affects organ outcomes. Sterile inflammation of the pancreas linked to ischemia-reperfusion injury involves the activation of innate immune cell subsets such as macrophages and neutrophils, following tissue damage and release of damage-associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Macrophages and neutrophils favor tissue invasion by other immune cells, have deleterious effects or functions, and promote tissue fibrosis. However, some innate cell subsets may promote tissue repair. This outburst of sterile inflammation promotes adaptive immunity activation via antigen exposure and activation of antigen-presenting cells. Better controlling sterile inflammation during pancreas preservation and after transplantation is of utmost interest in order to decrease early allograft loss (in particular thrombosis) and increase long-term allograft survival. In this regard, perfusion techniques that are currently being implemented represent a promising tool to decrease global inflammation and modulate the immune response.","['ischemia-reperfusion', 'pancreas', 'thrombosis', 'transplantation']",2022-12-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902062,Stem Cells in Kidney Ischemia: From Inflammation and Fibrosis to Renal Tissue Regeneration.,"Ischemic nephropathy consists of progressive renal function loss due to renal hypoxia, inflammation, microvascular rarefaction, and fibrosis. We provide a literature review focused on kidney hypoperfusion-dependent inflammation and its influence on renal tissue's ability to self-regenerate. Moreover, an overview of the advances in regenerative therapy with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) infusion is provided. Based on our search, we can point out the following conclusions: 1. endovascular reperfusion is the gold-standard therapy for RAS, but its success mostly depends on treatment timeliness and a preserved downstream vascular bed; 2. anti-RAAS drugs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and/or anti-endothelin agents are especially recommended for patients with renal ischemia who are not eligible for endovascular reperfusion for slowing renal damage progression; 3. TGF-β, MCP-1, VEGF, and NGAL assays, along with BOLD MRI, should be extended in clinical practice and applied to a pre- and post-revascularization protocols; 4. MSC infusion appears effective in renal regeneration and could represent a revolutionary treatment for patients with fibrotic evolution of renal ischemia.","['NGAL', 'chronic kidney disease', 'ischemic nephropathy', 'renal artery stenosis', 'renal hypoxia', 'renal staminal cells', 'renal tissue oxygenation']",2023-02-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902036,Tumor Necrosis Factor Family Members and Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury: State of the Art and Therapeutic Implications.,"Ischemic heart disease is the principal cause of death worldwide and clinically manifests as myocardial infarction (MI), stable angina, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial infarction is defined as an irreversible injury due to severe and prolonged myocardial ischemia inducing myocardial cell death. Revascularization is helpful in reducing loss of contractile myocardium and improving clinical outcome. Reperfusion rescues myocardium from cell death but also induces an additional injury called ischemia-reperfusion injury. Multiple mechanisms are involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury, such as oxidative stress, intracellular calcium overload, apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, and inflammation. Various members of the tumor necrosis factor family play a key role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this article, the role of TNFα, CD95L/CD95, TRAIL, and the RANK/RANKL/OPG axis in the regulation of myocardial tissue damage is reviewed together with their potential use as a therapeutic target.","['myocardial infarction', 'myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'tumor necrosis factor family']",2023-01-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36902008,Small Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells in the Treatment of Myocardial Injury.,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) therapy brings great hope to the treatment of myocardial injuries, while extracellular vesicles may be one of the main mechanisms of its action. iPSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (iPSCs-sEVs) can carry genetic and proteinaceous substances and mediate the interaction between iPSCs and target cells. In recent years, more and more studies have focused on the therapeutic effect of iPSCs-sEVs in myocardial injury. IPSCs-sEVs may be a new cell-free-based treatment for myocardial injury, including myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. In the current research on myocardial injury, the extraction of sEVs from mesenchymal stem cells induced by iPSCs was widely used. Isolation methods of iPSCs-sEVs for the treatment of myocardial injury include ultracentrifugation, isodensity gradient centrifugation, and size exclusion chromatography. Tail vein injection and intraductal administration are the most widely used routes of iPSCs-sEV administration. The characteristics of sEVs derived from iPSCs which were induced from different species and organs, including fibroblasts and bone marrow, were further compared. In addition, the beneficial genes of iPSC can be regulated through CRISPR/Cas9 to change the composition of sEVs and improve the abundance and expression diversity of them. This review focused on the strategies and mechanisms of iPSCs-sEVs in the treatment of myocardial injury, which provides a reference for future research and the application of iPSCs-sEVs.","['exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'heart', 'induced pluripotent stem cells', 'mechanisms', 'myocardial injury']",2023-01-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36900926,A Single Bout of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Suppresses Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Asian Obese Young Men.,"Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to minimize subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), whereas obesity has been suggested to attenuate the efficacy of RIPC in animal models. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a single bout of RIPC on the vascular and autonomic response after IRI in young obese men. A total of 16 healthy young men (8 obese and 8 normal weight) underwent two experimental trials: RIPC (three cycles of 5 min ischemia at 180 mmHg + 5 min reperfusion on the left thigh) and SHAM (the same RIPC cycles at resting diastolic pressure) following IRI (20 min ischemia at 180 mmHg + 20 min reperfusion on the right thigh). Heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure (SBP/DBP), and cutaneous blood flow (CBF) were measured between baseline, post-RIPC/SHAM, and post-IRI. The results showed that RIPC significantly improved the LF/HF ratio (p = 0.027), SBP (p = 0.047), MAP (p = 0.049), CBF (p = 0.001), cutaneous vascular conductance (p = 0.003), vascular resistance (p = 0.001), and sympathetic reactivity (SBP: p = 0.039; MAP: p = 0.084) after IRI. However, obesity neither exaggerated the degree of IRI nor attenuated the conditioning effects on the measured outcomes. In conclusion, a single bout of RIPC is an effective means of suppressing subsequent IRI and obesity, at least in Asian young adult men, does not significantly attenuate the efficacy of RIPC.","['cutaneous blood flow', 'heart rate variability', 'obesity', 'remote ischemic preconditioning', 'sympathetic reactivity']",2022-12-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36899937,Tubule-Derived Follistatin Is Increased in the Urine of Rats with Renal Ischemia and Reflects the Severity of Acute Tubular Damage.,"Activin A, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, is a negative regulator of tubular regeneration after renal ischemia. Activin action is controlled by an endogenous antagonist, follistatin. However, the role of follistatin in the kidney is not fully understood. In the present study, we examined the expression and localization of follistatin in normal and ischemic rat kidneys and measured urinary follistatin in rats with renal ischemia to assess whether urinary follistatin could serve as a biomarker for acute kidney injury. Using vascular clamps, renal ischemia was induced for 45 min in 8-week-old male Wistar rats. In normal kidneys, follistatin was localized in distal tubules of the cortex. In contrast, in ischemic kidneys, follistatin was localized in distal tubules of both the cortex and outer medulla. Follistatin mRNA was mainly present in the descending limb of Henle of the outer medulla in normal kidneys but was upregulated in the descending limb of Henle of both the outer and inner medulla after renal ischemia. Urinary follistatin, which was undetectable in normal rats, was significantly increased in ischemic rats and peaked 24 h after reperfusion. There was no correlation between urinary follistatin and serum follistatin. Urinary follistatin levels were increased according to ischemic duration and were significantly correlated with the follistatin-positive area as well as the acute tubular damage area. These results suggest that follistatin normally produced by renal tubules increases and becomes detectable in urine after renal ischemia. Urinary follistatin might be useful to assess the severity of acute tubular damage.","['acute kidney injury', 'follistatin', 'ischemia reperfusion']",2023-01-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36899927,The Complement System in Kidney Transplantation.,"Kidney transplantation is the therapy of choice for patients who suffer from end-stage renal diseases. Despite improvements in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive treatments, long-term graft survival remains a challenge. A large body of evidence documented that the complement cascade, a part of the innate immune system, plays a crucial role in the deleterious inflammatory reactions that occur during the transplantation process, such as brain or cardiac death of the donor and ischaemia/reperfusion injury. In addition, the complement system also modulates the responses of T cells and B cells to alloantigens, thus playing a crucial role in cellular as well as humoral responses to the allograft, which lead to damage to the transplanted kidney. Since several drugs that are capable of inhibiting complement activation at various stages of the complement cascade are emerging and being developed, we will discuss how these novel therapies could have potential applications in ameliorating outcomes in kidney transplantations by preventing the deleterious effects of ischaemia/reperfusion injury, modulating the adaptive immune response, and treating antibody-mediated rejection.","['alloresponse', 'antibody-mediated rejection', 'complement activation', 'complement therapeutics', 'delayed graft function', 'ischaemia/reperfusion injury', 'kidney transplantation']",2023-01-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36899148,Effect of remote ischemic preconditioning on postoperative gastrointestinal function in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection.,"Patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection have a high incidence of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (POGD). Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is an organ protection measure. The study investigated the effect of RIPC on postoperative gastrointestinal function.In this single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized, parallel-controlled trial, 100 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive RIPC or sham RIPC (control). Three cycles of 5-min ischemia/5-min reperfusion induced by a blood pressure cuff placed on the right upper arm served as RIPC stimulus. Patients were followed up continuously for 7 days after surgery. The I-FEED score was used to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal function after the surgery. The primary outcome of the study was the I-FEED score on POD3. Secondary outcomes include the daily I-FEED scores, the highest I-FEED score, the incidence of POGD, the changes in I-FABP and the inflammatory markers (IL-6 and TNF-α), and the time to first postoperative flatus.A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 13 patients were excluded. Finally, 87 patients were included in the analysis, 44 patients in the RIPC group and 43 patients in the sham-RIPC group. Patients assigned to the RIPC group had a lower I-FEED score on POD3 compared with the sham-RIPC group (mean difference 0.86; 95% CI: 0.06 to 1.65; P = 0.035). And patients in the RIPC group were also associated with a lower I-FEED score on POD4 vs the sham-RIPC group (mean difference 0.81; 95% CI: 0.03 to 1.60; P = 0.043). Compared with the sham-RIPC group, the incidence of POGD within 7 days after surgery was lower in the RIPC group (P = 0.040). At T1, T2, and T3 time points, inflammatory factors and I-FABP were considerably less in the RIPC group compared to the sham-RIPC group. The time to the first flatus and the first feces was similar in both groups.RIPC reduced I-FEED scores, decreased the incidence of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction, and lowered concentrations of I-FABP and inflammatory factors.","['I-FEED score', 'Intestinal ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Postoperative gastrointestinal function', 'RIPC']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36899130,Gray level co-occurrence matrix and wavelet analyses reveal discrete changes in proximal tubule cell nuclei after mild acute kidney injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) relates to an abrupt reduction in renal function resulting from numerous conditions. Morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs related to AKI are relatively high. This condition is strongly associated with damage to proximal tubule cells (PTCs), generating distinct patterns of transcriptional and epigenetic alterations that result in structural changes in the nuclei of this epithelium. To this date, AKI-related nuclear chromatin redistribution in PTCs is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether changes in PTC chromatin patterns can be detected using conventional microscopy during mild AKI, which can progress to more debilitating forms of injury. In recent years, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) analysis and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) have emerged as potentially valuable methods for identifying discrete structural changes in nuclear chromatin architecture that are not visible during the conventional histopathological exam. Here we present findings indicating that GLCM and DWT methods can be successfully used in nephrology to detect subtle nuclear morphological alterations associated with mild tissue injury demonstrated in rodents by inducing a mild form of AKI through ischemia-reperfusion injury. Our results show that mild ischemic AKI is associated with the reduction of local textural homogeneity of PTC nuclei quantified by GLCM and the increase of nuclear structural heterogeneity indirectly assessed with DWT energy coefficients. This rodent model allowed us to show that mild ischemic AKI is associated with the significant reduction of textural homogeneity of PTC nuclei, indirectly assessed by GLCM indicators and DWT energy coefficients.",[],2022-06-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

In this study, we aimed to explore the regulatory effect and mechanism of lncRNA SOX2-overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) in MIRI. The viability of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-treated H9c2 cells was detected by MTT assay. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured by ELISA. The target relationship between SOX2-OT and miR-146a-5p was predicted by LncBase, and subsequently confirmed by Dual luciferase reporter assay. The effects of SOX2-OT silencing on myocardial apoptosis and function were further validated in MIRI rats. The expression of SOX2-OT was increased in OGD/R-treated H9c2 cells and myocardial tissues of MIRI rats. Silencing of SOX2-OT increased the viability and inhibited the inflammation and oxidative stress of OGD/R-treated H9c2 cells. SOX2-OT negatively regulated its target miR-146a-5p. Silencing of miR-146a-5p reversed the effects of sh-SOX2-OT on OGD/R-treated H9c2 cells. In addition, silencing of SOX2-OT also alleviated myocardial apoptosis and improved myocardial function in MIRI rats. Silencing of SOX2-OT relieved the apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress of myocardial cells via up-regulating miR-146a-5p, contributing to the remission of MIRI.",[],2022-07-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The associated lung ischemia/reperfusion injury is a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing DHLP; we aimed to investigate the effects of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) with continuous perfusion of pulmonary arteries (CPP) on DHLF-induced lung injury and the related molecular mechanisms. Twenty-four piglets were randomly divided into the DHLF (control), CPP (with DHLF), or CPP+PDTC (intravenous PDTC before CPP with DHLF) groups. Lung injury was evaluated by respiratory function measurement, lung immunohistochemistry, and serum levels of TNF, IL-8, IL-6, and NF-κB before CPB, at CPB completion, and at 1 h post-CPB. Western blot was used to detect NF-κB protein expression in lung tissues. After CPB, decreased parcial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and increased parcial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and serum levels of TNF, IL-8, IL-6, and NF-κB were observed in the DHLF group. Both CPP and CPP+PDTC groups showed better indices of lung function, decreased levels of TNF, IL-8, and IL-6, and less severe pulmonary edemas and injuries. PDTC with CPP further improved pulmonary function and mitigated pulmonary injury than did CPP alone. PDTC with CPP better attenuates DHLF-induced lung injury than does CPP alone.",[],2022-08-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36894877,Effect of targeted coagulopathy management and 5% albumin as volume replacement therapy during lung transplantation on allograft function: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial.,"Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation (LuTx) contributes substantially to early postoperative morbidity. Both intraoperative transfusion of a large amount of blood products during the surgery and ischemia-reperfusion injury after allograft implantation play an important role in subsequent PGD development.We have previously reported a randomized clinical trial of 67 patients where point of care (POC) targeted coagulopathy management and intraoperative administration of 5% albumin led to significant reduction of blood loss and blood product consumption during the lung transplantation surgery. A secondary analysis of the randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of targeted coagulopathy management and intraoperative administration of 5% albumin on early lung allograft function after LuTx and 1-year survival was performed.Compared to the patients in the control (non-POC) group, those in study (POC) group showed significantly superior graft function, represented by the Horowitz index (at 72 h after transplantation 402.87 vs 308.03 with p < 0.001, difference between means: 94.84, 95% CI: 60.18-129.51). Furthermore, the maximum doses of norepinephrine administered during first 24 h were significantly lower in the POC group (0.193 vs 0.379 with p < 0.001, difference between the means: 0.186, 95% CI: 0.105-0.267). After dichotomization of PGD (0-1 vs 2-3), significant difference between the non-POC and POC group occurred only at time point 72, when PGD grade 2-3 developed in 25% (n = 9) and 3.2% (n = 1), respectively (p = 0.003). The difference in 1-year survival was not statistically significant (10 patients died in non-POC group vs. 4 patients died in POC group; p = 0.17).Utilization of a POC targeted coagulopathy management combined with Albumin 5% as primary resuscitative fluid may improve early lung allograft function, provide better circulatory stability during the early post-operative period, and have potential to decrease the incidence of PGD without negative effect on 1-year survival.This clinical trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03598907).","['5% albumin', 'Anesthetic management', 'Lung transplantation', 'Rotational thromboelastometry', 'Volume replacement therapy']",2022-09-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36894806,m6A methyltransferase WTAP regulates myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury through YTHDF1/FOXO3a signaling.,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is emerging as an essential regulator in the progression of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the in-depth functions and mechanisms for m6A are still unclear. This work aimed to explore the potential functions and mechanisms for myocardial I/R injury. In this study, m6A methyltransferase WTAP and m6A modification level elevated in the hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced rat cardiomyocytes (H9C2) and I/R injury rat model. Bio-functional cellular experiments demonstrated that knockdown of WTAP remarkably released the proliferation and reduced the apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines induced by H/R. Moreover, exercise training alleviated WTAP level in exercise-trained rats. Mechanistically, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) revealed that a remarkable m6A modification site was found in the 3'-UTR of FOXO3a mRNA. Moreover, WTAP triggered the installation of m6A modification on FOXO3a mRNA through m6A reader YTHDF1, thereby enhancing the stability of FOXO3a mRNA. Collectively, WTAP/YTHDF1/m6A/FOXO3a axis regulates the myocardial I/R injury progression, which provides new insights for the treatment of myocardial injury.","['FOXO3a', 'Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury', 'N6-methyladenosine', 'WTAP']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36894047,USP25-PKM2-glycolysis axis contributes to ischemia reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury by promoting M1-like macrophage polarization and proinflammatory response.,"M1-like macrophages have been reported to play critical roles in acute kidney injury (AKI). Here, we elucidated the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (USP25) in M1-like macrophages polarization and AKI. High USP25 expression was correlated with a decline in renal function in patients with acute kidney tubular injury and in mice with AKI. In contrast, USP25 knockout reduced M1-like macrophage infiltration, suppressed M1-like polarization, and improved AKI in mice, indicating that USP25 was necessary for M1-like polarization and proinflammatory response. Immunoprecipitation assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry showed that the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, muscle (PKM2) was a target substrate of USP25. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated the USP25 regulated aerobic glycolysis and lactate production during M1-like polarization via PKM2. Further analysis showed that the USP25-PKM2-aerobic glycolysis axis positively regulated M1-like polarization and exacerbated AKI in mice, providing potential therapeutic targets for AKI treatment.","['Acute kidney injury', 'Aerobic glycolysis', 'Ischemia-reperfusion', 'M1-like macrophage', 'PKM2', 'Ubiquitin-specific protease 25']",2023-01-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36893823,An MMP-9 exclusive neutralizing antibody attenuates blood-brain barrier breakdown in mice with stroke and reduces stroke patient-derived MMP-9 activity.,"Rapid upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) leads to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown following stroke, but no MMP-9 inhibitors have been approved in clinic largely due to their low specificities and side effects. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of a human IgG monoclonal antibody (mAb), L13, which was recently developed with exclusive neutralizing specificity to MMP-9, nanomolar potency, and biological function, using mouse stroke models and stroke patient samples. We found that L13 treatment at the onset of reperfusion following cerebral ischemia or after intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) significantly reduced brain tissue injury and improved the neurological outcomes of mice. Compared to control IgG, L13 substantially attenuated BBB breakdown in both types of stroke model by inhibiting MMP-9 activity-mediated degradations of basement membrane and endothelial tight junction proteins. Importantly, these BBB-protective and neuroprotective effects of L13 in wild-type mice were comparable to Mmp9 genetic deletion and fully abolished in Mmp9 knockout mice, highlighting the in vivo target specificity of L13. Meanwhile, ex vivo co-incubation with L13 significantly neutralized the enzymatic activities of human MMP-9 in the sera of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients, or in the peri-hematoma brain tissues from hemorrhagic stroke patients. Overall, we demonstrated that MMP-9 exclusive neutralizing mAbs constitute a potential feasible therapeutic approach for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.","['Antibody therapy', 'Blood-brain barrier', 'Intracranial hemorrhage', 'Ischemic stroke', 'MMP-9']",2022-12-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36893757,Oxygen toxicity causes cyclic damage by destabilizing specific Fe-S cluster-containing protein complexes.,"Oxygen is toxic across all three domains of life. Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically investigate the major cellular pathways affected by excess molecular oxygen. We find that hyperoxia destabilizes a specific subset of Fe-S cluster (ISC)-containing proteins, resulting in impaired diphthamide synthesis, purine metabolism, nucleotide excision repair, and electron transport chain (ETC) function. Our findings translate to primary human lung cells and a mouse model of pulmonary oxygen toxicity. We demonstrate that the ETC is the most vulnerable to damage, resulting in decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption. This leads to further tissue hyperoxia and cyclic damage of the additional ISC-containing pathways. In support of this model, primary ETC dysfunction in the Ndufs4 KO mouse model causes lung tissue hyperoxia and dramatically increases sensitivity to hyperoxia-mediated ISC damage. This work has important implications for hyperoxia pathologies, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, aging, and mitochondrial disorders.","['DNA damage', 'Fe-S clusters', 'hyperoxia', 'lung injury', 'mitochondria', 'oxygen', 'purine synthesis', 'redox', 'translation fidelity']",2022-05-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death found in various diseases.Our study aims to investigate the role of ferroptosis and the protective mechanism of Ginsenoside Re in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion.In the present study, we treated rats for five days with Ginsenoside Re, then established the myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury rat model to detect molecular implications in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion regulation and to determine the underlying mechanism.This study identifies the mechanism behind ginsenoside Re's effect on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and its regulation of ferroptosis through miR-144-3p. Ginsenoside Re significantly reduced cardiac damage caused by ferroptosis during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and glutathione decline. To determine how Ginsenoside Re regulated ferroptosis, we isolated exosomes from VEGFR2+ endothelial progenitor cells after ischemia/reperfusion injury and performed miRNA profiling to screen the miRNAs aberrantly expressed in the process of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and ginsenoside Re treatment. We identified that miR-144-3p was upregulated in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by luciferase report and qRT-PCR. We further confirmed that the solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) was the target gene of miR-144-3p by database analysis and western blot. In comparison with ferropstatin-1, a ferroptosis inhibitor, in vivo studies confirmed that ferropstatin-1 also diminished myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury induced cardiac function damage.We demonstrated that ginsenoside Re attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion induced ferroptosis via miR-144-3p/SLC7A11.","['Ferroptosis', 'Ginsenoside Re', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'SLC7A11', 'miR-144-3p']",2022-08-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36892998,Synaptotagmin-3 interactions with GluA2 mediate brain damage and impair functional recovery in stroke.,"Synaptotagmin III (Syt3) is a Ca2+-dependent membrane-traffic protein that is highly concentrated in synaptic plasma membranes and affects synaptic plasticity by regulating post-synaptic receptor endocytosis. Here, we show that Syt3 is upregulated in the penumbra after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Knockdown of Syt3 protects against I/R injury, promotes recovery of motor function, and inhibits cognitive decline. Overexpression of Syt3 exerts the opposite effects. Mechanistically, I/R injury augments Syt3-GluA2 interactions, decreases GluA2 surface expression, and promotes the formation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Using a CP-AMPAR antagonist or dissociating the Syt3-GluA2 complex via TAT-GluA2-3Y peptide promotes recovery from neurological impairments and improves cognitive function. Furthermore, Syt3 knockout mice are resistant to cerebral ischemia because they show high-level expression of surface GluA2 and low-level expression of CP-AMPARs after I/R. Our results indicate that Syt3-GluA2 interactions, which regulate the formation of CP-AMPARs, may be a therapeutic target for ischemic insults.",['CP: Neuroscience'],2022-03-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36892639,Anti-apoptosis effect of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Cerebral ischemia, one of the leading causes of neurological dysfunction of brain cells, muscle dysfunction, and death, brings great harm and challenges to individual health, families, and society. Blood flow disruption causes decreased glucose and oxygen, insufficient to maintain normal brain tissue metabolism, resulting in intracellular calcium overload, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity of excitatory amino acids, and inflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal cell necrosis, apoptosis, or neurological abnormalities. This paper summarizes the specific mechanism of cell injury that apoptosis triggered by reperfusion after cerebral ischemia, the related proteins involved in apoptosis, and the experimental progress of herbal medicine treatment through searching, analyzing, and summarizing the PubMed and Web Of Science databases, which includes active ingredients of herbal medicine, prescriptions, Chinese patent medicines, and herbal extracts, providing a new target or new strategy for drug treatment, and providing a reference for future experimental directions and using them to develop suitable small molecule drugs for clinical application. With the research of anti-apoptosis as the core, it is important to find highly effective, low toxicity, safe and cheap compounds from natural plants and animals with abundant resources to prevent and treat Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (CIR) and solve human suffering. In addition, understanding and summarizing the apoptotic mechanism of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, the microscopic mechanism of CIR treatment, and the cellular pathways involved will help to develop new drugs.","['Apoptosis', 'Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Molecular mechanisms', 'Traditional Chinese medicine']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36892020,Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury: Friend and Foe.,"Cerebral ischemic injury, one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, triggers various central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic ischemia-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, targeted therapies are urgently needed to address neurological disorders caused by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI), and the emergence of Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) may be able to relieve the pressure. Neutrophils are precursors to brain injury following ischemic stroke and exert complicated functions. NETs extracellularly release reticular complexes of neutrophils, i.e., double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), histones, and granulins. Paradoxically, NETs play a dual role, friend and foe, under different conditions, for example, physiological circumstances, infection, neurodegeneration, and ischemia/reperfusion. Increasing evidence indicates that NETs exert anti-inflammatory effects by degrading cytokines and chemokines through protease at a relatively stable and moderate level under physiological conditions, while excessive amounts of NETs release (NETosis) irritated by CI/RI exacerbate the inflammatory response and aggravate thrombosis, disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and initiates sequential neuron injury and tissue damage. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the machinery of NETs formation and the role of an abnormal cascade of NETs in CI/RI, as well as other ischemia-induced neurological diseases. Herein, we highlight the potential of NETs as a therapeutic target against ischemic stroke that may inspire translational research and innovative clinical approaches.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Ischemic stroke', 'cerebral ischemia', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'neutrophil extracellular traps']",2022-10-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36891903,Platelet-Derived MicroRNAs Regulate Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Ischemia.,"Platelets can infiltrate ischemic myocardium and are increasingly recognized as critical regulators of inflammatory processes during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Platelets contain a broad repertoire of microRNAs (miRNAs), which, under certain conditions such as myocardial ischemia, may be transferred to surrounding cells or released into the microenvironment. Recent studies could demonstrate that platelets contribute substantially to the circulating miRNA pool holding the potential for so far undiscovered regulatory functions. The present study aimed to determine the role of platelet-derived miRNAs in myocardial injury and repair following myocardial I/R.In vivo model of myocardial I/R, multimodal in vivo and ex vivo imaging approaches (light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, speckle-tracking echocardiography) of myocardial inflammation and remodeling, and next-generation deep sequencing analysis of platelet miRNA expression.In mice with a megakaryocyte/platelet-specific knockout of pre-miRNA processing ribonuclease Dicer, the present study discloses a key role of platelet-derived miRNAs in the tightly regulated cellular processes orchestrating left ventricular remodeling after myocardial I/R following transient left coronary artery ligation. Disruption of the miRNA processing machinery in platelets by deletion of Dicer resulted in increased myocardial inflammation, impaired angiogenesis, and accelerated development of cardiac fibrosis, culminating in an increased infarct size by d7 that persisted through d28 of myocardial I/R. Worsened cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction in mice with a platelet-specific Dicer deletion resulted in an increased fibrotic scar formation and distinguishably increased perfusion defect of the apical and anterolateral wall at day 28 post-myocardial infarction. Altogether, these observations culminated in an impaired left ventricular function and hampered long-term cardiac recovery after experimental myocardial infarction and reperfusion therapy. Treatment with the P2Y12 (P2Y purinoceptor 12) antagonist ticagrelor completely reversed increased myocardial damage and adverse cardiac remodeling observed in DicerPf4∆/Pf4∆ mice.The present study discloses a critical role of platelet-derived miRNA in myocardial inflammation and structural remodeling processes following myocardial I/R.","['blood platelets', 'inflammation', 'microRNAs', 'myocardial infarction', 'myocardial ischemia', 'reperfusion injury']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36891519,Hypothermic Perfusion Modifies the Association Between Anti-LG3 Antibodies and Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Recipients.,"We previously reported associations between autoantibodies to the LG3 fragment of perlecan, anti-LG3, and a higher risk of delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplant recipients. Here, we aimed to determine whether some factors that modulate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) can modify this association. We performed a retrospective cohort study in kidney transplant recipients in 2 university-affiliated centers. In 687 patients, we show that high pre-transplant anti-LG3 are associated with DGF when the kidney is transported on ice (odds ratio (OR): 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.02-3.00), but not when placed on hypothermic perfusion pump (OR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.43-1.37). In patients with DGF, high pre-transplant anti-LG3 are associated with a higher risk of graft failure (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR): 4.07, 95% CI: 1.80, 9.22), while this was not the case in patients with immediate graft function (SHR: 0.50, 95% CI 0.19, 1.29). High anti-LG3 levels are associated with a higher risk of DGF in kidneys exposed to cold storage, but not when hypothermic pump perfusion is used. High anti-LG3 are also associated with a higher risk of graft failure in patients who experience DGF, a clinical manifestation of severe IRI.","['anti-LG3', 'autoantibodies', 'delayed graft function', 'hypothermic perfusion', 'ischemia reperfusion injury', 'kidney allograft']",2022-07-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36891470,Selective ischemic-hemisphere targeting Ginkgolide B liposomes with improved solubility and therapeutic efficacy for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CI/RI) remains the main cause of disability and death in stroke patients due to lack of effective therapeutic strategies. One of the main issues related to CI/RI treatment is the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which affects the intracerebral delivery of drugs. Ginkgolide B (GB), a major bioactive component in commercially available products of Ginkgo biloba, has been shown significance in CI/RI treatment by regulating inflammatory pathways, oxidative damage, and metabolic disturbance, and seems to be a candidate for stroke recovery. However, limited by its poor hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, the development of GB preparations with good solubility, stability, and the ability to cross the BBB remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a combinatorial strategy by conjugating GB with highly lipophilic docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to obtain a covalent complex GB-DHA, which can not only enhance the pharmacological effect of GB, but can also be encapsulated in liposomes stably. The amount of finally constructed Lipo@GB-DHA targeting to ischemic hemisphere was validated 2.2 times that of free solution in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Compared to the marketed ginkgolide injection, Lipo@GB-DHA significantly reduced infarct volume with better neurobehavioral recovery in MCAO rats after being intravenously administered both at 2 h and 6 h post-reperfusion. Low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high neuron survival in vitro was maintained via Lipo@GB-DHA treatment, while microglia in the ischemic brain were polarized from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the tissue-repairing M2 phenotype, which modulate neuroinflammatory and angiogenesis. In addition, Lipo@GB-DHA inhibited neuronal apoptosis via regulating the apoptotic pathway and maintained homeostasis by activating the autophagy pathway. Thus, transforming GB into a lipophilic complex and loading it into liposomes provides a promising nanomedicine strategy with excellent CI/RI therapeutic efficacy and industrialization prospects.","['Brain targeting', 'Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CI/RI)', 'Docosahexaenoic acid', 'Ginkgolide B', 'Liposomes', 'Microglia']",2022-10-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36891270,Dapagliflozin alleviates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by reducing ferroptosis via MAPK signaling inhibition.,"Reperfusion is essential for ischemic myocardium but paradoxically leads to myocardial damage that worsens cardiac functions. Ferroptosis often occurs in cardiomyocytes during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) exerts cardioprotective effects independent of hypoglycemia. Here, we investigated the effect and potential mechanism of DAPA against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI)-related ferroptosis using the MIRI rat model and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Our results show that DAPA significantly ameliorated myocardial injury, reperfusion arrhythmia, and cardiac function, as evidenced by alleviated ST-segment elevation, ameliorated cardiac injury biomarkers including cTnT and BNP and pathological features, prevented H/R-triggered cell viability loss in vitro. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that DAPA inhibited ferroptosis by upregulating the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis and FTH and inhibiting ACSL4. DAPA notably mitigated oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, ferrous iron overload, and reduced ferroptosis. Subsequently, network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis suggested that the MAPK signaling pathway was a potential target of DAPA and a common mechanism of MIRI and ferroptosis. DAPA treatment significantly reduced MAPK phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that DAPA might protect against MIRI by reducing ferroptosis through the MAPK signaling pathway.","['MAPK pathway', 'dapagliflozin', 'ferroptosis', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'treatment']",2022-10-24,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36890921,The application of optical technology in the diagnosis and therapy of oxidative stress-mediated hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is defined as liver tissue damage and cell death caused by reperfusion during liver transplantation or hepatectomy. Oxidative stress is one of the important mechanisms of HIRI. Studies have shown that the incidence of HIRI is very high, however, the number of patients who can get timely and efficient treatment is small. The reason is not hard to explain that invasive ways of detection and lack of timely of diagnostic methods. Hence, a new detection method is urgently needed in clinic application. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are markers of oxidative stress in the liver, could be detected by optical imaging and offer timely and effective non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring. Optical imaging could become the most potential tool of diagnosis of HIRI in the future. In addition, optical technology can also be used in disease treatment. It found that optical therapy has the function of anti-oxidative stress. Consequently, it has possibility to treat HIRI caused by oxidative stress. In this review, we mainly summarized the application and prospect of optical techniques in oxidative stress-induced by HIRI.","['diagnosis', 'hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'optical technology', 'oxidative stress', 'treatment']",2022-12-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36890539,Microglia/macrophages require vitamin D signaling to restrain neuroinflammation and brain injury in a murine ischemic stroke model.,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with worse clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke; nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of how vitamin D signaling modulated stroke progression in male mouse ischemia-reperfusion stroke models. We found that vitamin D receptor (VDR) exhibited a predominant upregulation in peri-infarct microglia/macrophages following cerebral ischemia. Conditional Vdr inactivation in microglia/macrophages markedly augmented infarct volumes and neurological deficits. VDR-deficient microglia/macrophages exhibited a more primed proinflammatory phenotype with substantial secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ. These inflammatory cytokines further enhanced CXCL10 release from endothelial cells and blood-brain barrier disruption, and ultimately infiltration of peripheral T lymphocytes. Notably, blocking TNF-α and IFN-γ significantly ameliorated stroke phenotypes in Vdr conditional knockout mice. Collectively, VDR signaling in microglia/macrophages plays a crucial role in restraining ischemia-elicited neuroinflammation and stroke progression. Our findings delineate a novel mechanism underlying the association between vitamin D deficiency and poor stroke outcomes, and underline the significance of maintaining a functional vitamin D signaling in the management of acute ischemic stroke.","['Acute ischemic stroke', 'Microglia/macrophages', 'Neuroinflammation', 'Vitamin D deficiency', 'Vitamin D receptor']",2022-10-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Our previous study has proved that miR-92a could ameliorate kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury, but the mechanism has not been studied.This study conducted further research on the role of miR-92a in kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury and organ preservation. In vivo, mice models of bilateral kidney ischemia (30 min), cold preservation after ischemia (cold preservation time of 6, 12, and 24 h), and ischemia-reperfusion (reperfusion time of 24, 48, and 72 h) were established. Before or after modeling, the model mice were injected with miR-92a-agomir through the caudal vein. In vitro, the hypoxia-reoxygenation of HK-2 cells was used to simulate ischemia-reperfusion injury.Kidney ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion significantly damaged kidney function, decreased the expression of miR-92a, and increased apoptosis and autophagy in kidneys. miR-92a agomir tail vein injection significantly increased the expression of miR-92a in kidneys, improved kidney function, and alleviated kidney injury, and the intervention before modeling achieved a better effect than after. Moreover, miR-92a agomir significantly reduced the apoptosis and autophagy in HK-2 cells induced by hypoxia, hypoxia-reoxygenation, and rapamycin, while miR-92a antagomir had opposite effects. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinase, c-Jun NH (2) terminal kinase, caspase 3, Beclin 1, and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B were inhibited by overexpression of miR-92a both in vivo and in vitro, which in turn reduced apoptosis and autophagy.Our results prove that overexpression of miR-92a attenuated kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury and improved kidney preservation, and intervention before ischemia-reperfusion provides better protection than after.","['Apoptosis', 'Autophagy', 'Ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Kidney transplant', 'miR-92a']",2022-08-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36889637,Mildronate Has Ameliorative Effects on the Experimental Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Model in the Rabbit Spinal Cord.,"Mildronate is a useful anti-ischemic agent and has antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of mildronate in the experimental rabbit spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury (SCIRI) model.Rabbits were randomized into 5 groups of 8 animals as groups 1 (control), 2 (ischemia), 3 (vehicle), 4 (30 mg/kg methylprednisolone [MP]), and 5 (100 mg/kg mildronate). The control group underwent only laparotomy. The other groups have the spinal cord ischemia model by a 20-minute aortic occlusion just caudal to the renal artery. The malondialdehyde and catalase levels and caspase-3, myeloperoxidase, and xanthine oxidase activities were investigated. Neurologic, histopathologic, and ultrastructural evaluations were also performed.The serum and tissue myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and caspase-3 values of the ischemia and vehicle groups were statistically significantly higher than those of the MP and mildronate groups (P < 0.001). Serum and tissue catalase values of the ischemia and vehicle groups were statistically significantly lower than those of the control, MP, and mildronate groups (P < 0.001). The histopathologic evaluation showed a statistically significantly lower score in the mildronate and MP groups than in the ischemia and vehicle groups (P < 0.001). The modified Tarlov scores of the ischemia and vehicle groups were statistically significantly lower than those of the control, MP, and mildronate groups (P < 0.001).This study presented the antiinflammatory, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and neuroprotective effects of mildronate on SCIRI.

36889378,The role of histone deacetylases in cardiac energy metabolism in heart diseases.,"Heart diseases are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. The underlying mechanisms and pathological changes associated with cardiac diseases are exceptionally complex. Highly active cardiomyocytes require sufficient energy metabolism to maintain their function. Under physiological conditions, the choice of fuel is a delicate process that depends on the whole body and organs to support the normal function of heart tissues. However, disordered cardiac metabolism has been discovered to play a key role in many forms of heart diseases, including ischemic heart disease, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and cardiac injury induced by diabetes or sepsis. Regulation of cardiac metabolism has recently emerged as a novel approach to treat heart diseases. However, little is known about cardiac energy metabolic regulators. Histone deacetylases (HDACs), a class of epigenetic regulatory enzymes, are involved in the pathogenesis of heart diseases, as reported in previous studies. Notably, the effects of HDACs on cardiac energy metabolism are gradually being explored. Our knowledge in this respect would facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for heart diseases. The present review is based on the synthesis of our current knowledge concerning the role of HDAC regulation in cardiac energy metabolism in heart diseases. In addition, the role of HDACs in different models is discussed through the examples of myocardial ischemia, ischemia/reperfusion, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and diabetes- or sepsis-induced cardiac injury. Finally, we discuss the application of HDAC inhibitors in heart diseases and further prospects, thus providing insights into new treatment possibilities for different heart diseases.","['Cardiac energy metabolism', 'Cardiac hypertrophy', 'Diabetic cardiomyopathy', 'Heart failure', 'Histone deacetylases', 'Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion']",2022-12-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Mice in the ischemia/reperfusion and dexmedetomidine groups received normal saline solution and dexmedetomidine intraperitoneally, respectively. The sham group underwent the same procedure as the ischemia/reperfusion group, with the exception of tourniquet application. Subsequently, the ultrastructure of the gastrocnemius muscle was observed, and its contractile force was examined. In addition, Toll-like receptor 4 and nuclear factor-κB expression within muscles was detected by Western blot.Dexmedetomidine alleviated myocyte damage and increased the contractility of skeletal muscles. Moreover, dexmedetomidine significantly inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB in the gastrocnemius muscle.Taken together, these results demonstrate that dexmedetomidine administration attenuated tourniquet-induced structural and functional impairment of the skeletal muscle, partly through inactivation of the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB pathway.",[],2022-10-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36884028,β3AR-Dependent Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Generation Limits Chronic Postischemic Heart Failure.,"Loss of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB (tropomyosin kinase receptor B) signaling accounts for brain and cardiac disorders. In neurons, β-adrenergic receptor stimulation enhances local BDNF expression. It is unclear if this occurs in a pathophysiological relevant manner in the heart, especially in the β-adrenergic receptor-desensitized postischemic myocardium. Nor is it fully understood whether and how TrkB agonists counter chronic postischemic left ventricle (LV) decompensation, a significant unmet clinical milestone.We conducted in vitro studies using neonatal rat and adult murine cardiomyocytes, SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, and umbilical vein endothelial cells. We assessed myocardial ischemia (MI) impact in wild type, β3AR knockout, or myocyte-selective BDNF knockout (myoBDNF KO) mice in vivo (via coronary ligation [MI]) or in isolated hearts with global ischemia-reperfusion (I/R).In wild type hearts, BDNF levels rose early after MI (<24 hours), plummeting at 4 weeks when LV dysfunction, adrenergic denervation, and impaired angiogenesis ensued. The TrkB agonist, LM22A-4, countered all these adverse effects. Compared with wild type, isolated myoBDNF KO hearts displayed worse infarct size/LV dysfunction after I/R injury and modest benefits from LM22A-4. In vitro, LM22A-4 promoted neurite outgrowth and neovascularization, boosting myocyte function, effects reproduced by 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, a chemically unrelated TrkB agonist. Superfusing myocytes with the β3AR-agonist, BRL-37344, increased myocyte BDNF content, while β3AR signaling underscored BDNF generation/protection in post-MI hearts. Accordingly, the β1AR blocker, metoprolol, via upregulated β3ARs, improved chronic post-MI LV dysfunction, enriching the myocardium with BDNF.

36883479,Nitrative Modification of Caveolin-3: A Novel Mechanism of Cardiac Insulin Resistance and a Potential Therapeutic Target Against Ischemic Heart Failure in Prediabetic Animals.,"Myocardial insulin resistance is a hallmark of diabetic cardiac injury. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies demonstrate that the diabetic heart is resistant to other cardioprotective interventions, including adiponectin and preconditioning. The ""universal"" resistance to multiple therapeutic interventions suggests impairment of the requisite molecule(s) involved in broad prosurvival signaling cascades. Cav (Caveolin) is a scaffolding protein coordinating transmembrane signaling transduction. However, the role of Cav3 in diabetic impairment of cardiac protective signaling and diabetic ischemic heart failure is unknown.Wild-type and gene-manipulated mice were fed a normal diet or high-fat diet for 2 to 12 weeks and subjected to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Insulin cardioprotection was determined.Compared with the normal diet group, the cardioprotective effect of insulin was significantly blunted as early as 4 weeks of high-fat diet feeding (prediabetes), a time point where expression levels of insulin-signaling molecules remained unchanged. However, Cav3/insulin receptor-β complex formation was significantly reduced. Among multiple posttranslational modifications altering protein/protein interaction, Cav3 (not insulin receptor-β) tyrosine nitration is prominent in the prediabetic heart. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with 5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride reduced the signalsome complex and blocked insulin transmembrane signaling. Mass spectrometry identified Tyr73 as the Cav3 nitration site. Phenylalanine substitution of Tyr73 (Cav3Y73F) abolished 5-amino-3-(4-morpholinyl)-1,2,3-oxadiazolium chloride-induced Cav3 nitration, restored Cav3/insulin receptor-β complex, and rescued insulin transmembrane signaling. It is most important that adeno-associated virus 9-mediated cardiomyocyte-specific Cav3Y73F reexpression blocked high-fat diet-induced Cav3 nitration, preserved Cav3 signalsome integrity, restored transmembrane signaling, and rescued insulin-protective action against ischemic heart failure. Last, diabetic nitrative modification of Cav3 at Tyr73 also reduced Cav3/AdipoR1 complex formation and blocked adiponectin cardioprotective signaling.Nitration of Cav3 at Tyr73 and resultant signal complex dissociation results in cardiac insulin/adiponectin resistance in the prediabetic heart, contributing to ischemic heart failure progression. Early interventions preserving Cav3-centered signalsome integrity is an effective novel strategy against diabetic exacerbation of ischemic heart failure.","['caveolin 3', 'diabetes mellitus', 'protein processing, posttranslational', 'reperfusion injury']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36882763,Direct targeting of DOCK4 by miRNA-181d in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-mediated neuronal injury.,"The miRNA-181 (miR-181) family regulates neuronal persistence during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CI/RI). Since the effect of miR-181d on CI/RI has never been studied, the current work sought to determine the involvement of miR-181d in neuronal apoptosis after brain I/R injury. To replicate in vivo and in vitro CI/RI, a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model in rats and an oxygen-glucose deficiency/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in neuro 2A cells were developed. In both in vivo and in vitro stroke models, the expression of miR-181d was considerably higher. miR-181d suppression reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress in OGD/R-treated neuroblastoma cells, but miR-181d overexpression increased both. Furthermore, it was observed that miR-181d has a direct target in dedicator of cytokinesis 4 (DOCK4). The overexpression of DOCK4 partially overcame cell apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by miR-181d upregulation and OGD/R injury. Furthermore, the DOCK4 rs2074130 mutation was related to lower DOCK4 levels in ischemic stroke (IS) peripheral blood and higher susceptibility to IS. These findings suggest that downregulating miR-181d protects neurons from ischemic damage by targeting DOCK4, implying that the miR-181d/DOCK4 axis might be a novel therapeutic target for IS.","['DOCK4', 'Ischemic stroke', 'OGD/R', 'Polymorphism', 'miRNA-181d']",2022-12-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36882114,Inhibition of MicroRNA-122-5p Relieves Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury via SOCS1.," Evidence has shown that microRNA (miR)-122-5p is a diagnostic biomarker of acute myocardial infarction. Here, we aimed to uncover the functions of miR-122-5p in the pathological process of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI). An MI/RI model was established by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in mice. The levels of miR-122-5p, suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS1), phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (p-JAK2), and signal transducers and activators of transcription (p-STAT3) in the myocardial tissues of mice were measured. Downregulated miR-122-5p or upregulated SOCS1 recombinant adenovirus vectors were injected into mice before MI/RI modeling. The cardiac function, inflammatory response, myocardial infarction area, pathological damage, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the myocardial tissues of mice were evaluated. Cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury and cardiomyocyte biological function was tested upon transfection of miR-122-5p inhibitor. The target relation between miR-122-5p and SOCS1 was evaluated. miR-122-5p expression and p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expression were high, and SOCS1 expression was low in the myocardial tissues of MI/RI mice. Decreasing miR-122-5p or increasing SOCS1 expression inactivated the JAK2/STAT3 pathway to alleviate MI/RI by improving cardiac function and reducing inflammatory reaction, myocardial infarction area, pathological damage, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in mice. Silencing of SOCS1 reversed depleted miR-122-5p-induced cardioprotection for MI/RI mice. In vitro experiments revealed that the downregulation of miR-122-5p induced proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities of H/R cardiomyocytes while inhibiting apoptosis. Mechanically, SOCS1 was a target gene of miR-122-5p. Our study summarizes that inhibition of miR-122-5p induces SOCS1 expression, thereby relieving MI/RI in mice.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36881980,Dexmedetomidine attenuates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced apoptosis via reducing oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.,"Dexmedetomidine (DEX) affords a hepatoprotective effect during ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI); however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this work, using a rat liver IR model and a BRL-3A cell hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) model, we explored whether DEX protects the liver against IRI by decreasing oxidative stress (OS), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and apoptotic pathways. We found that DEX significantly increased SOD and GSH activity while decreasing ROS and MDA levels in BRL-3A cells, successfully preventing HR-induced OS damage. DEX administration reduced JNK, ERK, and P38 phosphorylation and blocked HR-induced MAPK signaling pathway activation. Additionally, DEX administration reduced the expression of GRP78, IRE1α, XBP1, TRAF2, and CHOP, which reduced HR-induced ERS. NAC prevented the MAPK pathway from being activated and inhibited the ERS pathway. Further research showed that DEX significantly reduced HR-induced apoptosis by suppressing the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. Similarly, animal studies demonstrated DEX exerted a protective effect of the liver by alleviating histopathological injury and enhancing liver function, mechanically DEX reduced cell apoptosis in liver tissue by reducing oxidative stress and ERS. In conclusion, DEX mitigates OS and ERS during IR, thereby suppressing cell apoptosis, thus providing protection to the liver.","['Apoptosis', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'Ischemia-reperfusion', 'Liver', 'Oxidative stress']",2023-01-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36881691,Cephalic electroacupuncture restores learning and memory in rats with induced ischemic stroke via inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation.,"Inflammatory responses in the brain contribute to cognitive deficits. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a critical transcription factor in inflammatory responses, is activated in post-stroke cognitive deficit. Baihui (DU20) and Shenting (DU24) acupoints, the main acupoints of Du Meridian, are widely used to improve cognitive deficits in Chinese patients with stroke. It has been reported that post-stroke cognitive deficits can be treated by electroacupuncture (EA) but the underlying mechanisms of these effects are unclear. Using the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model, we found that EA at these 2 acupoints improved neurological function, decreased cerebral infarct lesion volumes, and ameliorated the inflammatory response in the hippocampal CA1 region. The treatment also ameliorated memory and learning deficits by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway in the ischemic hippocampal CA 1 region. This coincided with downregulation of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, CD45, and tumor necrosis factor-α. We conclude that EA at these 2 acupoints ameliorates memory and learning deficits following experimental cerebral infarction by inhibiting NF-κB-mediated inflammatory injury in the hippocampal CA1 region.","['\n          Baihui (DU20) and Shenting acupoints (DU24)', 'Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'Electroacupuncture', 'Hippocampal CA1 region', 'Nuclear factor-κB']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36881363,ATPIF1 alleviates oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced astrocyte injury in vitro: A rat model of ischemic brain injury.,"The role of ATPIF1 in ischemic brain injury is rarely reported.This study explored the effect of ATPIF1 on astrocyte activity under oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R).The study sample was randomly allocated into: 1) control group (blank control); 2) OGD/R group (hypoxia for 6 h/reoxygenation for 1 h); 3) siRNA negative control (NC) group (OGD/R model+siRNA NC); and 4) siRNA-ATPIF1 group (OGD/R model+siRNA-ATPIF1). The OGD/R cell model was established from Sprague Dawley (SD) rats to simulate ischemia/reperfusion injury. Cells in the siRNA-ATPIF1 group were treated with siATPIF1. Ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Apoptosis, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected with flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), and caspase-3 were detected with western blot.In the model group, the cell structure and the ridge structure were destroyed, and mitochondria edema, outer membrane damage and vacuole-like lesions were observed. Compared with the control group, the OGD/R group had considerably increased apoptosis, G0/G1 phase, ROS content, MMP, and Bax, caspase-3 and NF-κB protein expression, as well as markedly decreased S phase and Bcl-2 protein expression. Compared with the OGD/R group, the siRNA-ATPIF1 group had considerably decreased apoptosis, G0/G1 phase, ROS content, MMP, and Bax, caspase-3 and NF-κB protein expression, as well as remarkably increased S phase and Bcl-2 protein expression.The inhibition of ATPIF1 may alleviate OGD/R-induced astrocyte injury by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibiting apoptosis, and reducing the ROS content and MMP in the rat brain ischemic model.","['ATPIF1', 'NF-κB signaling pathway', 'OGD/R', 'apoptosis', 'astrocytes']",2022-03-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36881362,"Protective effect of basic helix-loop-helix family member e40 on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury: Inhibition of apoptosis via repressing the transcription of pleckstrin homology-like domain family A, member 1.","During ischemic stroke treatment, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury results in neuronal cell death and neurological dysfunctions in brain. Previous studies indicate that basic helix-loop-helix family member e40 (BHLHE40) exerts protective effects on the pathology of neurogenic diseases. However, the protective function of BHLHE40 in I/R is unclear.This study aimed to explore the expression, role and potential mechanism of BHLHE40 after ischemia.We established models of I/R injury in rats and of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in primary hippocampal neurons. Nissl and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to detect neuronal injury and apoptosis. Immunofluorescence was used to detect BHLHE40 expression. Cell viability and cell damage measurements were conducted using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The regulation of BHLHE40 to pleckstrin homology-like domain family A, member 1 (PHLDA1) was assessed using the dual-luciferase assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay.Cerebral I/R rats exhibited severe neuronal loss and apoptosis in hippocampal cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) region, accompanied by downregulated BHLHE40 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, indicating that BHLHE40 may regulate the apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. The function of BHLHE40 in neuronal apoptosis during cerebral I/R was further explored by establishing an OGD/R model in vitro. Low expression of BHLHE40 was also observed in neurons treated with OGD/R. The OGD/R administration inhibited cell viability and enhanced cell apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, whereas BHLHE40 overexpression reversed those changes. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BHLHE40 could repress PHLDA1 transcription by binding to PHLDA1 promoter. The PHLDA1 is a facilitator of neuronal damage in brain I/R injury and its upregulation reversed the effects caused by BHLHE40 overexpression in vitro.The transcription factor BHLHE40 may protect against brain I/R injury through repressing cell damage via regulating PHLDA1 transcription. Thus, BHLHE40 may be a candidate gene for further study of molecular or therapeutic targets for I/R.","['BHLHE40', 'OGD/R', 'PHLDA1', 'apoptosis', 'cerebral I/R injury']",2022-04-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36880874,The landscape of m1A modification and its posttranscriptional regulatory functions in primary neurons.,"Cerebral ischaemia‒reperfusion injury (IRI), during which neurons undergo oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), is a notable pathological process in many neurological diseases. N1-methyladenosine (m1A) is an RNA modification that can affect gene expression and RNA stability. The m1A landscape and potential functions of m1A modification in neurons remain poorly understood. We explored RNA (mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA) m1A modification in normal and OGD/R-treated mouse neurons and the effect of m1A on diverse RNAs. We investigated the m1A landscape in primary neurons, identified m1A-modified RNAs, and found that OGD/R increased the number of m1A RNAs. m1A modification might also affect the regulatory mechanisms of noncoding RNAs, e.g., lncRNA-RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interactions and circRNA translation. We showed that m1A modification mediates the circRNA/lncRNA‒miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism and that 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) modification of mRNAs can hinder miRNA-mRNA binding. Three modification patterns were identified, and genes with different patterns had intrinsic mechanisms with potential m1A-regulatory specificity. Systematic analysis of the m1A landscape in normal and OGD/R neurons lays a critical foundation for understanding RNA modification and provides new perspectives and a theoretical basis for treating and developing drugs for OGD/R pathology-related diseases.","['OGD', 'epitranscriptomics', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'm1A modification', 'mouse', 'ncRNA', 'neuron']",2022-12-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36880629,Comparison of hyperbaric oxygen and ozone treatment for ischemia/re-perfusion injury in an experimental testicular torsion model.,"This study aims to compare the effects of medical ozone (MO) therapy and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy in an experimental testicular torsion model by measuring the oxidant and antioxidant markers and examining the histopathological tissue damage findings.Thirty-two Wistar rats are used and are divided into four groups; (1) sham group (SG), (2) only ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) by testicular torsion, (3) HBO administered group, and (4) MO administered group. No torsion was conducted in the SG. In all other groups, rats underwent testicular torsion followed by detorsion to create an I/R model. After I/R, HBO was injected in the HBO group, and in the MO group, intraperitoneal ozone was applied. At the end of 1 week, testicular tissues were obtained for biochemical analyzes and histopathological examinations. Biochemically, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured for oxidant activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were measured for antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the testicles were evaluated histopathologically.Both HBO and MO have significantly decreased MDA levels, compared with sham and I/R groups, resulting in decreased oxidation effects. The antioxidant GSH-Px levels in the HBO and MO groups were significantly higher than in the sham and I/R groups. In addition, the antioxidant SOD levels in the HBO group were significantly higher than sham, I/R, and MO groups. Therefore, the antioxidant effect of HBO was observed to be superior to MO, specifically considering SOD levels. Histopathologically, there was no significant difference between the groups (p>0.05).The study may extrapolate that both HBO and MO are antioxidant agents that can be used in testicular torsion. HBO treatment might improve the cellular antioxidant capacity due to increased antioxidant marker levels more than MO therapy. However, further studies are needed with a larger sample size.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The expression of TPM3 mRNA and protein was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting. H9c2 cells with stable TPM3-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression were constructed and treated with H/R (hypoxia for 3 hours, and reoxygenation for 4 hours). The expression of TPM3 was measured by RT-qPCR. The expressions of TPM3, pyroptosis-related proteins including caspase-1, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and Gasdermin family proteins-N (GSDMD-N) were measured by Western blotting. The expression of caspase-1 was also observed by immunofluorescence assay. The levels of human interleukins (IL-1β, IL-18) in the supernatant were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to elucidate the effect of sh-TPM3 on pyroptosis of cardiomyocytes. Rat myocardial fibroblasts were incubated with the above cell supernatant, and the expressions of human collagen I, collagen III, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor 2 (TIMP2) were detected by Western blotting to determine the effect of TPM3-interfered cardiomyocytes on the activation of fibroblasts under H/R conditions.Compared with the control group, H/R treatment for 4 hours significantly decreased the survival rate of H9c2 cells [(25.81±1.90)% vs. (99.40±5.54)%, P < 0.01], promoted the expression of TPM3 mRNA and protein [TPM3/GAPDH (2-ΔΔCt): 3.87±0.50 vs. 1, TPM3/β-Tubulin: 0.45±0.05 vs. 0.14±0.01, both P < 0.01], and promoted the expressions of caspase-1, NLRP3, GSDMD-N, and the enhanced release of cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 [cleaved caspase-1/caspase-1: 0.89±0.04 vs. 0.42±0.03, NLRP3/β-Tubulin: 0.39±0.03 vs. 0.13±0.02, GSDMD-N/β-Tubulin: 0.69±0.05 vs. 0.21±0.02, IL-1β (μg/L): 13.84±1.89 vs. 4.31±0.33, IL-18 (μg/L): 17.56±1.94 vs. 5.36±0.63, all P < 0.01].

Inflammation and autophagy play important roles in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury. The present study characterizes the effects of TLR4 activation on inflammation and autophagy in CI/R injury. An in vivo CI/R rat injury model and an in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) SH-SY5Y cell model were established.

36879554,An extensive evaluation of hepatic markers of damage and regeneration in controlled and uncontrolled donation after circulatory death.,"Livers from donations after circulatory death (DCDs) are very sensitive to ischemia/reperfusion injury and thus need careful reconditioning, such as normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). So far, its impact on DCDs has not been thoroughly investigated. This pilot cohort study aimed to explore the NRP impact on liver function by evaluating dynamic changes of circulating markers and hepatic gene expression in 9 uncontrolled DCDs (uDCDs) and 10 controlled DCDs. At NRP start, controlled DCDs had lower plasma levels of inflammatory and liver damage markers, including α-glutathione s-transferase, sorbitol-dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase 1, liver-type arginase-1, and keratin-18, but higher levels of osteopontin, sFas, flavin mononucleotide, and succinate than uDCDs. During 4-hour NRP, some damage and inflammatory markers increased in both groups, while IL-6, HGF, and osteopontin increased only in uDCDs. At the NRP end, the tissue expression of early transcriptional regulators, apoptosis, and autophagy mediators was higher in uDCDs than in controlled DCDs. In conclusion, despite initial differences in liver damage biomarkers, the uDCD group was characterized by a major gene expression of regenerative and repair factors after the NRP procedure.

We performed a comparative analysis of TNK and alteplase in patients with TLs.We first compared the treatment effect of TNK and alteplase in patients with TLs using individual patient data from the EXTEND-IA TNK trials. We evaluated intracranial reperfusion at initial angiographic assessment and 90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) with ordinal logistic and Firth regression models. Because 2 key outcomes, mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), were few in number among those who received alteplase in the EXTEND-IA TNK trials, we generated pooled estimates for these outcomes by supplementing trial data with estimates of incidence obtained through a meta-analysis of studies identified in a systematic review. We then calculated unadjusted risk differences to compare the pooled estimates for those receiving alteplase with the incidence observed in the trial among those receiving TNK.Seventy-one of 483 patients (15%) in the EXTEND-IA TNK trials possessed a TL. In patients with TLs, intracranial reperfusion was observed in 11/56 (20%) of TNK-treated patients vs 1/15 (7%) alteplase-treated patients (adjusted odds ratio 2.19; 95% CI 0.28-17.29). No significant difference in 90-day mRS was observed (adjusted common odds ratio 1.48; 95% CI 0.44-5.00). A pooled study-level proportion of alteplase-associated mortality and sICH was 0.14 (95% CI 0.08-0.21) and 0.09 (95% CI 0.04-0.16), respectively. Compared with a mortality rate of 0.09 (95% CI 0.03-0.20) and an sICH rate of 0.07 (95% CI 0.02-0.17) in TNK-treated patients, no significant difference was observed.Functional outcomes, mortality, and sICH did not significantly differ between patients with TLs treated with TNK and those treated with alteplase.This study provides Class III evidence that TNK is associated with similar rates of intracranial reperfusion, functional outcome, mortality, and sICH compared with alteplase in patients with acute stroke due to TLs. However, the CIs do not rule out clinically important differences.

36878202,Rapamycin does not act as a dietary restriction mimetic in the protection against ischemia reperfusion injury.,"Introduction Short-term fasting protects against renal ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). mTOR signaling is downregulated and may be involved in its protective effect. Rapamycin is considered a possible mimetic as it inhibits the mTOR-pathway. This study examines the effect of rapamycin on renal IRI. Methods Mice were divided in four groups : Ad libitum(AL), Fasted (F), AL treated with rapamycin (AL+R) and F treated with rapamycin (F+R). Rapamycin was administered intraperitoneally 24h before bilateral renal IRI was induced. Survival was monitored for 7 days. Renal cell death, regeneration, and mTOR activity were determined 48h after reperfusion. Oxidative stress resistance of HK-2 and PTEC cells after rapamycin treatment was determined. Results All F and F+R mice survived the experiment. Although rapamycin substantially downregulated mTOR-activity, survival in the AL+R group was similar to AL (10%). Renal regeneration was significantly reduced in AL+R but not in F+R. After IRI (48h), pS6K/S6K ratio was lower in F, F+R and AL+R groups compared to AL fed animals (p=0.02). In vitro, rapamycin also significantly downregulated mTOR-activity (p<0.001), but did not protect against oxidative stress. Conclusion Rapamycin pretreatment does not protect against renal IRI. Thus, protection against renal IRI by fasting is not exclusively mediated through inhibition of mTOR activity, but may involve preservation of regenerative mechanisms despite mTOR downregulation. Therefore, rapamycin cannot be used as a dietary mimetic to protect against renal IRI.",[],2022-09-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

During exercise, sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction is dampened in active skeletal muscle. This phenomenon, termed functional sympatholysis, plays a critical role in maintaining oxygen delivery to working skeletal muscle and may contribute to determining exercise capacity. Herein, we investigate the effects of IPC on functional sympatholysis in humans.In 20 (10 M/10F) healthy young adults, forearm blood flow (Doppler ultrasound) and beat-to-beat arterial pressure (finger photoplethysmography) were measured during lower body negative pressure (LBNP; -20 mmHg) applied at rest and simultaneously during rhythmic handgrip exercise (30% maximum contraction) before and after local IPC (4 × 5-min 220 mmHg) or sham (4 × 5-min 20 mmHg). Forearm vascular conductance (FVC) was calculated as forearm blood flow/mean arterial pressure and the magnitude of sympatholysis as the difference of LBNP-induced changes in FVC between handgrip and rest.At baseline, LBNP decreased FVC (females (F): ∆-41 ± 19%, males (M): ∆-44 ± 10%), and these responses were attenuated during handgrip (F: ∆-8 ± 9%, M: ∆-8 ± 7%). After IPC, LBNP induced similar decreases in resting FVC (F: ∆-37 ± 19%, M: ∆-44 ± 13%). However, during handgrip this response was further attenuated in males (∆-3 ± 9%, P = 0.02 vs. pre) but not females (∆-5 ± 10%, P = 0.13 vs. pre), which aligned with an IPC-mediated increase in sympatholysis (M-pre: 36 ± 10% vs. post: 40 ± 9%, P = 0.01; F-pre: 32 ± 15% vs. post: 32 ± 14%, P = 0.82). Sham IPC had no impact on any variables.These findings highlight a sex-specific effect of IPC on functional sympatholysis and provide evidence of a potential mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of IPC on human exercise performance.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36878093,Loureirin C inhibits ferroptosis after cerebral ischemia reperfusion through regulation of the Nrf2 pathway in mice.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is considered as a serious cerebral vascular disease. Ferroptosis is a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD), that closely related to the occurrence and progress of IS. Loureirin C, a type of dihydrochalcone compound derived from the Chinese Dragon's blood (CDB). The effective components extracted from CDB have shown neuroprotective effects in ischemia reperfusion models. However, the role of Loureirin C in mice after IS is not well understood. Thus, it is worth to identify the effect and mechanism of Loureirin C on IS.The present research aims to prove the existence of ferroptosis in IS and explore whether Loureirin C can inhibit ferroptosis by regulating nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in mice and exert neuroprotective effects on IS models.Middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established to evaluate the occurrence of ferroptosis and the potential Loureirin C brain-protective effect in vivo. The analysis of free iron, glutamate content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation levels, along with transmission electron microscope (TEM) was applied to prove the existence of ferroptosis. The function of Loureirin C on Nrf2 nuclear translocation was verified by immunofluorescence staining. In vitro, primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells were processed with Loureirin C after oxygen and glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD/R). ELISA kits, western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis, immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time PCR were devoted to proving the neuroprotective effects of Loureirin C on IS via regulating ferroptosis and Nrf2 pathways.The results showed that Loureirin C not only dramatically alleviated brain injury and inhibited neurons ferroptosis in mice after MCAO/R, but also dose-dependently reduce ROS accumulation in ferroptosis after OGD/R. Further, Loureirin C inhibits ferroptosis by activating Nrf2 pathway, and promoting nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Besides, Loureirin C increases heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) content after IS. Intriguingly, the anti-ferroptosis effect of Loureirin C is weakened by Nrf2 knockdown.Our discoveries first revealed that the inhibitory action of Loureirin C on ferroptosis may greatly depend on its adjusting effect on the Nrf2 pathway, suggesting that Loureirin C could act as a novel anti-ferroptosis candidate and play a therapeutic role in IS. These novel discoveries on the role of Loureirin C on IS models reveal an innovative method that may contribute to neuroprotection for the prevention of IS.","['Ferroptosis', 'Ischemic stroke (IS)', 'Loureirin C', 'Nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway', 'Reactive oxygen species (ROS)']",2022-08-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Animals were categorized into sham, ischemia-reperfusion (IR), and IR+Daidzein group. 3-hour ischemia of intestine was created by occluding superior mesenteric artery and then left for 3-hour reperfusion. In IR+daidzein group, after ischemia, 50 mg/kg daidzein was orally administered to the animals. Blood samples were collected for biochemical assays. Intestine tissues were excised for histopathologic and immunohistochemical processing.Malondialdehyde (MDA) increased, and Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione (GSH) decreased after IR in intestine tissue. Daidzein treatment decreased MDA and increased CAT and GSH level in IR+Daidzein group. Histopathologically, sham group showed normal intestinal tissue histology. In IR group, epithelial and villi degeneration, edema, leukocyte infiltration, vascular dilatation and congestion was observed. After Daidzein treatment, these pathologies were improved. The caspase-6 expression was mainly negative in sham group. After IR, caspase-6 reaction was very high in IR group. Daidzein reduced caspase-6 expression in IR+Daidzein group. Ki67 immune staining was negative in the sham group. In IR group, Ki67 expression was increased in inflammatory cells, deep glandular cells and in some goblet cell nuclei. In IR+Daidzein group, Ki67 expression was decreased due to reduced inflammation.IR injury causes oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation.

36875162,Crocetin protects cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation injury by attenuating Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission via PGC-1α.,"Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) has been traditionally used as food, spice, and medicine. Crocetin (CRT), as main bioactive component of saffron, has accumulated pieces of beneficial evidence on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the mechanisms are poorly explored. This study aims to investigate the effects of CRT on H9c2 cells under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) and elucidated the possible underlying mechanism.H/R attack was performed on H9c2 cells. Cell counting kit-8 was used to detect the cell viability. Cell samples and culture supernatants were evaluated via commercial kits to measure the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Various fluorescent probes were used to detect cell apoptosis, intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. Proteins were evaluated via Western Blot.H/R exposure severely reduced cell viability and increased LDH leakage. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) suppression and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) activation were coincided with excessive mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) collapse in H9c2 cells treated with H/R. Mitochondria fragmentation under H/R injury induced ROS over-production, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. Notably, CRT treatment significantly prevented mitochondrial fission, mPTP opening, MMP loss, and cell apoptosis. Moreover, CRT sufficiently activated PGC-1α and inactivated Drp1. Interestingly, mitochondrial fission inhibition with mdivi-1 similarly suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. However, silencing PGC-1α with small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the beneficial effects of CRT on H9c2 cells under H/R injury, accompanied with increased Drp1 and p-Drp1ser616 levels. Furthermore, over-expression of PGC-1α with adenovirus transfection replicated the beneficial effects of CRT on H9c2 cells.Our study identified PGC-1α as a master regulator in H/R-injured H9c2 cells via Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. We also presented the evidence that PGC-1α might be a novel target against cardiomyocyte H/R injury. Our data revealed the role of CRT in regulating PGC-1α/Drp1/mitochondrial fission process in H9c2 cells under the burden of H/R attack, and we suggested that modulation of PGC-1α level may provide a therapeutic target for treating cardiac I/R injury.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cerebral ischemia induced by left common carotid artery occlusion (LCCAO) for 75 min (on day 29) followed by reperfusion for 12 h. Rats (n = 48) divided into four groups. GroupI (control,Untreated + LCCAO)-No pre-treatment + cerebral ischemia; GroupII(β-sitosterol + Sham)-pre-treatment with β-sitosterol, 10 mg/kg/day + sham-operated; GroupIII(β-sitosterol + LCCAO)-pre-treatment with β-sitosterol, 10 mg/kg/day + cerebral ischemia; GroupIV(methanol extract + LCCAO)-pre-treatment with methanol extract of M. pruriens seeds, 50 mg/kg/day + cerebral ischemia. Neurological deficit score was assessed just before sacrifice. Experimental animals were sacrificed after 12 h reperfusion. Brain histopathology was performed. Gene expression of NMDAR and Tau protein of left cerebral hemisphere (occluded side) was performed by RT-PCR. Results revealed that the neurological deficit score was lower in groups III and IV compared to group I. NMDAR and tau protein mRNA expression in left cerebral hemisphere were upregulated in Group I, downregulated in groups III and IV. Histopathology of left cerebral hemisphere (occluded side) in Group I showed features of ischemic brain damage. Groups III and IV, left cerebral hemisphere showed less ischemic damage compared GroupI. Right cerebral hemisphere showed no areas of ischemia-induced brain changes.

36873773,Enriched environment promotes post-stroke angiogenesis through astrocytic interleukin-17A.,"Our previous studies have revealed that the protective effect of an enriched environment (EE) may be linked with astrocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. However, the relationship between astrocytes and angiogenesis under EE conditions still requires further study. The current research examined the neuroprotective effects of EE on angiogenesis in an astrocytic interleukin-17A (IL-17A)-dependent manner following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.A rat model of ischemic stroke based on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 120 min followed by reperfusion was established, after which rats were housed in either EE or standard conditions. A set of behavior tests were conducted, including the modified neurological severity scores (mNSS) and the rotarod test. The infarct volume was evaluated by means of 2,3,5-Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. To evaluate the levels of angiogenesis, the protein levels of CD34 were examined by means of immunofluorescence and western blotting, while the protein and mRNA levels of IL-17A, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the angiogenesis-associated factors interleukin-6 (IL-6), JAK2, and STAT3 were detected by western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).We found that EE promoted functional recovery, reduced infarct volume, and enhanced angiogenesis compared to rats in standard conditions. IL-17A expression in astrocytes was also increased in EE rats. EE treatment increased the levels of microvascular density (MVD) and promoted the expression of CD34, VEGF, IL-6, JAK2, and STAT3 in the penumbra, while the intracerebroventricular injection of the IL-17A-neutralizing antibody in EE rats attenuated EE-mediated functional recovery and angiogenesis.Our findings revealed a possible neuroprotective mechanism of astrocytic IL-17A in EE-mediated angiogenesis and functional recovery after I/R injury, which might provide the theoretical basis for EE in clinical practise for stroke patients and open up new ideas for the research on the neural repair mechanism mediated by IL-17A in the recovery phase of stroke.","['IL-17A', 'angiogenesis', 'astrocyte', 'cerebral ischemia/reperfusion', 'enriched environment']",2022-11-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, postoperative infarct volume, the 90-day good prognosis rate (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤ 2 points), and the mortality rate of the two groups were compared and analyzed. Blood specimens were collected from patients before and after treatment. Serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) were measured.The 7-day postoperative cerebral infarct volume [(63.7 ± 22.1) ml vs. (88.5 ± 20.8) ml] and NIHSS scores at postoperative Days 1, 7, and 14 [(6.8 ± 3.8) points vs. (8.2 ± 3.5) points; (2.6 ± 1.6) points vs. (4.0 ± 1.8) points; (2.0 ± 1.2) points vs. (3.5 ± 2.1) points] in the test group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The good prognosis rate at 90 days postoperatively (54.9 vs. 35.2%, P = 0.018) was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group. The 90-day mortality rate was not statistically significant (7.0 vs. 8.5%, P = 0.754). Immediately after surgery and 1 day after surgery, SOD, IL-10, and RBM3 levels in the test group were relatively higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant. Immediately after surgery and 1 day after surgery, MDA and IL-6 levels in the test group were relatively reduced compared with those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). In the test group, RBM3 was positively correlated with SOD and IL-10.Mechanical thrombectomy combined with intraarterial cold saline perfusion is a safe and effective measure for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction. Postoperative NIHSS scores and infarct volumes were significantly improved with this strategy compared with simple mechanical thrombectomy, and the 90-day good prognosis rate was improved. The mechanism by which this treatment exerts its cerebral protective effect may be by inhibiting the transformation of the ischaemic penumbra of the infarct core area, scavenging some oxygen free radicals, reducing inflammatory injury to cells after acute infarction and ischaemia-reperfusion, and promoting RBM3 production in cells.","['controlled studies', 'endovascular therapy', 'hypothermia', 'infarction', 'inflammatory response', 'oxidative stress']",2022-09-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has the multi-component, multi-channel, and multi-target advantages in the treatment of MIRI, which offers new ideas in this aspect. TCM containing flavonoids has a variety of biological activities and plays a significant role in the treatment of MIRI, which has great research and development application value.

One hour after the last administration, the MI/RI rat model was established by ligating the left anterior descending artery(LAD) for 30 min ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion except the sham group. The sham group underwent the same procedures without LAD ligation. Heart function, cardiac infarct size, cardiac patho-logy, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac injury enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines were determined to assess the protective effects of CRFG and CCFG against MI/RI. The gene expression levels of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain protein 3(NLRP3) inflammasome, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD(ASC), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-1(caspase-1), Gasdermin-D(GSDMD), interleukin-1β(IL-1β), and interleukin-18(IL-18) were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). The protein expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, and N-GSDMD were determined by Western blot. The results showed that both CRFG and CCFG pretreatments significantly improved cardiac function, decreased the cardiac infarct size, inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and reduced the content of lactic dehydrogenase(LDH), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme(CK-MB), aspartate transaminase(AST), and cardiac troponin Ⅰ(cTnⅠ). In addition, CRFG and CCFG pretreatments significantly decreased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) in serum. RT-PCR results showed that CRFG and CCFG pretreatment down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, and downstream pyroptosis-related effector substances including GSDMD, IL-18, and IL-1β in cardiac tissues. Western blot revealed that CRFG and CCFG pretreatments significantly decreased the protein expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, GSDMD, and N-GSDMD in cardiac tissues. In conclusion, CRFG and CCFG pretreatments have obvious cardioprotective effects on MI/RI in rats, and the under-lying mechanism may be related to the inhibition of NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway to reduce the cardiac inflammatory response.","['Cinnamomi Cortex formula granules', 'Cinnamomi Ramulus formula granules', 'NLRP3 inflammasome', 'NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD pathway', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury(MI/RI)', 'pyroptosis', 'warming and coordinating the heart Yang']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36871980,Stigmasterol protects human brain microvessel endothelial cells against ischemia-reperfusion injury through suppressing EPHA2 phosphorylation.,"Stigmasterol is a plant sterol with anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effect through multiple mechanisms. In this study, we further assessed whether it exerts protective effect on human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMECs) against ischemia-reperfusion injury and explored the underlying mechanisms. HBMECs were used to establish an in vitro oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model, while a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats were constructed. The interaction between stigmasterol and EPHA2 was detected by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). The results showed that 10 μmol·L-1 stigmasterol significantly protected cell viability, alleviated the loss of tight junction proteins and attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage induced by OGD/R in thein vitro model. Subsequent molecular docking showed that stigmasterol might interact with EPHA2 at multiple sites, including T692, a critical gatekeep residue of this receptor. Exogenous ephrin-A1 (an EPHA2 ligand) exacerbated OGD/R-induced EPHA2 phosphorylation at S897, facilitated ZO-1/claudin-5 loss, and promoted BBB leakage in vitro, which were significantly attenuated after stigmasterol treatment. The rat MCAO model confirmed these protective effects in vivo. In summary, these findings suggest that stigmasterol protects HBMECs against ischemia-reperfusion injury by maintaining cell viability, reducing the loss of tight junction proteins, and attenuating the BBB damage. These protective effects are at least meditated by its interaction with EPHA2 and inhibitory effect on EPHA2 phosphorylation.","['Blood-brain barrier', 'EPHA2', 'Oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion', 'Stigmasterol']",2022-09-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36871951,The Effect of Antioxidant Astaxanthin on Intestinal Ischemia Reperfusion Damage in Rats.,"Mesenteric ischemia is a frequently encountered disease in surgical clinics, difficult to diagnose, and very mortal if not treated. Our study investigated the effects of astaxanthin, which is known to have potent antioxidant properties and is also known to have anti-inflammatory effects on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.A total of 32 healthy Wistar albino female rats were used in our study. Subjects were randomized and equally divided into 4 groups; control (laparotomy group only), I/R (transient mesenteric ischemia group only), astaxanthin 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses. The transient ischemia time was 60 minutes and the reperfusion time was 120 minutes. Tissue samples were taken from intracardiac blood and terminal ileum after reperfusion. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) from blood samples, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), Caspase-3, P53 tests from terminal ileum were studied. Tissue samples were also taken for histopathological evaluation.At the end of the study, both doses of astaxanthin were found to significantly reduce MDA level, CAT, and SOD enzymatic activity, whereas higher doses of astaxanthin significantly reduced MDA level, CAT, and SOD enzyme activities. In addition, cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1 and IL-6 were found to be reduced at both doses of astaxanthin, but only significantly inhibited at higher doses. We observed that inhibition of apoptosis reduced caspase-3 activity and P53 and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation.Astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory, significantly reduces ischemia and reperfusion injury, especially when used at a dose of 10 mg/kg. These data need to be confirmed by larger animal series and clinical studies.","['Intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury', 'antioxidant effect', 'astaxanthin', 'carotenoid']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36871353,"3,4-benzopyrene aggravates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury-induced pyroptosis through inhibition of autophagy-dependent NLRP3 degradation.","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are produced during combustion of organic matter, such as during cigarette smoking, and they exist widely in the environment. Exposure to 3,4-benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), as the most widely studied PAHs, relates to many cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying mechanism of its involvement remains largely unclear. In this study, we developed a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury mouse model and an oxygen and glucose deprivation-reoxygenation H9C2 cell model to evaluate the effect of BaP in I/R injury. After BaP exposure, the expression of autophagy-related proteins, the abundance of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and the degree of pyroptosis were measured. Our results show that BaP aggravates myocardial pyroptosis in a autophagy-dependent manner. In addition, we found that BaP activates the p53-BNIP3 pathway via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to decrease autophagosome clearance. Our findings present new insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiotoxicity and reveal that the p53-BNIP3 pathway, which is involved in autophagy regulation, is a potential therapeutic target for BaP-induced myocardial I/R injury. Because PAHs are omnipresent in daily life, the toxic effects of these harmful substances should not be underestimated.","['3', '4-Benzopyrene', 'Autophagy', 'Myocardial ischemia–reperfusion', 'Pyroptosis']",2022-08-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36871262,[Machine perfusion in kidney transplantation].,"The field of organ transplantation has been facing the problem of organ shortage for several years. It is even more crucial since the number of patients on the waiting list is growing steadily. There have been numerous approaches to resolve the issue: on the one hand, extending the donation criteria and, on the other hand, improving organ preservation using machine perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies have already proven that machine perfusion decreases the incidence of delayed graft function and improves graft survival, which is particularly significant in extended criteria donation. Machine perfusion is used widely in kidney transplantation. The most frequently used method is hypothermic machine perfusion but the normothermic method is gaining more attention as well. Depending on the temperature set, machine perfusion may not only be used for organ preservation but also for organ conditioning. There is still ongoing research in the field of therapeutic approaches during machine perfusion, which may play an important role in decreasing ischaemia-reperfusion injury and immunogenicity in grafts. After a brief description of extended criteria donation, our review aims to summarize the methods and the latest results of machine perfusion, including diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the field of kidney transplantation. Orv Hetil. 2023; 164(9): 339-347.A szervtranszplantáció területén évek óta fennálló probléma az egyre növekvő szervigény mellett az elérhető donorszervek számának stagnálása. Az ellentét feloldására tett kísérletek több irányból közelítették meg a kérdést: egyrészről a donorkritériumok kiterjesztésével, másrészt az eltávolított szervek minőségének megőrzésére kidolgozott gépi perfúzió módszerével, melynek használata bizonyítottan csökkenti a késve meginduló graftműködés előfordulását, és javítja a grafttúlélést. Ezek az előnyök különösen a kiterjesztett kritériumú donáció tekintetében kifejezettek. A vesetranszplantáció során egyre szélesebb körben alkalmazzák a gépi perfúziót; jelenleg a legelterjedtebb formája a hypothermiás gépi perfúzió, azonban egyre több érv szól a normothermiás eljárás mellett is. Az alkalmazott modalitástól függően nemcsak szervkonzerválásra, de szervkondicionálásra is van lehetőség. Napjainkban számos kutatás folyik a gépi perfúzió során alkalmazható terápiás lehetőségekről, melyek a jövőben fontos szerepet játszhatnak az ischaemia-reperfúziós károsodás és az immunizáció csökkentésében. Közleményünkben a kiterjesztett kritériumú donáció rövid áttekintését követően összefoglaljuk a gépi perfúzió alkalmazási módjait, aktuális eredményeit, valamint diagnosztikus és terápiás lehetőségeit a vesetranszplantáció területén.

36870574,Mitoglitazone ameliorates renal ischemia/reperfusion injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via targeting mitoNEET.,"Ischemia/reperfusion- (I/R-) induced injury is unavoidable and a major risk factor for graft failure and acute rejection following kidney transplantation. However, few effective interventions are available to improve the outcome due to the complicated mechanisms and lack of appropriate therapeutic targets. Hence, this research aimed to explore the effect of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) compounds on I/R-induced kidney damage. One of the main causes of renal I/R injury is the ferroptosis of renal tubular cells. In this study, compared with the antidiabetic TZD pioglitazone (PGZ), we found its derivative mitoglitazone (MGZ) exerted significantly inhibitory effects on erastin-induced ferroptosis by suppressing mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization and lipid ROS production in HEK293 cells. Moreover, MGZ pretreatment remarkably alleviated I/R-induced renal damages by inhibiting cell death and inflammation, upregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and reducing iron-related lipid peroxidation in C57BL/6 N mice. Additionally, MGZ exhibited excellent protection against I/R-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by restoring ATP production, mitochondrial DNA copy numbers, and mitochondrial morphology in kidney tissues. Mechanistically, molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated that MGZ exhibited a high binding affinity with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein mitoNEET. Collectively, our findings indicated the renal protective effect of MGZ was closely linked to regulating the mitoNEET-mediated ferroptosis pathway, thus offering potential therapeutic strategies for ameliorating I/R injuries.","['Ferroptosis', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Mitoglitazone', 'Thiazolidinedione', 'mitoNEET']",2022-11-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36870389,Early allograft dysfunction in a pediatric liver allograft with an occult pathogenic mutation in the urea cycle.,"Liver transplantation risks transferring a genetic defect in metabolic pathways, including the urea cycle. We present a case of pediatric liver transplantation complicated by metabolic crisis and early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in a previously healthy unrelated deceased donor. Allograft function improved with supportive care, and retransplantation was avoided. Because hyperammonemia suggested an enzymatic defect in the allograft, genetic testing from donor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid revealed a heterozygous mutation in the ASL gene, which encodes the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate lyase. Homozygous ASL mutations precipitate metabolic crises during fasting or postoperative states, whereas heterozygous carriers retain sufficient enzyme activity and are asymptomatic. In the described case, postoperative ischemia/reperfusion injury created a metabolic demand that exceeded the enzymatic capacity of the allograft. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an acquired argininosuccinate lyase deficiency by liver transplantation and underscores the importance of considering occult metabolic variants in the allograft during EAD.","['early allograft dysfunction', 'pediatric liver transplantation', 'urea cycle defect']",2022-11-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36870018,Lactate dehydrogenase A mediated histone lactylation induced the pyroptosis through targeting HMGB1.,"Cerebral ischemia (CI), as the cerebrovascular disease with the highest incidence rate, is treated by limited intravenous thrombolysis and intravascular therapy to recanalize the embolized vessels. Recently, the discovery of histone lactylation proposes a potential molecular mechanism for the role of lactate in physiological and pathological processes. This study aimed to analyze the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) mediated histone lactylation in CI reperfusion (CI/R) injury. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treated N2a cells and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) treated rats was used as the CI/R model in vivo and in vitro. Cell viability and pyroptosis was assessed using CCK-8 and flow cytometry. RT-qPCR was performed to detect the relative expression. The relationship between histone lactylation and HMGB1 was verified by CHIP assay. LDHA, HMGB1, lactate and histone lactylation was up-regulated in the OGD/R treated N2a cells. Additionally, LDHA knockdown decreased HMGB1 levels in vitro, and relieved CI/R injury in vivo. Besides, LDHA silencing declined the histone lactylation mark enrichment on HMGB1 promoter, and lactate supplement rescued it. What?s more, LDHA knockdown decreased the IL-18 and IL-1β contents, and the cleaved-caspase-1 and GSDMD-N protein levels in the OGD/R treated N2a cells, which was reversed by HMGB1 overexpression. Knockdown of LDHA suppressed the pyroptosis in the N2a cells induced by OGD/R, which was reversed by HMGB1 overexpression. Mechanistically, LDHA mediated the histone lactylation induced pyroptosis through targeting HMGB1 in the CI/R injury.","['Cerebral ischemia injury', 'HMGB1', 'Histone lactylation', 'LDHA']",2023-02-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Thus, this single-center retrospective study aimed to investigate the association between levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecular-1 (KIM-1), liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) in DGF associated with acute kidney injury in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 3 years post-transplant. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 102 KTRs [14(13.7%) of DGF and 88(86.3%) of NON-DGF] were enrolled. DGF was defined as ""dialysis is needed within 1 week after kidney transplantation"". NGAL, KIM-1, L-FABP, and IL-18 were obtained from perfusate samples of donation-after-cardiac-death (DCD) kidneys, and measured by ELISA. RESULTS Compared to the NON-DGF group, KTRs in the DGF group had a statistically significant increase in levels of NGAL (P<0.001) and KIM-1 (P<0.001). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that NGAL (OR=1.204, 95% CI 1.057-1.372, P=0.005) and KIM-1 (OR=1.248, CI=1.065-1.463, P=0.006) could be regarded as independent risk factors. The accuracy of NGAL and KIM-1 was 83.3% and 82.1%, respectively, calculated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Furthermore, the eGFR at 3 years post-transplant had a moderate negative correlation with NGAL (r=-0.208, P=0.036) and KIM-1 (r=-0.260, P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS Our results support those from previous studies showing that perfusate levels of NGAL and KIM-1 are associated with DGF in KTRs and also with reduced eGFR at 3 years post-transplant.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36869341,Recent advances of CREKA peptide-based nanoplatforms in biomedical applications.,"Nanomedicine technology is a rapidly developing field of research and application that uses nanoparticles as a platform to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Nanoparticles loaded with drugs and imaging contrast agents have already been used in clinically, but they are essentially passive delivery carriers. To make nanoparticles smarter, an important function is the ability to actively locate target tissues. It enables nanoparticles to accumulate in target tissues at higher concentrations, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects. Among the different ligands, the CREKA peptide (Cys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Ala) is a desirable targeting ligand and has a good targeting ability for overexpressed fibrin in different models, such as cancers, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, and atherosclerosis.

36869030,Polynucleotide phosphorylase protects against renal tubular injury via blocking mt-dsRNA-PKR-eIF2α axis.,"Renal tubular atrophy is a hallmark of chronic kidney disease. The cause of tubular atrophy, however, remains elusive. Here we report that reduction of renal tubular cell polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPT1) causes renal tubular translation arrest and atrophy. Analysis of tubular atrophic tissues from renal dysfunction patients and male mice with ischemia-reperfusion injuries (IRI) or unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) treatment shows that renal tubular PNPT1 is markedly downregulated under atrophic conditions. PNPT1 reduction leads to leakage of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA (mt-dsRNA) into the cytoplasm where it activates protein kinase R (PKR), followed by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and protein translational termination. Increasing renal PNPT1 expression or inhibiting PKR activity largely rescues IRI- or UUO-induced mouse renal tubular injury. Moreover, tubular-specific PNPT1-knockout mice display Fanconi syndrome-like phenotypes with impaired reabsorption and significant renal tubular injury. Our results reveal that PNPT1 protects renal tubules by blocking the mt-dsRNA-PKR-eIF2α axis.",[],2022-08-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This study investigated the beneficial effects of thiorphan (TH)/irbesartan (IRB), in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, compared to each of nitroglycerin and carvedilol. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (10 rats/group): Sham, untreated I/R, TH/IRB + IR (0.1/10 mg/kg), nitroglycerin + IR (0.2 mg/kg), and carvedilol + IR (10 mg/kg). Mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac functions and arrhythmia incidence, duration and score were assessed. Cardiac levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), oxidative stress, endothelin-1, ATP, Na+ /K+ ATPase pump activity and mitochondria complexes activities were measured. Histopathological examination, Bcl/Bax immunohistochemistry studies and electron microscopy examination of left ventricle were performed. TH/IRB preserved the cardiac functions and mitochondrial complexes activities, mitigated cardiac damage, reduced oxidative stress and arrhythmia severity, improved the histopathological changes and decreased cardiac apoptosis. TH/IRB showed a comparable effect to each of nitroglycerin and carvedilol in alleviating the IR injury consequences. TH/IRB showed significant preservation of mitochondrial complexes activity I and II compared to nitroglycerin. TH/IRB significantly increased LVdP/dtmax and decreased oxidative stress, cardiac damage and endothelin-1 along with increasing the ATP content, Na+ /K+ ATPase pump activity and mitochondrial complexes activity when compared to carvedilol. TH/IRB showed a cardioprotective effect in reducing IR injury that is comparable to each of nitroglycerin and carvedilol that could be explained in part by its ability to preserve mitochondrial function, increase ATP, decrease oxidative stress as well as endothelin 1.","['angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor', 'carvedilol', 'ischemic reperfusion injury', 'mitochondria', 'nitroglycerin']",2022-12-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Rats' neurological functions were assessed using Longa scoring after 24 h of reperfusion, after which they were sacrificed, and cerebral infarction area was determined by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Pathological changes in damaged portions were assessed using hematoxylin-eosin and Nissl staining, and cell apoptosis was detected by terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining. Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-18 (IL-18), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in brain tissues were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed using a ROS assay kit. Protein levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β were determined by western blot.Neurological function scores, cerebral infarction areas, and neuronal apoptosis index were decreased in the Sevo and MCC950 groups than in the I/R group. IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β levels decreased in the Sevo and MCC950 groups (p < 0.05). ROS and MDA levels increased, but SOD levels increased in the Sevo and MCC950 groups than in the I/R group.

36867699,Knockdown of deleterious miRNA in progenitor cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhances tissue repair in myocardial infarction.,"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play a critical role in cardiac cell therapy by delivering molecular cargo and mediating cellular signaling. Among sEV cargo molecule types, microRNA (miRNA) is particularly potent and highly heterogeneous. However, not all miRNAs in sEV are beneficial. Two previous studies using computational modeling identified miR-192-5p and miR-432-5p as potentially deleterious in cardiac function and repair. Here, we show that knocking down miR-192-5p and miR-432-5p in cardiac c-kit+ cell (CPC)-derived sEVs enhances the therapeutic capabilities of sEVs in vitro and in a rat in vivo model of cardiac ischemia reperfusion. miR-192-5p- and miR-432-5p-depleted CPC-sEVs enhance cardiac function by reducing fibrosis and necrotic inflammatory responses. miR-192-5p-depleted CPC-sEVs also enhance mesenchymal stromal cell-like cell mobilization.

36867343,Re-Exploring the Inflammation-Related Core Genes and Modules in Cerebral Ischemia.,"The genetic transcription profile of brain ischemic and reperfusion injury remains elusive. To address this, we used an integrative analysis approach including differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis, weighted-gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and pathway and biological process analysis to analyze data from the microarray studies of nine mice and five rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and six primary cell transcriptional datasets in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). (1) We identified 58 upregulated DEGs with more than 2-fold increase, and adj. p < 0.05 in mouse datasets. Among them, Atf3, Timp1, Cd14, Lgals3, Hmox1, Ccl2, Emp1, Ch25h, Hspb1, Adamts1, Cd44, Icam1, Anxa2, Rgs1, and Vim showed significant increases in both mouse and rat datasets. (2) Ischemic treatment and reperfusion time were the main confounding factors in gene profile changes, while sampling site and ischemic time were not. (3) WGCNA identified a reperfusion-time irrelevant and inflammation-related module and a reperfusion-time relevant and thrombo-inflammation related module. Astrocytes and microglia were the main contributors of the gene changes in these two modules. (4) Forty-four module core hub genes were identified. We validated the expression of unreported stroke-associated core hubs or human stroke-associated core hubs. Zfp36 mRNA was upregulated in permanent MCAO; Rhoj, Nfkbiz, Ms4a6d, Serpina3n, Adamts-1, Lgals3, and Spp1 mRNAs were upregulated in both transient MCAO and permanent MCAO; and NFKBIZ, ZFP3636, and MAFF proteins, unreported core hubs implicated in negative regulation of inflammation, were upregulated in permanent MCAO, but not in transient MCAO.

36867283,Investigating the effects of microstructural changes induced by myocardial infarction on the elastic parameters of the heart.,"Within this work, we investigate how physiologically observed microstructural changes induced by myocardial infarction impact the elastic parameters of the heart. We use the LMRP model for poroelastic composites (Miller and Penta in Contin Mech Thermodyn 32:1533-1557, 2020) to describe the microstructure of the myocardium and investigate microstructural changes such as loss of myocyte volume and increased matrix fibrosis as well as increased myocyte volume fraction in the areas surrounding the infarct. We also consider a 3D framework to model the myocardium microstructure with the addition of the intercalated disks, which provide the connections between adjacent myocytes. The results of our simulations agree with the physiological observations that can be made post-infarction. That is, the infarcted heart is much stiffer than the healthy heart but with reperfusion of the tissue it begins to soften. We also observe that with the increase in myocyte volume of the non-damaged myocytes the myocardium also begins to soften. With a measurable stiffness parameter the results of our model simulations could predict the range of porosity (reperfusion) that could help return the heart to the healthy stiffness. It would also be possible to predict the volume of the myocytes in the area surrounding the infarct from the overall stiffness measurements.","['Asymptotic homogenization', 'Computational modelling', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Poroelasticity']",2022-05-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36867229,High-fat diet-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with loss of protection from ischemic preconditioning in renal ischemia reperfusion.,"Consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and the latter act as a critical factor in determining the severity of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in different cell types. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC), a well-known protocol that render IR protection in kidney works via mitochondria. In the present study, we evaluated how HFD kidney with underlying mitochondrial changes respond to precondition protocol after IR induction. Wistar male rats were used in this study and were divided into two groups: SD (standard diet; n = 18) and HFD (high-fat diet; n = 18), which were further subdivided into sham, ischemia-reperfusion, and precondition groups at the end of the dietary regimen. Blood biochemistry, renal injury marker, creatinine clearance (CrCl), mitochondrial quality (fission, fusion, and phagy), mitochondrial function via ETC enzyme activities and respiration, and signalling pathway were analysed. Sixteen weeks of HFD administration to the rat deteriorated the renal mitochondrial health measured via 10% decline in mitochondrial respiration index ADP/O (in GM), reduced mitochondrial copy number (55%), biogenesis (56%), low bioenergetics potential (19% complex I + III and 15% complex II + III), increased oxidative stress, and reduced expression of mitochondrial fusion genes compared with SD rats. IR procedure in HFD rat kidney inflicted significant mitochondrial dysfunction and further deteriorated copy number along with impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. IPC could effectively ameliorate the renal ischemia injury in normal rat but failed to provide similar kind of protection in HFD rat kidney. Even though the IR-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in both normal and HFD rats were similar, the magnitude of overall dysfunction and corresponding renal injury and compromised physiology was high in HFD rats. This observation was further confirmed via in vitro protein translation assay in isolated mitochondria from normal and HFD rat kidney that showed significantly reduction in the response ability of mitochondria in HFD. In conclusion, the deteriorated mitochondrial function and its quality along with low mitochondrial copy number and downregulation of mitochondrial dynamic gene exhibited by HFD rat kidney augments the sensitivity of renal tissue towards the IR injury which leads to the compromised protective ability by ischemic preconditioning.","['Bioenergetics', 'High-fat diet', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial dynamics', 'Mitophagy', 'Renal ischemia reperfusion injury']",2022-11-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and its mimetic peptide have been previously reported to exhibit potent neuroprotective properties in various central nervous system disease models. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the possible role of the ApoE mimetic peptide COG1410 in cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury and its potential underlying mechanism. Male SD rats were subjected to 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 22 h reperfusion. Evans blue leakage and IgG extravasation assays results revealed that COG1410 treatment significantly reduced BBB permeability. In addition, in situ zymography and western blotting were used to prove that COG1410 was able to downregulate the activities of MMPs and upregulate the expression of occludin in the ischemic brain tissue samples. Subsequently, COG1410 was found to significantly reverse microglia activation while also suppressing inflammatory cytokine production, according to immunofluorescence signal of Iba‑1 and CD68 and protein expression of COX‑2. Consequently, this neuroprotective mechanism mediated by COG1410 was further tested using the BV2 cell line in vitro, which was exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation. The mechanism of COG1410 was found to be mediated, as least partly, through the activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2. In conclusion, the data suggest that COG1410 can alleviate BBB injury and neuroinflammation following ischemic stroke.","['COG1410', 'blood‑brain barrier', 'cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury', 'ischemic stroke', 'neuroinflammation', 'triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865547,Exosome-derived CIRP: An amplifier of inflammatory diseases.,"Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) is an intracellular stress-response protein and a type of damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that responds to various stress stimulus by altering its expression and mRNA stability. Upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light or low temperature, CIRP get translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through methylation modification and stored in stress granules (SG). During exosome biogenesis, which involves formation of endosomes from the cell membrane through endocytosis, CIRP also gets packaged within the endosomes along with DNA, and RNA and other proteins. Subsequently, intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) are formed following the inward budding of the endosomal membrane, turning the endosomes into multi-vesicle bodies (MVBs). Finally, the MVBs fuse with the cell membrane to form exosomes. As a result, CIRP can also be secreted out of cells through the lysosomal pathway as Extracellular CIRP (eCIRP). Extracellular CIRP (eCIRP) is implicated in various conditions, including sepsis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, lung injury, and neuroinflammation, through the release of exosomes. In addition, CIRP interacts with TLR4, TREM-1, and IL-6R, and therefore are involved in triggering immune and inflammatory responses. Accordingly, eCIRP has been studied as potential novel targets for disease therapy. C23 and M3, polypeptides that oppose eCIRP binding to its receptors, are beneficial in numerous inflammatory illnesses. Some natural molecules such as Luteolin and Emodin can also antagonize CIRP, which play roles similar to C23 in inflammatory responses and inhibit macrophage-mediated inflammation. This review aims to provide a better understanding on CIRP translocation and secretion from the nucleus to the extracellular space and the mechanisms and inhibitory roles of eCIRP in diverse inflammatory illnesses.","['cold-inducible RNA-binding protein', 'exosome', 'immune response', 'inflammation', 'targeted therapy']",2022-10-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865453,Nuciferine improves cardiac function in mice subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by upregulating PPAR-γ.,"Ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction contribute to the leading cause of death in worldwide. The prevention and management of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is an essential part of coronary heart disease surgery and is becoming a major clinical problem in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Nuciferine has potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidative stress effects, but its role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is unclear. In this study, we found that nuciferine could reduce the myocardial infarct size in a mouse myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model and improve cardiac function. Furthermore, nuciferine could effectively inhibit hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R) stimulated apoptosis of primary mouse cardiomyocytes. In addition, nuciferine significantly reduced the level of oxidative stress. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) inhibitor GW9662 could reverse the protective effect of nuciferine on cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that nuciferine can inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by upregulating PPAR-γ and reducing the I/R-induced myocardial injury in mice.","['Cardiomyocytes', 'Ischemia/reperfusion', 'Nuciferine', 'PPAR-γ']",2022-09-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865346,Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 Protects the Kidney from Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Suppressing the IκBα/NF-κB/IL-17C Pathway.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an important cause of delayed functional recovery after transplantation. This study is aimed at investigating the molecular mechanism of ALDH2 in a kidney ischemia-reperfusion model based on RNA-seq.We performed kidney ischemia-reperfusion in ALDH2-/- and WT mice and evaluated kidney function and morphology using SCr, HE staining, TUNEL staining, and TEM. We used RNA-seq to compare mRNA expression in ALDH2-/- and WT mice after IR, and then, we verified the related molecular pathways by PCR and western blotting. In addition, activators and inhibitors of ALDH2 were used to alter the activity of ALDH2. Finally, we established a model of hypoxia and reoxygenation in HK-2 cells and clarified the role of ALDH2 in IR by interfering with ALDH2 and using an NF-κB inhibitor.After kidney ischemia-reperfusion, the SCr value increased significantly, kidney tubular epithelial cells were damaged, and the apoptosis rate increased. In the microstructure, mitochondria were swollen and deformed, and ALDH2 deficiency aggravated these changes. The NF-κB pathway and IL-17 pathway were significantly enriched in ALDH2-/- mice compared with WT mice according to KEGG enrichment analysis of the RNA-seq data. The PCR results showed that the mRNA expression levels of IκBα and IL-17B, C, D, E, and F were significantly higher than those in the WT-IR group. Western blot verification results showed that ALHD2 knockdown resulted in increased phosphorylation of IκBα, increased phosphorylation of NF-κB, and increased expression of IL-17C. When we used ALDH2 agonists, the number of lesions and the expression levels of the corresponding proteins were reduced. Knockdown of ALDH2 in HK-2 cells resulted in a higher proportion of apoptotic cells after hypoxia and reoxygenation, but inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-κB prevented the increase in apoptosis and reduced the protein expression level of IL-17C.ALDH2 deficiency can lead to the aggravation of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury. RNA-seq analysis and validation by PCR and western blotting revealed that this effect may be due to the promotion of IκBα/NF-κB p65 phosphorylation during ischemia-reperfusion caused by ALDH2 deficiency, which then leads to an increase in inflammatory factors, including IL-17C. Thus, cell death is promoted, and kidney IRI is eventually aggravated. We link ALDH2 deficiency with inflammation, revealing a new idea for ALDH2-related research.",[],2022-08-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865241,Substantial Downregulation of Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Proteins during Acute Kidney Injury revealed by Data-Independent Acquisition Proteomics.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) manifests as a major health concern, particularly for the elderly. Understanding AKI-related proteome changes is critical for prevention and development of novel therapeutics to recover kidney function and to mitigate the susceptibility for recurrent AKI or development of chronic kidney disease. In this study, mouse kidneys were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury, and the contralateral kidneys remained uninjured to enable comparison and assess injury-induced changes in the kidney proteome. A fast-acquisition rate ZenoTOF 7600 mass spectrometer was introduced for data-independent acquisition (DIA) for comprehensive protein identification and quantification. Short microflow gradients and the generation of a deep kidney-specific spectral library allowed for high-throughput, comprehensive protein quantification. Upon AKI, the kidney proteome was completely remodeled, and over half of the 3,945 quantified protein groups changed significantly. Downregulated proteins in the injured kidney were involved in energy production, including numerous peroxisomal matrix proteins that function in fatty acid oxidation, such as ACOX1, CAT, EHHADH, ACOT4, ACOT8, and Scp2. Injured mice exhibited severely declined health. The comprehensive and sensitive kidney-specific DIA assays highlighted here feature high-throughput analytical capabilities to achieve deep coverage of the kidney proteome and will serve as useful tools for developing novel therapeutics to remediate kidney function.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865233,Augmentation of Histone Deacetylase 6 Activity Impairs Mitochondrial Respiratory Complex I in Ischemic/Reperfused Diabetic Hearts.,"Diabetes augments activity of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and generation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and impairs the physiological function of mitochondrial complex I (mCI) which oxidizes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to sustain the tricarboxylic acid cycle and β-oxidation. Here we examined how HDAC6 regulates TNFα production, mCI activity, mitochondrial morphology and NADH levels, and cardiac function in ischemic/reperfused diabetic hearts.HDAC6 knockout, streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic, and obese type 2 diabetic db/db mice underwent myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo or ex vivo in a Langendorff-perfused system. H9c2 cardiomyocytes with and without HDAC6 knockdown were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury in the presence of high glucose. We compared the activities of HDAC6 and mCI, TNFα and mitochondrial NADH levels, mitochondrial morphology, myocardial infarct size, and cardiac function between groups.Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and diabetes synergistically augmented myocardial HDCA6 activity, myocardial TNFα levels, and mitochondrial fission and inhibited mCI activity. Interestingly, neutralization of TNFα with an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody augmented myocardial mCI activity. Importantly, genetic disruption or inhibition of HDAC6 with tubastatin A decreased TNFα levels, mitochondrial fission, and myocardial mitochondrial NADH levels in ischemic/reperfused diabetic mice, concomitant with augmented mCI activity, decreased infarct size, and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction. In H9c2 cardiomyocytes cultured in high glucose, hypoxia/reoxygenation augmented HDAC6 activity and TNFα levels and decreased mCI activity. These negative effects were blocked by HDAC6 knockdown.Augmenting HDAC6 activity inhibits mCI activity by increasing TNFα levels in ischemic/reperfused diabetic hearts. The HDAC6 inhibitor, tubastatin A, has high therapeutic potential for acute myocardial infarction in diabetes.What Is Known?: Ischemic heart disease (IHS) is a leading cause of death globally, and its presence in diabetic patients is a grievous combination, leading to high mortality and heart failure.Diabetes impairs assembly of mitochondrial complex I (mCI), complex III dimer, and complex IV monomer into the respiratory chain supercomplexes, resulting in electron leak and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). By oxidizing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reducing ubiquinone, mCI physiologically regenerates NAD + to sustain the tricarboxylic acid cycle and β-oxidation. What New Information Does This Article Contribute?: Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) and diabetes as comorbidities augment myocardial HDCA6 activity and generation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which inhibit myocardial mCI activity.Genetic disruption of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) decreases mitochondrial NADH levels and augments mCI activity in type 1 diabetic mice undergoing MIRI via decreasing TNFα production, leading to decreases in MIRI.Pretreatment of type 2 diabetic db/db mice with a HDAC6 inhibitor, tubastatin A (TSA), decreases mitochondrial NADH levels and augments mCI activity by decreasing TNFα levels, leading to improvements in cardiac function. Patients with diabetes are more susceptible to MIRI than non-diabetics with greater mortality and resultant heart failure. There is an unmet medical need in diabetic patients for the treatment of IHS. Our biochemical studies find that MIRI and diabetes synergistically augment myocardial HDAC6 activity and generation of TNFα, along with cardiac mitochondrial fission and low bioactivity of mCI. Intriguingly, genetic disruption of HDAC6 decreases the MIRI-induced increases in TNFα levels, concomitant with augmented mCI activity, decreased myocardial infarct size, and ameliorated cardiac dysfunction in T1D mice. Importantly, treatment of obese T2D db/db mice with TSA reduces the generation of TNFα and mitochondrial fission and enhances mCI activity during reperfusion after ischemia. Our isolated heart studies revealed that genetic disruption or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 reduces mitochondrial NADH release during ischemia and ameliorates dysfunction of diabetic hearts undergoing MIRI. Furthermore, HDAC6 knockdown in cardiomyocytes blocks high glucose- and exogenous TNFα-induced suppression of mCI activity in vitro , implying that HDAC6 knockdown can preserve mCI activity in high glucose and hypoxia/reoxygenation. These results demonstrate that HDAC6 is an important mediator in MIRI and cardiac function in diabetes. Selective inhibition of HDAC6 has high therapeutic potential for acute IHS in diabetes.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865056,Microvascular dysfunction following cardiopulmonary bypass plays a central role in postoperative organ dysfunction.,"Despite significant advances in surgical technique and strategies for tissue/organ protection, cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass is a profound stressor on the human body and is associated with numerous intraoperative and postoperative collateral effects across different tissues and organ systems. Of note, cardiopulmonary bypass has been shown to induce significant alterations in microvascular reactivity. This involves altered myogenic tone, altered microvascular responsiveness to many endogenous vasoactive agonists, and generalized endothelial dysfunction across multiple vascular beds. This review begins with a survey of in vitro studies that examine the cellular mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction following cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass, with a focus on endothelial activation, weakened barrier integrity, altered cell surface receptor expression, and changes in the balance between vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory mediators. Microvascular dysfunction in turn influences postoperative organ dysfunction in complex, poorly understood ways. Hence the second part of this review will highlight in vivo studies examining the effects of cardiac surgery on critical organ systems, notably the heart, brain, renal system, and skin/peripheral tissue vasculature. Clinical implications and possible areas for intervention will be discussed throughout the review.","['cardiac surgery', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'microvasculature', 'organ damage', 'vasomotor tone']",2022-11-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36865048,Aortic ischemia-reperfusion injury and potency of fluoxetine.,"Due to cross-clamping of the aorta during aortic aneurysm surgeries, ischemia-reperfusion (IR) develops, and it may cause damage to the aorta itself or even to remote organs by oxidative stress or inflammation. Fluoxetine (FLX) which might be used in the preoperative period for its tranquilizing effect also has antioxidant effects in short-term use. The purpose of our study is to examine whether FLX protects aorta tissue, against the damage caused by IR.Three groups of Wistar rats were formed randomly. 1) Control group (sham-operated), 2) IR group (60 min ischemia+120 min perfusion), and 3) FLX+IR group (FLX dose was 20 mg/kg for 3 days IP before IR). At the end of each procedure, aorta samples were collected, and oxidant-antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic status of the aorta were evaluated. Histological examinations of the samples were provided.Levels of LOOH, MDA, ROS, TOS, MPO, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, NF-kB, MMP-9, caspase-9, 8-OHdG, NO, and HA were found to be significantly increased in the IR group compared with control (P<0.05) and SOD, GSH, TAS, and IL-10 levels were significantly lower (P<0.05). FLX significantly decreased LOOH, MDA, ROS, TOS, MPO, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, NF-kB, MMP-9, caspase-9, 8-OHdG, NO, and HA levels in the FLX+IR group compared with IR group (P<0.05) and increased IL-10, SOD, GSH, and TAS (P<0.05). FLX administration prevented the deterioration of aortic tissue damage.Our study is the first study that demonstrates FLX-mediated suppression of IR injury in the infrarenal abdominal aorta by antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties.","['Aorta', 'Apoptosis', 'Fluoxetine', 'Inflammation', 'Oxidative stress', 'Rats', 'Reperfusion injury']",2022-06-08,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

This research aimed to investigate the effect of coadministration of gallic acid and the GSK650394 (as SGK1 gene inhibitor) on the ischemic complications of a rat model of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups with or without pretreatment with gallic acid for 10 days. After that, the heart was isolated and perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution. A 30 min of ischemia was performed followed by a 60 min reperfusion. In 2 groups, GSK650394 was infused 5 min before ischemia induction. Ten minutes after reperfusion commencement, cardiac marker enzyme (CK-MB, LDH, and cTn-I) activities were measured in the cardiac perfusate. At the end of reperfusion, the activity of anti-oxidant enzymes (Catalase, Superoxide dismutase, and Glutathione peroxidase), lipid peroxidation (MDA), total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), infarct size, and SGK1 gene expression were measured in the heart tissue.The results indicated that dual therapy with both drugs significantly improved endogenous anti-oxidant enzyme activity and TAC more than each drug alone. However, the heart marker enzymes (CK-MB, LDH, and cTn-I), MDA, ROS, infarct size, and SGK1 gene expression were reduced significantly compared with the ischemic group.The results of this study suggest that concomitant administration of both drugs in the case of cardiac I/R injury may have a more beneficial effect than each one alone.","['GSK650394', 'Gallic acid', 'Heart', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reperfusion injury', 'Serum-glucocorticoid - regulated kinase 1']",2022-09-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cardiac injury and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) secondary to COVID-19 disease can lead to hospitalization, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. When serious collateral damage from tissue necrosis or bleeding occurs, mechanical complications of myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock can ensue. While prompt reperfusion therapies have decreased the incidence of these serious complications, patients who present late following the initial infarct are at increased for mechanical complications, cardiogenic shock, and death. The health outcomes for patients with mechanical complications are dismal if not recognized and treated promptly. Even if they survive serious pump failure, their CICU stay is often prolonged, and their index hospitalization and follow-up visits may consume significant resources and impact the health care system.","['COVID-19', 'Cardiogenic shock', 'Mechanical Complications', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Reperfusion therapies']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36863495,Neuroprotection by the cannabidiol aminoquinone VCE-004.8 in experimental ischemic stroke in mice.,"Synthetic cannabidiol (CBD) derivative VCE-004.8 is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) dual agonist with hypoxia mimetic activity. The oral formulation of VCE-004.8, termed EHP-101, possesses anti-inflammatory properties and is currently in phase 2 clinical trials for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The activation of PPARγ or CB2 receptors exerts neuroprotective effects by dampening neuroinflammation in ischemic stroke models. However, the effect of a dual PPARγ/CB2 agonist in ischemic stroke models is not known. Here, we demonstrate that treatment with VCE-004.8 confers neuroprotection in young mice subjected to cerebral ischemia. Male C57BL/6J mice, aged 3-4 months, were subjected to 30-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We evaluated the effect of intraperitoneal VCE-004.8 treatment (10 or 20 mg/kg) either at the onset of reperfusion or 4h or 6h after the reperfusion. Seventy-two hours after ischemia, animals were subjected to behavioral tests. Immediately after the tests, animals were perfused, and brains were collected for histology and PCR analysis. Treatment with VCE-004.8 either at the onset or 4h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct volume and improved behavioral outcomes. A trend toward reduction in stroke injury was observed in animals receiving the drug starting 6h after recirculation. VCE-004.8 significantly reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in BBB breakdown. Mice receiving VCE-004.8 had significantly lower levels of extravasated IgG in the brain parenchyma, indicating protection against stroke-induced BBB disruption. Lower levels of active matrix metalloproteinase-9 were found in the brain of drug-treated animals. Our data show that VCE-004.8 is a promising drug candidate for treating ischemic brain injury. Since VCE-004.8 has been shown to be safe in the clinical setting, the possibility of repurposing its use as a delayed treatment option for ischemic stroke adds substantial translational value to our findings.","['Blood-brain barrier', 'Cannabinoids', 'Ischemic stroke', 'Neuroinflammation', 'VCE-004.8']",2023-01-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

36860545,Diminished AdipoR1/APPL1 Interaction Mediates Reduced Cardioprotective Actions of Adiponectin against Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Type-2 Diabetic Mice.,"Obesity-related diseases have important implications for the occurrence, severity, and outcome of ischemic heart disease. Patients with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (metabolic syndrome) are at increased risk of heart attack with decreased plasma lipocalin levels, and lipocalin is negatively correlated with heart attack incidence. APPL1 is a signaling protein with multiple functional structural domains and plays an important role in the APN signaling pathway. There are two known subtypes of lipocalin membrane receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. AdioR1 is mainly distributed in skeletal muscle while AdipoR2 is mainly distributed in the liver.To clarify whether the AdipoR1-APPL1 signaling pathway mediates the effect of lipocalin in reducing myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and its mechanism will provide us with a new approach to treat myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury using lipocalin as an intervention and therapeutic target.(1) Induction of hypoxia/reoxygenation in SD mammary rat cardiomyocytes to simulate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion; (2) downregulation of APPL1 expression in cardiomyocytes to observe the effect of lipocalin on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion and its mechanism of action.(1) Primary mammary rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured and induced to simulate MI/R by hypoxia/reoxygenation; (2) lipocalin inhibited H/R-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes; and (3) APN attenuated MI/R injury through AdipoR1-APPL1 and the possible mechanism.This study demonstrates for the first time that lipocalin can attenuate myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury through the AdipoR1-APPL1 signaling pathway and that the reduction of AdipoR1/APPL1 interaction plays an important role in cardiac APN resistance to MI/R injury in diabetic mice.",[],2022-08-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36860242,Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis critically rewires the ischemia/reperfusion-induced dysregulation of cardiolipins and sphingolipids in mice.,"Lipid dysregulation plays a fundamental role in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is an emerging critical risk factor that aggravates hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the specific lipids that mediate the aggressive I/R injury in NASH livers have not yet been identified.The mouse model of hepatic I/R injury on NASH was established on C56B/6J mice by first feeding the mice with a Western-style diet to induce NASH, then the NASH mice were subjected to surgical procedures to induce hepatic I/R injury. Untargeted lipidomics were performed to determine hepatic lipids in NASH livers with I/R injury through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The pathology associated with the dysregulated lipids was examined.Lipidomics analyses identified cardiolipins (CL) and sphingolipids (SL), including ceramides (CER), glycosphingolipids, sphingosines, and sphingomyelins, as the most relevant lipid classes that characterized the lipid dysregulation in NASH livers with I/R injury. CER were increased in normal livers with I/R injury, and the I/R-induced increase of CER was further augmented in NASH livers. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of CER were highly upregulated in NASH livers with I/R injury, including serine palmitoyltransferase 3 (Sptlc3), ceramide synthase 2 (Cers2), neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (Smpd3), and glucosylceramidase beta 2 (Gba2) that produced CER, and alkaline ceramidase 2 (Acer2), alkaline ceramidase 3 (Acer3), sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (Sgpl1), and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 (Sgpp1) that catalyzed the degradation of CER. CL were not affected by I/R challenge in normal livers, but CL was dramatically reduced in NASH livers with I/R injury. Consistently, metabolic pathway analyses revealed that the enzymes catalyzing the generation of CL were downregulated in NASH-I/R injury, including cardiolipin synthase (Crls1) and tafazzin (Taz). Notably, the I/R-induced oxidative stress and cell death were found to be aggravated in NASH livers, which were possibly mediated by the reduction of CL and accumulation of CER.The I/R-induced dysregulation of CL and SL were critically rewired by NASH, which might potentially mediate the aggressive I/R injury in NASH livers.","['Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics']",2021-03-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36859841,[Update on the role and mechanism of erythropoietin receptor in acute kidney injury and repair or fibrosis].,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common critical disease clinically with high morbility and mortality and some survival patients also progress to chronic kidney disease. Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) is one of the main causes of AKI, in which, its repair and potential fibrosis, apoptosis, inflammation and phagocytosis play important roles. During the progression of IR-induced AKI, the expression of erythropoietin homodimer receptor (EPOR)2 and EPOR and β common receptor formed heterodimer receptor (EPOR/βcR) is changed dynamically. Moreover, (EPOR)2 and EPOR/βcR may synergistically participate in renoprotection at the stage of AKI and early repair, whereas at the late stage of AKI, the (EPOR)2 induces renal fibrosis and the EPOR/βcR facilitates repair and remodelling. The underlying mechanism, signaling pathways and the different effect turning point of (EPOR)2 and EPOR/βcR have not been well defined. It has been reported that EPO, according to its 3D structure, derived helix B surface peptide (HBSP) and cyclic HBSP (CHBP) only bind to EPOR/βcR. Synthesized HBSP, therefore, provides an effective tool to distinguish the different roles and mechanisms of both receptors, with the (EPOR)2 promoting fibrosis or the EPOR/βcR leading to repair/remodelling at the late stage of AKI.

Male BALB/c mice were subjected to UIRI, and treated with CPD1 once daily (i.g, 5 mg/kg). Contralateral nephrectomy was performed on day 10 after UIRI, and the UIRI kidneys were harvested on day 11. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Masson trichrome and Sirius Red staining methods were used to observe the renal tissue structural lesions and fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blot were used to detect the expression of proteins related to fibrosis. HE, Sirius Red and Masson trichrome staining showed that CPD1-treated UIRI mice had lower extent of tubular epithelial cell injury and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in renal interstitium compared with those in the fibrotic mouse kidneys. The results from immunohistochemistry and Western blot assay indicated significantly decreased protein expressions of type I collagen, fibronectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) after CPD1 treatment. In addition, CPD1 dose-dependently inhibited the expression of ECM-related proteins induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) in normal rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2).

36859428,Inhibition of ALKBH5 attenuates I/R-induced renal injury in male mice by promoting Ccl28 m6A modification and increasing Treg recruitment.,"Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). The role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in AKI remains unclear. Here, we characterize the role of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) and m6A modification in an I/R-induced renal injury model in male mice. Alkbh5-knockout mice exhibit milder pathological damage and better renal function than wild-type mice post-IRI, whereas Alkbh5-knockin mice show contrary results. Also conditional knockout of Alkbh5 in the tubular epithelial cells alleviates I/R-induced AKI and fibrosis. CCL28 is identified as a target of ALKBH5. Furthermore, Ccl28 mRNA stability increases with Alkbh5 deficiency, mediating by the binding of insulin-like growth factor 2 binding protein 2. Treg recruitment is upregulated and inflammatory cells are inhibited by the increased CCL28 level in IRI-Alkbh5fl/flKspCre mice. The ALKBH5 inhibitor IOX1 exhibits protective effects against I/R-induced AKI. In summary, inhibition of ALKBH5 promotes the m6A modifications of Ccl28 mRNA, enhancing its stability, and regulating the Treg/inflammatory cell axis. ALKBH5 and this axis is a potential AKI treatment target.",[],2022-08-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36858921,Inferior Subtle ST Elevation. Would You Activate Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory?,"According to guidelines, patients with inferior myocardial infarction only qualify for emergent reperfusion if they have at least 1 mm of ST elevation in two contiguous inferior leads. Although this has remained the standard for years, acute coronary occlusion may occur in patients with nondiagnostic ST elevation. Accordingly, a paradigm change is instigated, shifting the focus to physiopathology (occlusion myocardial infarction) rather than ST criteria.A middle-aged man presented to our emergency department with chest pain and subtle nondiagnostic electrocardiography (ECG) changes in inferior leads. A careful examination of aVL to detect ST depression in this lead was the key to successfully diagnosing occlusion myocardial infarction, allowing early revascularization of an occluded right coronary artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Accurate diagnosis of coronary occlusion by means of ECG can be challenging in certain situations, as acute myocardial ischemia may occur in patients with nondiagnostic ST elevation, especially in the inferior leads. A thorough examination of aVL searching for ST depression is essential in these situations.","['ST elevation myocardial infarction', 'STEMI', 'myocardial infarction']",2022-09-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36857749,Potential Cardioprotective Role of Menaquinone-4 Against Cardiac Ischemia-reperfusion Injury.,"Myocardial infarction is among the leading causes of mortality. Menaquinone-4 (MK-4), a vitamin K2 analog, might play a role in rescuing cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This work aimed to discover the potential cardioprotective role of MK-4 against myocardial I/R injury in rats. Thirty-two rats were categorized into 3 groups: (I/R) control group: subjected to I/R protocol (received vehicle), MK-4 preconditioning group: MK-4 infusion for 20 minutes before the I/R protocol, and MK-4 postconditioning group: MK-4 infusion for 20 minutes at the start of the reperfusion phase. The hearts were placed in the Langendorff apparatus, and the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), heart rate (HR), + (LV dP/dt) max, - (LV dP/dt) max, and Tau were calculated. The necrotic mass was determined by staining it with nitro blue tetrazolium. Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C- reactive protein (CRP), as well as cardiac superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitric oxide (NOx), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) levels were all evaluated. MK-4 postconditioning significantly reduced myocardial infarct size; increased LVDP, + (LV dp/dt) max, - (LV dp/dt) max, and HR; reduced Tau, CK-MB, LDH, CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, and NOx levels; and increased SOD activity, whereas no significant difference in the GSH level was detected. In conclusion, these data imply that MK-4 may protect the heart from the consequences of I/R.",[],2022-03-27,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36857499,Tubular Epithelial Cell HMGB1 Promotes AKI-CKD Transition by Sensitizing Cycling Tubular Cells to Oxidative Stress: A Rationale for Targeting HMGB1 during AKI Recovery.,"Cells undergoing necrosis release extracellular high mobility group box (HMGB)-1, which triggers sterile inflammation upon AKI in mice. Neither deletion of HMGB1 from tubular epithelial cells, nor HMGB1 antagonism with small molecules, affects initial ischemic tubular necrosis and immediate GFR loss upon unilateral ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). On the contrary, tubular cell-specific HMGB1 deficiency, and even late-onset pharmacological HMGB1 inhibition, increased functional and structural recovery from AKI, indicating that intracellular HMGB1 partially counters the effects of extracellular HMGB1. In vitro studies indicate that intracellular HMGB1 decreases resilience of tubular cells from prolonged ischemic stress, as in unilateral IRI. Intracellular HMGB1 is a potential target to enhance kidney regeneration and to improve long-term prognosis in AKI.Late diagnosis is a hurdle for treatment of AKI, but targeting AKI-CKD transition may improve outcomes. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear regulator of transcription and a driver of necroinflammation in AKI. We hypothesized that HMGB1 would also modulate AKI-CKD transition in other ways.We conducted single-cell transcriptome analysis of human and mouse AKI and mouse in vivo and in vitro studies with tubular cell-specific depletion of Hmgb1 and HMGB1 antagonists.HMGB1 was ubiquitously expressed in kidney cells. Preemptive HMGB1 antagonism with glycyrrhizic acid (Gly) and ethyl pyruvate (EP) did not affect postischemic AKI but attenuated AKI-CKD transition in a model of persistent kidney hypoxia. Consistently, tubular Hmgb1 depletion in Pax8 rtTA, TetO Cre, Hmgb1fl/fl mice did not protect from AKI, but from AKI-CKD transition. In vitro studies confirmed that absence of HMGB1 or HMGB1 inhibition with Gly and EP does not affect ischemic necrosis of growth-arrested differentiated tubular cells but increased the resilience of cycling tubular cells that survived the acute injury to oxidative stress. This effect persisted when neutralizing extracellular HMGB1 with 2G7. Consistently, late-onset HMGB1 blockade with EP started after the peak of ischemic AKI in mice prevented AKI-CKD transition, even when 2G7 blocked extracellular HMGB1.Treatment of AKI could become feasible when ( 1 ) focusing on long-term outcomes of AKI; ( 2 ) targeting AKI-CKD transition with drugs initiated after the AKI peak; and ( 3 ) targeting with drugs that block HMGB1 in intracellular and extracellular compartments.",[],2021-12-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36856879,"Chlorogenic Acid Alleviates Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Mitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis In Vivo and In Vitro.","Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is the main reason for organ failure following liver surgery; however, its underlying causes are complex, and include oxidative stress, sterile inflammatory, and mitochondrial damage. Unfortunately, treatments for HIRI are based on supportive therapy, and no specific drugs or methods are currently available. Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a dietary polyphenol with a wide range of pharmacological effects and it has a protective effect on HIRI; however, its specific mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated that CGA pretreatment exerts protective effects against HIRI and the potential underlying mechanisms. We found that CGA pretreatment reduced ALT, AST, MDA, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels following HIRI, improved SOD and GSH levels, and alleviated pathological liver tissue damage, with the highest CGA dose (100 mg/kg.d) exerted the strongest effect. In addition, we showed that CGA pretreatment significantly decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species following HIRI, inhibited HMGB1 release by decreasing IRF-1 expression, inhibited the expression of HMGB1, TLR-4, MyD88, P-IκB-α, NF-κB P65, and P-P65, and promoted IκB-α degradation. Thus, CGA appears to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammatory responses during HIRI. Furthermore, we found that CGA pretreatment reduced hepatocyte apoptosis following HIRI, alleviated mitochondrial damage, promoted BCL-2 expression, inhibited Bax upregulation, and inhibited cytochrome C release to prevent caspase activation, thereby reducing the expression of the caspase-independent pathway components, ENDOG and AIF. Together, our findings suggest that CGA can protect against HIRI by inhibiting oxidative stress, the HMGB1/TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway-mediated inflammatory responses, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Thus, CGA appears to be a promising therapeutic approach for treating HIRI.","['Chlorogenic acid', 'Hepatic ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'Inflammation', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidative stress']",2022-09-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36856810,Evaluating the role of intravenous pentoxifylline administration on primary percutaneous coronary intervention success rate in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (PENTOS-PCI).,"Ischemia reperfusion injury can lead to further myocardiocyte damage in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine derivative with known anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, vasodilator, and rheological properties which can be a promising agent in preventing reperfusion injury. PENTOS-PCI is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the efficacy and safety of preprocedural administration of intravenous pentoxifylline in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with acute STEMI who were eligible for PCI were randomized to receive either 100-mg intravenous infusion of pentoxifylline or placebo, prior to transferring to catheterization laboratory. Overall, 161 patients were included in our study of whom 80 patients were assigned to pentoxifylline and 81 to the control groups. Per-protocol analysis of primary endpoint indexing PCI's success rate as measured by thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 was not significantly different between pentoxifylline and placebo (71.3% and 66.3% respectively, P = 0.40). In addition, pentoxifylline could not improve secondary angiographic endpoints including myocardial blush grade 3 (87.5% and 85.2%, P = 0.79) and corrected TIMI frame count (22.8 [± 9.0] and 24.0 [± 5.1], P = 0.33) in the intervention and placebo groups respectively. The rates of major adverse cardiac and treatment emergent adverse effects were not significantly different between the two groups. Administration of intravenous pentoxifylline before primary PCI did not improve the success rate of the procedure in patients with STEMI. Intravenous administration of pentoxifylline was well tolerated, and there were no significant differences regarding adverse drug reactions in the two groups.

We compared angiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with occlusions of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery treated with mechanical thrombectomy using extra-LB-DAC versus LB-DAC in combination with stent-retrievers.We analyzed consecutive patients with M1 occlusion included in the ROSSETTI registry treated with non-balloon guide catheter combined LB-DAC/stent-retriever thrombectomy between June 2019 and April 2022. We compared demographics, baseline clinical variables, procedural variables, angiographic outcomes, and clinical outcomes [National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 h (24h-NIHSS) and modified Rankin scale score at 3 months] between patients treated with extra-LB-DAC (Sofia Plus, MIVI Q6, Catalyst7; inner diameter, 0.068″-0.070″) versus LB-DAC (Sofia 5F, MIVI Q5, Catalyst 6; inner diameter, 0.055″-0.064″). Primary outcome was the first-pass effect (FPE) rate, defined as near-complete/complete reperfusion (mTICI 2c-3) after a single pass of the device.We included 324 patients (extra-LB-DAC, 185, 57.1% patients). Demographics, clinical data, and clinical outcomes were similar between the two groups; however, there was a trend towards improvement in National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 h (24h-NIHSS) in the cohort treated with extra-LB-DAC 9 points (IQR 4;16 points) vs. 12 points (IQR 4;18 points, P = 0.083). Patients treated with extra-LB-DAC had higher FPE rate (47% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.003) and higher modified FPE (mTICI ≥ 2b after a single pass) rate (65.9% vs 46.8%; P = 0.001). The use of extra-LB-DAC was an independent factor in predicting FPE (odds ratio 1.982, 95% confidence interval 1.250-3.143, P = 0.004).Our results suggest that in combined LB-DAC/stent-retriever thrombectomy, a larger aspiration catheter inner diameter is associated with higher rates of FPE and mFPE.","['Endovascular', 'Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Recovery', 'Treatment']",2022-10-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36856510,Management Strategies for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection Complicated By Limb Malperfusion.,"Acute type A aortic dissection complicated by limb malperfusion presents a risk of mortality to the patients. Debates exist regarding management, whether focused on reperfusion first or immediate repair. Here, we aimed to describe our experience with the management of acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) complicated by limb malperfusion.From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, 22 consecutive patients were admitted to Xiamen Cardiovascular Hospital, due to acute type A aortic dissection complicated by limb malperfusion. All perioperative variables were recorded and analyzed. Limb malperfusion was diagnosed, according to the clinical symptoms, computed tomography angiography, and laboratory test. We adopted the clinical categories of acute limb ischemia to stratify severity of limb ischemia. Surgery strategies are as follows: Reperfusion first followed by central repair, immediate central repair, and immediate central repair followed by stenting.There were 21 males and one female with an average of 53.3±11.7 years. Management strategies were as follows: immediate central repair using total arch replacement with frozen elephant trunk in 15 patients, endovascular stenting followed by central repair in four patients, and endovascular stenting after central repair in two patients. The average extracorporeal circulation time was 258.8 ± 70.5 min; the average aortic cross-clamp time was 177.9 ± 54.2 min; and the average circulatory arrest time was 45.5 ± 13.1 min. The early mortality rate was 13.6% (3/22). Two patients left the hospital voluntarily, due to cerebral infarction and bleeding. One patient underwent fasciotomy for osteofascial compartment syndrome and uneventfully was discharged. Six patients underwent continuous renal replacement therapy and hemoperfusion.Central repair is safe and feasible for ATAAD complicated with limb malperfusion. For serious limb malperfusion, endovascular stenting followed by central repair is a good choice with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and hemoperfusion. Hospital mortality rate is high in cases with multiple organ malperfusion.",[],2022-09-07,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

However, serial sampling in this condition is very dangerous and pose iatrogenic anemia with blood loss. This study was done to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of point-of-care salivary tests and identify the validity of salivary markers.Rats were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: (1) control (2) IR-3 h (3) IR-6 h (4) IR-24 h. Both renal pedicles were occluded for 55 min and then were declamped to allow reperfusion for 3, 6 and 24 h in IR groups. After reperfusion, all rats received pilocarpine 1 mg/kg to collect saliva. Plasma samples were also collected. Renal parameters including Cr, uric acid, and urea, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, nitrite/nitrate ratio, corticosterone levels and oxidant/antioxidant ratio were measured in both plasma and salivary samples.There were significant increased level of renal function parameters, MDA levels, Bax/Bcl2 ratio, nitrite/nitrate ratio and corticosterone in both saliva and plasma. The comparison of above parameters in both saliva and plasma showed significant correlation.This study demonstrated that concentrations of indices specifically renal functional parameters increase in saliva in the IR-induced kidney injury in male rats and result indicate the potential of saliva as a tool to monitoring AKI. Measurement of salivary parameters may can become reliable diagnostic tests for patients with AKI.","['acute kidney injury', 'plasma', 'rat', 'renal ischemia-reperfusion', 'saliva']",2022-08-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36855153,A short peptide exerts neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing inflammation via the miR-6328/IKKβ/NF-κB axis.,"Despite considerable efforts, ischemic stroke (IS) remains a challenging clinical problem. Therefore, the discovery of effective therapeutic and targeted drugs based on the underlying molecular mechanism is crucial for effective IS treatment.A cDNA-encoding peptide was cloned from RNA extracted from Rana limnocharis skin, and the mature amino acid sequence was predicted and synthesized. Hemolysis and acute toxicity of the peptide were tested. Furthermore, its neuroprotective properties were evaluated using a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in rats and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in neuron-like PC12 cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms were explored using microRNA (miRNA) sequencing, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and western blotting.A new peptide (NP1) with an amino acid sequence of 'FLPAAICLVIKTC' was identified. NP1 showed no obvious toxicities in vivo and in vitro and was able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Intraperitoneal administration of NP1 (10 nmol/kg) effectively reduced the volume of cerebral infarction and relieved neurological dysfunction in MCAO/R model rats. Moreover, NP1 significantly alleviated the decrease in viability and increase in apoptosis of neuron-like PC12 cells induced by OGD/R. NP1 effectively suppressed inflammation by reducing interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, NP1 up-regulated the expression of miR-6328, which, in turn, down-regulated kappa B kinase β (IKKβ). IKKβ reduced the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) and inhibitor of NF-κB (I-κB), thereby inhibiting activation of the NF-κB pathway.The newly discovered non-toxic peptide NP1 ('FLPAAICLVIKTC') exerted neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by reducing inflammation via the miR-6328/IKKβ/NF-κB axis. Our findings not only provide an exogenous peptide drug candidate and endogenous small nucleic acid drug candidate but also a new drug target for the treatment of IS. This study highlights the importance of peptides in the development of new drugs, elucidation of pathological mechanisms, and discovery of new drug targets.","['IKKβ', 'Ischemic stroke', 'NF-κB', 'Neuroprotection', 'Peptide', 'miR-6328']",2022-07-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Herein, we investigated biological and physiological parameters of the brain and heart, and we particularly focused on the lung dysfunction that has not been well studied to date. We aimed to understand tissue-specific susceptibility to oxidative stress and tested how oxygen concentrations in the post-resuscitation setting would affect outcomes. Rats were resuscitated from 10 min of asphyxia CA. Mechanical ventilation was initiated at the beginning of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We examined animals with or without CA, and those were further divided into the animals exposed to 100% oxygen (CA_Hypero) or those with 30% oxygen (CA_Normo) for 2 h after resuscitation. Biological and physiological parameters of the brain, heart, and lungs were assessed. The brain and lung functions were decreased after CA and resuscitation indicated by worse modified neurological score as compared to baseline (222 ± 33 vs. 500 ± 0, P < 0.05), and decreased PaO2 (20 min after resuscitation: 113 ± 9 vs. baseline: 128 ± 9 mmHg, P < 0.05) and increased airway pressure (2 h: 10.3 ± 0.3 vs. baseline: 8.1 ± 0.2 mmHg, P < 0.001), whereas the heart function measured by echocardiography did not show significant differences compared before and after CA (ejection fraction, 24 h: 77.9 ± 3.3% vs. baseline: 82.2 ± 1.9%, P = 0.2886; fractional shortening, 24 h: 42.9 ± 3.1% vs. baseline: 45.7 ± 1.9%, P = 0.4658). Likewise, increases of superoxide production in the brain and lungs were remarkable, while those in the heart were moderate. mRNA gene expression analysis revealed that CA_Hypero group had increases in Il1b as compared to CA_Normo group significantly in the brain (P < 0.01) and lungs (P < 0.001) but not the heart (P = 0.4848). Similarly, hyperoxia-induced increases in other inflammatory and apoptotic mRNA gene expression were observed in the brain, whereas no differences were found in the heart. Upon systemic IR injury initiated by asphyxia CA, hyperoxia-induced injury exacerbated inflammation/apoptosis signals in the brain and lungs but might not affect the heart.

36853611,Effect of a Combined Drug Approach on the Severity of Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury During Liver Transplant: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"In a porcine model of liver transplant, a combined drug approach that targeted the donor graft and graft recipient reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury, a major hurdle to the success of liver transplant.To assess the effect of a clinical form of a perioperative combined drug approach delivered immediately before implantation to the procured liver and to the liver recipient on the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury.This unicentric, investigator-driven, open-label randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel arms was conducted in Belgium from September 2013 through February 2018, with 1-year follow-up. Adults wait-listed for a first solitary full-size liver transplant were screened for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were acute liver failure, kidney failure, contraindication to treatment, participation in another trial, refusal, technical issues, and death while awaiting transplant. Included patients were enrolled and randomized at the time of liver offer. Data were analyzed from May 20, 2019, to May 27, 2020.Participants were randomized to a combined drug approach with standard of care (static cold storage) or standard of care only (control group). In the combined drug approach group, following static cold preservation, donor livers were infused with epoprostenol (ex situ, portal vein); recipients were given oral α-tocopherol and melatonin prior to anesthesia and intravenous antithrombin III, infliximab, apotransferrin, recombinant erythropoietin-β, C1-inhibitor, and glutathione during the anhepatic and reperfusion phase.The primary outcome was the posttransplant peak serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level within the first 72 hours. Secondary end points were the frequencies of postreperfusion syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury score, early allograft dysfunction, surgical complications, ischemic cholangiopathy, acute kidney injury, acute cellular rejection, and graft and patient survival.Of 93 randomized patients, 21 were excluded, resulting in 72 patients (36 per study arm) in the per protocol analysis (median recipient age, 60 years [IQR, 51.7-66.2 years]; 52 [72.2%] men). Peak AST serum levels were not different in the combined drug approach and control groups (geometric mean, 1262.9 U/L [95% CI, 946.3-1685.4 U/L] vs 1451.2 U/L [95% CI, 1087.4-1936.7 U/L]; geometric mean ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.58-1.31]; P = .49) (to convert AST to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). There also were no significant differences in the secondary end points between the groups.In this randomized clinical trial, the combined drug approach targeting the post-cold storage graft and the recipient did not decrease ischemic-reperfusion injury. The findings suggest that in addition to a downstream strategy that targets the preimplantation liver graft and the graft recipient, a clinically effective combined drug approach may need to include an upstream strategy that targets the donor graft during preservation.

36852976,EFFECTS OF MESENCHYMAL STEM CELLS ON POSTRESUSCITATION RENAL AND INTESTINAL INJURIES IN A PORCINE CARDIAC ARREST MODEL.,"Objectives: Systemic ischemia-reperfusion triggered by cardiac arrest (CA) and resuscitation often causes postresuscitation multiple organ injuries. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proven to be a promising treatment for regional renal and intestinal ischemia reperfusion injuries. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs on renal and intestinal injuries after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in a porcine CA model. Methods: Twenty-two male pigs were randomly assigned to the sham (n = 6), CA/CPR (n = 8), and CA/CPR + MSC (n = 8) groups. Mesenchymal stem cells were differentiated from human embryonic stem cells and then intravenously administered at a dose of 2.5 × 10 6 /kg at 1.5 and 3 d before the CA/CPR procedure. The experimental model was established by 8 min of untreated CA, followed by 8 min of CPR. Renal and intestinal injuries were evaluated based on the serum levels of creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and diamine oxidase at 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after resuscitation. At the end of the experiment, pathological damage was determined by cell apoptosis and ferroptosis in the renal and intestinal tissues. Results: During CPR, five pigs in the CA/CPR group and seven pigs in the CA/CPR + MSC group were successfully resuscitated. After resuscitation, the serum levels of creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein, and diamine oxidase were significantly increased in the CA/CPR and CA/CPR + MSC groups compared with those in the sham group. However, MSC administration significantly decreased the levels of renal and intestinal injury biomarkers compared with those in the CA/CPR group. Cell apoptosis and ferroptosis, which were indicated by the levels of apoptotic cells, iron deposition, lipid peroxidation, antioxidants, and ferroptosis-related proteins, were observed in renal and intestinal tissues after resuscitation in the CA/CPR and CA/CPR + MSC groups. Nevertheless, both were significantly milder in the CA/CPR + MSC group than in the CA/CPR group. Conclusions: MSC administration was effective in alleviating postresuscitation renal and intestinal injuries possibly through inhibition of cell apoptosis and ferroptosis in a porcine CA model.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Cohort studies, case series, and interventional studies written in English which evaluated the efficacy and safety of IC epinephrine in patients with no-flow phenomenon were included in our review.Six of the 646 articles identified in the initial search met our inclusion criteria. IC epinephrine was used either as a first-line treatment [two randomized clinical trials (RCTs)] or after the failure of conventional agents (two cohort studies and two case series) for restoring the coronary flow, mainly after primary PCI. As first-line therapy, IC epinephrine successfully restored coronary flow in over 90% of patients in both RCTs, which significantly outperformed IC adenosine (78%) but lagged behind combination of verapamil and tirofiban (100%) in this regard. In the refractory no-flow phenomenon, successful reperfusion [thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade = 3] was achieved in three out of four patients after the administration of IC epinephrine based on the results from both case series. Their findings were confirmed by a recent cohort study that further compared IC epinephrine with IC adenosine and found significant differences between them in terms of efficacy [% TIMI flow grade 3: (69.1% versus 52.7%, respectively; p value = 0.04)] and 1-year major adverse cardiac event (MACE) outcomes (11.3% versus 26.7%, respectively; p value ⩽ 0.01). Overall, malignant ventricular arrhythmias were reported in none of the patients treated with IC epinephrine.Results from available evidence suggest that IC epinephrine might be an effective and safe agent in managing the no-reflow phenomenon.","['PCI', 'TIMI', 'epinephrine', 'no-reflow phenomenon', 'reperfusion therapy']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is an effective medicine for ischemic stroke that reduces cell apoptosis and improves long-term prognosis.Whether and how NBP regulates mitochondria-associated apoptosis in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury remains unclear.Male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke and treated with low (20 mg/kg) or high (80 mg/kg) concentrations of NBP. The Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor UCF-101 was used as a positive control. Cerebral infarction, neuron injury and neuronal apoptosis were assessed to determine the efficacy of NBP compared to UCF-101. We assessed the expression of the Omi/HtrA2 signaling pathway by western blotting and tested the mRNA expression of mitochondrial metabolism-related genes by PCR.Compared to the MCAO group, both low and high concentrations of NBP substantially improved cerebral infarction, neuron injury, and neuronal apoptosis; high concentrations of NBP were more potent than low concentrations. The expression of proteins of the mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2 signaling pathway, including Omi/HtrA2, XIAP, PARL, OPA1, CHOP, and ClpP, was inhibited in the NBP group.Overall, early application of NBP attenuated cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting mitochondrial Omi/HtrA2-mediated apoptosis in rats.

CMBs were described as absent or present and WMH severity was described according to the Fazekas classification (0-1, absent-mild; 2-3, moderate to severe). Outcomes consisted of any intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at 24 h and favorable outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score between 0 and 2).In all, 246 patients were included. The intensive systolic blood pressure target was not associated with lower rates of ICH or favorable outcome according to CSVD subgroups (all p values >0.35). Several BPV parameters were associated with increased odds of ICH in patients with CMBs but not in patients without CMBs (diastolic blood pressure coefficient of variation, odds ratio 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-3.77, in patients with ≥1 CMB vs. 0.94, 95% CI 0.68-1.31, in patients without CMBs, phet  = 0.026). Several diastolic BPV parameters were associated with worse outcomes in patients with severe WMHs but not in patients without WMHs (diastolic blood pressure coefficient of variation, odds ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.17-0.61, in patients with severe WMHs vs. 1.09, 95% CI 0.67-1.79, in patients without WMHs; phet  = 0.003).No effect of the intensive systolic blood pressure management strategy was found on ICH occurrence or functional outcome according to CSVD burden. BPV was associated with higher odds of ICH in patients with CMBs and worse outcome in patients with moderate-to-severe WMHs.","['blood pressure', 'disability', 'endovascular therapy', 'stroke', 'thrombectomy']",2022-11-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36852441,"Srs11-92, a ferrostatin-1 analog, improves oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via Nrf2 signal following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.","Ferroptosis is increasingly becoming to be considered as an important mechanism of pathological cell death during stroke, and specific exogenous ferroptosis inhibitors have the ability to reverse cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, research on Srs11-92 (AA9), a ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) analog, in preclinical studies is limited.In the middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO/R) mice model or oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) cell model, Fer-1, AA9, and/or ML385 were administered, and brain infarct size, neurological deficits, neuronal damage, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation were determined after the damage, in vitro and in vivo.Fer-1 and AA9 improved brain infarct size, neuronal damage, and neurological deficits in mice model of MCAO/R, and inhibited the overloaded iron deposition, ROS accumulation, and neuroinflammation response: it also increased the expression of GPx4, Nrf2, and HO-1 and suppressed the expression of HMGB1 and NF-κB p65 in the epicenter of injured hippocampal formation. However, Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 reversed the neuroprotective effect of AA9, including the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In vitro studies showed that AA9 relieved OGD/R-induced neuronal oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via the Nrf2 pathway, which was impaired by ML385 in primary neurons.The findings imply that Fer-1 analog AA9 may be suitable for further translational studies for the protection of neuronal damage via Nrf2 signal pathway-mediated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in stroke and others neurological diseases.","['Srs11-92', 'ferroptosis', 'ischemic stroke', 'neuroinflammation', 'oxidative stress']",2022-11-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36852300,DNase I and Sivelestat Ameliorate Experimental Hindlimb Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Eliminating Neutrophil Extracellular Traps.,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play an important role in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of the hindlimb. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of recombinant DNase I and sivelestat in eliminating NETs and their effects on IRI limbs.An air pump was used to apply a pressure of 300 mmHg to the root of the right hindlimb of the rat for 2 h and then deflated to replicate the IRI model. The formation of NETs was determined by the detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and histone H3 in the skeletal muscles of the hindlimbs. Animals were administered 2.5 mg/kg bw/d DNase I, 15 or 60 mg/kg bw/d sivelestat by injection into the tail vein or intramuscularly into the ischemic area for 7d. Elimination of NETs, hindlimb perfusion, muscle fibrosis, angiogenesis and motor function were assessed.DNase I reduced NETs, attenuated muscle fibrosis, promoted angiogenesis in IRI area and improved limb motor function. Local administration of DNase I improved hindlimb perfusion more than intravenous administration. Sivelestat at a dose of 15 mg/kg bw/d increased perfusion, counteracted skeletal muscle fibrosis, promoted angiogenesis and enhanced motor function. However, sivelestat at a dosage of 60 mg/kg bw/d had an adverse effect on tissue repair, especially when injected locally.Both DNase I and moderate doses of sivelestat can eliminate IRI-derived NETs. They improve hindlimb function by improving perfusion and angiogenesis, preventing muscle fibrosis. Appropriate administration mode and dosage is the key to prevent IRI by elimination of NETs. DNase I is more valid when administered topically and sivelestat is more effective when administered intravenously. These results will provide a better strategy for the treatment of IRI in clinical.","['DNase I', 'IRI', 'NETs', 'hindlimb', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'neutrophil extracellular traps', 'sivelestat']",2022-11-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36852112,Spatiotemporal profile of neutrophil extracellular trap formation in a mouse model of ischemic stroke.,"Thromboinflammatory processes modulate the complex pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in ischemic stroke, but the exact underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence indicates that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) might play an important role in the thromboinflammatory cascade. In addition, the link between von Willebrand factor (VWF) and neutrophil recruitment in the ischemic brain might promote thromboinflammation, possibly by the formation of NETs.To study NET formation in a murine model of cerebral I/R injury in ischemic stroke.The filament-induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model was used to induce 60 minutes of focal cerebral ischemia after which reperfusion was allowed. At different time points postischemia, NETs were identified in the ischemic mouse brain using quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy.NETs could be identified in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere. Interestingly, NETs could already be detected at 6 hours poststroke. Their presence increased at 12 hours, was highest at 24 hours, and decreased again 48 hours postischemia. Remarkably, NETs were predominantly localized within the brain vasculature postischemia, suggesting that NETs play a role in secondary microthrombosis. Strikingly, NET formation was significantly decreased in VWF-deficient mice compared to littermate wild-type mice 24 hours postischemia, indicating a possible role for VWF in promoting NETosis in the ischemic brain.This study identified the spatiotemporal profile of NET formation in a mouse model of cerebral I/R injury in ischemic stroke. NETs, potentially in combination with VWF, might be attractive targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in ischemic stroke treatment.","['Extracellular traps', 'ischemic stroke', 'reperfusion injury', 'thromboinflammation', 'von willebrand factor']",2022-10-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36849925,Predictors of outcome after endovascular treatment for tandem occlusions: a single center retrospective analysis.,"The endovascular treatment procedure in tandem occlusions (TO) is complex compared to single occlusion (SO) and optimal management remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to identify clinical and procedural factors that may be associated to efficacy and safety in the management of TO and compare functional outcome in TO and SO stroke patients.This is a retrospective single center study of medium (MeVO) and large vessel occlusion (LVO) of the anterior circulation. Clinical, imaging, and interventional data were analyzed to identify predictive factors for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and functional outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT) in TO. Functional outcome in TO and SO patients was compared.Of 662 anterior circulation stroke patients with MeVO and LVO stroke, 90 (14%) had TO. Stenting was performed in 73 (81%) of TO patients. Stent thromboses occurred in 8 (11%) patients. Successful reperfusion with modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) ≥ 2b was achieved in 82 (91%). SICH occurred in seven (8%). The strongest predictors for sICH were diabetes mellitus and number of stent retriever passes. Good functional clinical outcome (mRS ≤ 2) at 90-day follow up was similar in TO and SO patients (58% vs 59% respectively). General anesthesia (GA) was associated with good functional outcome whereas hemorrhage in the infarcted tissue, lower mTICI score and history of smoking were associated with poor outcome.The risk of sICH was increased in patients with diabetes mellitus and those with extra stent-retriever attempts. Functional clinical outcomes in patients with TO were comparable to patients with SO.","['Diabetes', 'Endovascular therapy', 'Stenting', 'Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'Tandem occlusions', 'Thrombectomy']",2022-06-09,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36849103,Galangin alleviated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by enhancing autophagic flux and inhibiting inflammation.,"Autophagy is critically involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Autophagy inhibition exacerbates myocardial I/R injury. Few effective agents target autophagy to prevent myocardial I/R injury. Effective drugs that promote autophagy in myocardial I/R warrant further investigation. Galangin (Gal) enhances autophagy and alleviates I/R injury. Here we conducted both in vivo and in vitro experiments to observe the changes in autophagy after galangin treatment and investigated the cardioprotective effects of galangin on myocardial I/R.After 45-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, myocardial I/R was induced by slipknot release. One day before surgery and immediately after surgery, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with the same volume of saline or Gal. The effects of Gal were evaluated using echocardiography, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (TTC staining), western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy. Primary cardiomyocytes and bone marrow-derived macrophages were extracted in vitro to measure the cardioprotective effects of Gal.Compared with the saline-treated group, Gal significantly improved cardiac function and limited infarct enlargement after myocardial I/R. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that Gal treatment promoted autophagy during myocardial I/R. The anti-inflammatory effects of Gal were validated in bone marrow-derived macrophages. These results strongly suggest that Gal treatment can attenuate myocardial I/R injury.Our data demonstrated that Gal could improve left ventricular ejection fraction and reduce infarct size after myocardial I/R by promoting autophagy and inhibiting inflammation.","['Autophagy', 'Galangin', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion']",2022-11-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36848390,Differences between cardiac Troponin I versus T according to the duration of myocardial ischemia.,"Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) are expressed as an obligate 1:1 complex in the myocardium. However, blood levels of cTnI often rise much higher than cTnT in myocardial infarction (MI), whereas cTnT is often higher in patients with stable conditions such as atrial fibrillation. Here we examine hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT after different durations of experimental cardiac ischemia.hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT, and the hs-cTnT/hs-cTnI ratio were measured in plasma samples from rats before and at 30 and 120 minutes after 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes of myocardial ischemia. The animals were killed after 120 minutes of reperfusion, and the infarct volume and volume at risk were measured. hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT, and the hs-cTnT/hs-cTnI ratio were also measured in plasma samples collected from patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction.hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI increased over ten-fold in all rats subjected to ischemia. The increase of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT after 30 minutes was similar, resulting in a hs-cTnI/hs-cTnT ratio around 1. The hs-cTnI/hs-cTnT ratio was also around 1 in blood samples collected at 120 minutes in rats subjected to 5 or 10 minutes of ischemia where no localized necrosis was observed. In contrast, the hs-cTnI/hs-cTnT ratio at 2 hours was 3.6-5.5 after longer ischemia that induced cardiac necrosis. The large hs-cTnI/hs-cTnT ratio was confirmed in patients with anterior STEMI.Both hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT increased similarly after brief periods of ischemia that did not cause overt necrosis, whereas the hs-cTnI/hs-cTnT ratio tended to increase following longer ischemia that induced substantial necrosis. A low hs-cTnI/hs-cTnT ratio around 1 may signify non-necrotic cTn release.","['Biomarkers', 'Cardiac troponin', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Myocardial ischemia']",2022-11-14,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36848171,Remote ischemic conditioning-induced hyperacute and acute responses of plasma proteome in healthy young male adults: a quantitative proteomic analysis.,"Long-term remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) has been proven to be beneficial in multiple diseases, such as cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. However, the hyperacute and acute effects of a single RIC stimulus are still not clear. Quantitative proteomic analyses of plasma proteins following RIC application have been conducted in preclinical and clinical studies but exhibit high heterogeneity in results due to wide variations in experimental setups and sampling procedures. Hence, this study aimed to explore the immediate effects of RIC on plasma proteome in healthy young adults to exclude confounding factors of disease entity, such as medications and gender.Young healthy male participants were enrolled after a systematic physical examination and 6-month lifestyle observation. Individual RIC sessions included five cycles of alternative ischemia and reperfusion, each lasting for 5 min in bilateral forearms. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 5 min after RIC, and 2 h after RIC, and then samples were processed for proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method.Proteins related to lipid metabolism (e.g., Apolipoprotein F), coagulation factors (hepatocyte growth factor activator preproprotein), members of complement cascades (mannan-binding lectin serine protease 1 isoform 2 precursor), and inflammatory responses (carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain precursor) were differentially altered at their serum levels following the RIC intervention. The most enriched pathways were protein glycosylation and complement/coagulation cascades.One-time RIC stimulus may induce instant cellular responses like anti-inflammation, coagulation, and fibrinolysis balancing, and lipid metabolism regulation which are protective in different perspectives. Protective effects of single RIC in hyperacute and acute phases may be exploited in clinical emergency settings due to apparently beneficial alterations in plasma proteome profile. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of long-term (repeated) RIC interventions in preventing chronic cardiovascular diseases among general populations can also be expected based on our study findings.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36847368,Real-Time Monitoring and Modulation of Blood Pressure in a Rabbit Model of Ischemic Stroke.,"Control of blood pressure, in terms of both absolute values and its variability, affects outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. However, it remains challenging to identify the mechanisms that lead to poor outcomes or evaluate measures by which these effects can be mitigated because of the prohibitive limitations inherent to human data. In such cases, animal models can be utilized to conduct rigorous and reproducible evaluations of diseases. Here we report refinement of a previously described model of ischemic stroke in rabbits that is augmented with continuous blood pressure recording to assess the impacts of modulation on blood pressure. Under general anesthesia, femoral arteries are exposed through surgical cutdowns to place arterial sheaths bilaterally. Under fluoroscopic visualization and roadmap guidance, a microcatheter is advanced into an artery of the posterior circulation of the brain. An angiogram is performed by injecting the contralateral vertebral artery to confirm occlusion of the target artery. With the occlusive catheter remaining in position for a fixed duration, blood pressure is continuously recorded to allow for tight titration of blood pressure manipulations, whether through mechanical or pharmacological means. At the completion of the occlusion interval, the microcatheter is removed, and the animal is maintained under general anesthesia for a prescribed length of reperfusion. For acute studies, the animal is then euthanized and decapitated. The brain is harvested and processed to measure the infarct volume under light microscopy and further assessed with various histopathological stains or spatial transcriptomic analysis. This protocol provides a reproducible model that can be utilized for more thorough preclinical studies on the effects of blood pressure parameters during ischemic stroke. It also facilitates effective preclinical evaluation of novel neuroprotective interventions that might improve care for ischemic stroke patients.",[],,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36846323,Enhancing the expression of a key mitochondrial enzyme at the inception of ischemia-reperfusion injury can boost recovery and halt the progression of acute kidney injury.,"Hydrodynamic fluid delivery has shown promise in influencing renal function in disease models. This technique provided pre-conditioned protection in acute injury models by upregulating the mitochondrial adaptation, while hydrodynamic injections of saline alone have improved microvascular perfusion. Accordingly, hydrodynamic mitochondrial gene delivery was applied to investigate the ability to halt progressive or persistent renal function impairment following episodes of ischemia-reperfusion injuries known to induce acute kidney injury (AKI). The rate of transgene expression was approximately 33% and 30% in rats with prerenal AKI that received treatments 1 (T1hr) and 24 (T24hr) hours after the injury was established, respectively. The resulting mitochondrial adaptation via exogenous IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (NADP+) and mitochondrial) significantly blunted the effects of injury within 24 h of administration: decreased serum creatinine (≈60%, p < 0.05 at T1hr; ≈50%, p < 0.05 at T24hr) and blood urea nitrogen (≈50%, p < 0.05 at T1hr; ≈35%, p < 0.05 at T24hr) levels, and increased urine output (≈40%, p < 0.05 at T1hr; ≈26%, p < 0.05 at T24hr) and mitochondrial membrane potential, Δψm, (≈ by a factor of 13, p < 0.001 at T1hr; ≈ by a factor of 11, p < 0.001 at T24hr), despite elevated histology injury score (26%, p < 0.05 at T1hr; 47%, p < 0.05 at T24hr). Therefore, this study identifies an approach that can boost recovery and halt the progression of AKI at its inception.","['IDH2 [isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (NADP+) and mitochondrial]', 'gene delivery, acute kidney injury', 'hydrodynamic gene delivery', 'hydrodynamic injections', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R)']",2022-08-21,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36846247,Concentrations and kinetics of renal biomarkers in dogs with gastric dilatation-volvulus with and without 24-h intravenous lidocaine.,"Gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) can lead to organ failure including acute kidney injury (AKI). Due to its cytoprotective, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, lidocaine has a potential to prevent AKI in dogs with GDV.Prospective, observational cohort study in client-owned dogs with GDV.To determine concentrations of renal biomarkers for AKI in dogs with GDV with and without intravenous (IV) lidocaine therapy.Thirty-two dogs were randomized to receive either IV lidocaine (2 mg/kg, followed by a lidocaine constant rate infusion at a dose of 50 μg/kg/min over 24 h; n = 17) or no lidocaine (n = 15). Blood and urine samples were taken at admission (T 0) (only blood), during or immediately after surgery (T 1), and 24 (T 24) and 48 (T 48) h after surgery. Plasma creatinine (pCr), plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (pNGAL), urinary NGAL (uNGAL), uNGAL to creatinine ratio (UNCR), and urinary gamma-glutamyl transferase to creatinine ratio (uGGT/uCr) were evaluated. Biomarker concentrations were compared between dogs with and without IV lidocaine and the course of each marker was determined in comparison to its admission value.In the entire population, a significantly higher pCr at T 0 (median, 95 μmol/L, interquartile range, 82-105) compared with T 1 (69 μmol/L, 60-78), T 24 (63 μmol/L, 52-78), and T 48 (78 μmol/L, 65-87) (P < 0.001) was found. Plasma NGAL increased significantly between T 0 (5.66 ng/mL, 3.58-7.43) and T 24 (7.50 ng/mL, 4.01-11.89) (P = 0.006) and T 48 (9.86 ng/mL, 5.52-13.92) (P < 0.001), respectively. Urinary NGAL increased significantly between T 1 (0.61 ng/mL, 0.30-2.59) and T 24 (2.62 ng/mL, 1.86-10.92) (P = 0.001) and T 48 (4.79 ng/mL, 1.96-34.97 (P < 0.001), respectively. UNCR increased significantly between T 1 (0.15 μg/mmol, 0.09-0.54) and T 24 (1.14 μg/mmol, 0.41-3.58) (P = 0.0015) and T 48 (1.34 μg/mmol, 0.30-7.42) (P < 0.001), respectively. Concentrations of uGGT/uCr increased significantly from T 0 highest at T 24 (6.20 U/mmol, 3.90-9.90) and significantly decreased at T 48 (3.76 U/mmol, 2.84-6.22) (P < 0.001). No significant differences in any renal biomarker concentration were found between dogs with and without IV lidocaine therapy.Plasma NGAL, uNGAL and UNCR remained increased up to 48 h post-surgery. No evidence of lidocaine-associated renoprotection was found.","['AKI', 'canine gastric torsion', 'ischemia-reperfusion', 'lidocaine', 'organoprotection', 'renal biomarker']",2022-12-04,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36846202,Circular RNA_HIPK3-Targeting miR-93-5p Regulates KLF9 Expression Level to Control Acute Kidney Injury.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical syndrome caused by various reasons that results in the rapid decline of renal function in a short period of time. Severe AKI can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Circular RNA HIPK3 (circHIPK3) derived from the HIPK3 gene is involved in multiple inflammatory processes. The present research was performed to explore the function of circHIPK3 on AKI. The AKI model was established by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in C57BL/6 mice or hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in HK-2 cells. The function and mechanism of circHIPK3 on AKI were explored via biochemical index measurement; hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT); flow cytometry; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); western blot; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR); detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP); and luciferase reporter assays. circHIPK3 was upregulated in kidney tissues of I/R-induced mice and in H/R-treated HK-2 cells, while the microRNA- (miR-) 93-5p level was decreased in H/R-stimulated HK-2 cells. Furthermore, circHIPK3 silencing or miR-93-5p overexpression could reduce the level of proinflammatory factors and oxidative stress and recover the cell viability in H/R-stimulated HK-2 cells. Meanwhile, the luciferase assay showed that Krüppel-like transcription factor 9 (KLF9) was the downstream target of miR-93-5p. Forced expression of KLF9 blocked the function of miR-93-5p on H/R-treated HK-2 cells. Knockdown of circHIPK3 improved the renal function and reduced the apoptosis level in vivo. In conclusion, circHIPK3 knockdown alleviated oxidative stress and apoptosis and inhibited inflammation in AKI via miR-93-5p-mediated downregulation of the KLF9 signal pathway.",[],2022-08-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

36846057,Anti-inflammatory effects of oral and intraperitoneal administration of cerium oxide nanoparticles on experimental hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury occurs in liver surgery, resection, and transplantation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced following IR starts the cascade of cell damage, necrosis/apoptosis, and proinflammatory responses by activating intracellular signaling cascade to drive hepatocellular damage. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CONPs) act as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents. Thus, we evaluated the protective effects of oral (o.g.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of CONPs on hepatic IR injury.Mice were randomly divided into five groups: control, sham, IR protocol, CONP+IR (i.p.), and CONP+IR (o.g.). Mouse hepatic IR protocol was applied to the animals in the IR group. CONPs (300 μg/kg) were administered 24 hours before IR protocol. Blood and tissue samples were taken after the reperfusion period.Hepatic IR injury markedly increased enzyme activities, tissue lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase (MPO), xanthine oxidase (XO), nitrite oxide (NO), and tissue nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65 levels, plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules while decreasing antioxidant markers and caused pathological changes in hepatic tissue. The expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and 9 increased, and tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) expression decreased in the IR group. Pretreatment with CONPs o.g. and i.p. 24 hours before hepatic ischemia improved the biochemical parameters above and alleviated the histopathological findings.Results of the present study demonstrate a significant reduction in liver degeneration by administering CONPs via i.p. and o.g. route in an experimental liver IR model, suggesting that CONPs have the extensive potential to prevent hepatic IR injury.","['Ischemia reperfusion', 'cerium oxide nanoparticles (CONPs)', 'inflammation', 'mouse', 'oxidative stress']",2021-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36845012,Identify Key Genes Correlated to Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in Aging Livers.,"With the intensification of population aging, the proportion of aging livers in the donor pool is increasing rapidly. Compared with young livers, aging livers are more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) during liver transplantation, which greatly affects the utilization rate of aging livers. The potential risk factors associated with IRI in aging livers have not been fully elucidated.In this work, five human liver tissue expression profiling datasets (GSE61260, GSE107037, GSE89632, GSE133815, and GSE151648) and a total of 28 young and aging liver tissues of human (N = 20) and mouse (N = 8) were used to screen and verify the potential risk factors associated with aging livers being more prone to IRI. DrugBank Online was used to screen drugs with potential to alleviate IRI in aging livers.The gene expression profile and immune cell composition between young and aging livers had significant differences. Among the differentially expressed genes, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL), BTG antiproliferation factor 2 (BTG2), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), immediate early response 3 (IER3), Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FOS), and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A), mainly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation, were also dysregulated in liver tissues suffered from IRI and could form a FOS-centered interaction network. Nadroparin was screened out with the potential to target FOS in DrugBank Online. In addition, the proportion of dendritic cells (DCs) was significantly upregulated in aging livers.We combined the expression profiling datasets of liver tissues and samples collected in our hospital for the first time to reveal that the changes in the expression of ARNTL, BTG2, CXCL10, CHI3L1, IER3, FOS, and PPARGC1A and the proportion of dendritic cells may be associated with aging livers being more prone to IRI.

36845011,miR-9a-5p Protects Ischemic Stroke by Regulating Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Autophagy.,"Present research is aimed at exploring the effect of miR-9a-5p on mitochondrial autophagy and alleviating cellular oxidative stress injury in ischemic stroke.SH-SY5Y cells were cultured with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate ischemia/reperfusion. The cells were treated in an anaerobic incubator (95% N2, 5% CO2) for 2 h and then reoxygenated in the normoxic condition for 24 h with 2 ml of normal medium. Cells were transfected with miR-9a-5p mimic/inhibitor or negative control. The RT-qPCR assay was utilized to measure the mRNA expression. Western blot was utilized to evaluate the protein expression. The CCK-8 assay was conducted to detect cell viability. Flow cytometry was applied to examine apoptosis and the cell cycle. The ELISA assay was applied to measure the contents of SOD and MDA in mitochondria. Autophagosomes were observed via electron microscopy.By comparison with the control group, the miR-9a-5p expression in the OGD/R group obviously declined. Mitochondrial crista breaks, vacuole-like changes, and increased autophagosome formation were observed in the OGD/R group. OGD/R injury enhanced oxidative stress damage and mitophagy. When transfected with the miR-9a-5p mimic, mitophagosome production of SH-SY5Y cells decreased and oxidative stress injury was inhibited.

Nephrectomy of the right kidney was performed on the IRI rat model that was subjected to 60 min of left renal pedicle occlusion followed by 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion. The wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio of lung, levels of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- β and tumor necrosis factor- α, and biomarkers of oxidative stress such as superoxide dismutase, malonaldehyde (MDA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), were assayed. Histological examinations were conducted to determine damage of tissues in the kidney and lung. The protein expressions of light chain 3 II/light chain 3 I (LC3-II/LC3-I), uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1), P62, AMPK and mTOR were measured by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively.The renal IRI induced pulmonary injury following AKI, resulting in significant increases in W/D ratio of lung, and the levels of Scr, BUN, inflammatory cytokines, MDA and MPO (P<0.01); all of these were reduced in the CS groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Compared with the IRI groups, the expression levels of P62 and mTOR were significantly lower (P<0.05 or P<0.01), while those of LC3-II/LC3-I, ULK1, and AMPK were significantly higher in the CS2 group (P<0.05 or P<0.01).CS had a potential in treating lung injury following renal IRI through activation of the autophagy-related AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway in AKI-induced ALI.","['Chinese medicine', 'Cordyceps sinensis', 'acute kidney injury', 'acute lung injury', 'autophagy', 'ischemic reperfusion injury']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36842993,Sevoflurane Postconditioning Attenuates Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Inhibiting SP1/ACSL4-Mediated Ferroptosis.,"Sevoflurane is the most commonly used anesthetic in clinical practice and exerts a protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which sevoflurane postconditioning protects against cerebral I/R injury. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in vitro and the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in vivo were established to simulate cerebral I/R injury. Sevoflurane postconditioning reduced neurological deficits, cerebral infarction, and ferroptosis after I/R injury. Interestingly, sevoflurane significantly inhibited specificity protein 1 (SP1) expression in MACO rats and HT22 cells exposed to OGD/R. SP1 overexpression attenuated the neuroprotective effects of sevoflurane on OGD/R-treated HT22 cells, evidenced by reduced cell viability, increased apoptosis, and cleaved caspase-3 expression. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase experiments verified that SP1 bound directly to the ACSL4 promoter region to increase its expression. In addition, sevoflurane inhibited ferroptosis via SP1/ACSL4 axis. Generally, our study describes an anti-ferroptosis effect of sevoflurane against cerebral I/R injury via downregulating the SP1/ASCL4 axis. These findings suggest a novel sight for cerebral protection against cerebral I/R injury and indicate a potential therapeutic approach for a variety of cerebral diseases.","['cerebral ischemia-reperfusion', 'ferroptosis', 'sevoflurane', 'specificity protein 1']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

The optimal timing and treatment option remain debatable in the absence of randomized controlled trials. Percutaneous device closure is a well-reported and less invasive treatment option but recent imaging studies indicate that majority of defects are too large to be adequately covered by the currently Conformite Europeenne and Food and Drug Administration approved occluder devices.Six patients presented with large and complex postinfarct ventricular septal ruptures, considered unsuitable for the Amplatzer post-infarct ventricular septal defect Occluder, so were treated using the prototype Occlutech® 36 mm PI-VSD occluder, including the first-in-human use.The prototype device was successfully deployed in all patients with satisfactory immediate results and shunt reduction. Three patients (50%) in cardiogenic shock did not survive beyond discharge, of which two were complicated by device dislodgement or embolization.Percutaneous closure of large postinfarct ventricular septal ruptures is possible using newer device with a wider coverage.

36841811,MiR-130a-3p regulates FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy by targeting GJA1 in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.,"Understanding the complex pathogenesis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (IRI) is an urgent problem in clinical trials. Increasing pieces of evidence have suggested that miRNAs are involved in the occurrence and development of heart diseases by regulating mitochondria-related gene expression. Mitochondria have been acknowledged as the key triggers of cardiac I/R injury. However, the potential impact of miR-130a on mitochondria remains unclear in myocardial IRI. Exploring the regulatory mechanism of miR-130a on mitochondria may provide a new target for IRI therapy. In the present study, we found that miR-130a significantly increased in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and myocardial I/R rats. MiR-130a could downregulate the viability of cardiomyocytes and the knockdown of miR-130a could protect the viability of cardiomyocytes under hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR). Over-expression of miR-130a resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction. It was evidenced by decreases in mitochondrial ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, suppression of miR-130a could protect against mitochondrial damage, show elevation of mitochondrial ATP production rate and MMP, and reduce ROS production. We further explored the effect of miR-130a on the mitochondrial quality control (QMC) system by determining mitochondrial-protein-specific proteases and analyzed mitochondrial morphology by fluorescence imaging and electron microscopy, respectively. It was noted that miR-130a could suppress mitochondrial fusion and FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy to accelerate myocardial IRI. Moreover, we investigated the potential miR-130a targeted mitochondria-related genes to understand the regulatory mechanism of miR-130a in the setting of myocardial IRI. It was revealed that miR-130a targeted GJA1, and GJA1 rescued IRI by enhancing ATP production rate and oxidative phosphorylation, meanwhile protecting cell viability, MMP, and activating mitophagy. In addition, the knockdown of miR-130a significantly activated FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy, while the knockdown of GJA1 reversed the relevant response. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-130a regulates FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy by targeting GJA1 in myocardial IRI.",[],2022-11-17,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36841376,Protective effect and underlying mechanism of muscone on acute cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.,"Musk is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine, which has resuscitation, activating blood, and disperse swelling effects. Musk is commonly used in the prevention of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, and muscone is its main active component.The effect and mechanism of muscone to improve the condition of ischemic stroke is not clear, accordingly, we verified its efficacy in ischemia-reperfused rats, and investigated its mechanism by PC12 and THP-1 cells.A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) rat model was established for in vivo experiments. 2,3,5-Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining was used to calculate infarct rate. Neuroprotection and angiogenesis were assessed by Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, nissl staining, immunofluorescence staining, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Oxygen glucose deprivation-reperfusion (OGD/R) model of PC12 cells was established for neuroprotection analysis, where CCK-8 assay was used to measure cell viability, flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining were used to demonstrate apoptosis, and protein levels were detected by Western blot. For angiogenesis analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and qRT-PCR were used to detect angiogenic factors expressed by THP-1. Cell viability assay, scratch wound assay, and tube formation assay were used to evaluate angiogenic effect of HUVECs treated with medium of THP-1. And the angiogenic pathway in HUVECs was detected by Western blot.According to the results, in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion rats, the infarct rate and tissue damage were significantly reduced by muscone, and the expression of neurotrophic factors and angiogenesis-related factors were all elevated. In OGD/R-PC12 cell models, muscone could increase cell viability and inhibit apoptosis via Bax/Bcl-2/Caspase-3 pathway. In THP-1-mediated angiogenesis of HUVECs, muscone promoted the secretion of angiogenesis-related factors in THP-1 and thus indirectly promoted the proliferation, migration and tube formation of HUVECs, and then regulated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and Akt in HUVECs.Our study indicated that muscone may be a potential neuroprotective and proangiogenic agent in cerebral ischemia.","['Angiogenesis', 'Cerebral ischemia', 'Macrophages', 'Muscone', 'Neuronal apoptosis']",2022-10-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36841283,Coumarin-derived imino sulfonate 5h ameliorates cardiac injury induced by myocardial infarction via activating the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is irreversible damage caused by ischemia and hypoxia in coronary arteries accompanied by elevated catecholamine levels, leading to the accumulation of free radicals. Our previous study discovered coumarin-derived imino sulfonates as a novel class of potential cardioprotective agents possessing strong anti-oxidative effects in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, identifying the compound with the highest cardioprotective activity, 5h, and the mechanism involved was necessary. As a kind of catecholamine, isoproterenol can clinically induce myocardial infarction injury similar to the symptoms of myocardial infarction patients. Our experiments explored the underlying mechanism of this effect of compound 5h by assessing cardiac function, infarct size, histopathological changes, and downregulation of Sirt1 by transfection of adenovirus in vitro and by administering Ex527, a specific inhibitor of Sirt1, in vivo. Compound 5h exhibited strong cardioprotective actions in vivo and in vitro via improving cell survival and cardiac function and decreasing the cellular oxidative stress and cardiac infarct size against MI. Furthermore, compound 5h significantly enhanced cardiac expression of Sirt1, subsequently activating the Nrf2/NQO1 signaling pathway. However, adenovirus-induced Sirt1 downregulation or Sirt1-specific inhibitor largely blocked such beneficial effects of 5h in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Taken together, our results demonstrated, for the first time, that the cardioprotective action of 5h against MI was mediated by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis through the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Our findings proposed novel insights in developing and evaluating coumarin-derived imino sulfonate compounds as epigenetics-targeted drug therapy for MI.","['Coumarin-derived imino sulfonate', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Nrf2', 'Oxidative stress', 'Sirt1']",2022-10-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36840630,Malic Enzyme 1 as a Novel Anti-Ferroptotic Regulator in Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,"Ferroptosis has been linked to the pathogenesis of hepatic injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, the mechanistic basis remains unclear. In this study, by using a mouse model of hepatic I/R injury, it is observed that glutathione (GSH) and cysteine depletion are associated with deficiency of the reducing power of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Genes involved in maintaining NADPH homeostasis are screened, and it is identified that I/R-induced hepatic ferroptosis is significantly associated with reduced expression and activity of NADP+ -dependent malic enzyme 1 (Me1). Mice with hepatocyte-specific Me1 gene deletion exhibit aggravated ferroptosis and liver injury under I/R treatment; while supplementation with L-malate, the substrate of ME1, restores NADPH and GSH levels and eventually inhibits I/R-induced hepatic ferroptosis and injury. A mechanistic study further reveals that downregulation of hepatic Me1 expression is largely mediated by the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-dependent suppression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin/sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (mTOR/SREBP1) signaling pathway in hepatic I/R model. Finally, PTEN inhibitor, mTOR activator, or SREBP1 over-expression all increase hepatic NADPH, block ferroptosis, and protect liver against I/R injury. Taken together, the findings suggest that targeting ME1 may provide new therapeutic opportunities for I/R injury and other ferroptosis-related hepatic conditions.","['ferroptosis', 'hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'malate', 'malic enzyme 1', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate']",2022-09-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36840496,Syringin exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by regulating SIRT1 signaling in rat and cell models of acute myocardial infarction.,"This study aimed to investigate the role of syringin in improving heart function during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and to determine whether the sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (SIRT1/PGC-1α) pathway contributes to this cardioprotective effect in vivo and in vitro.H9c2 cells were incubated with H2 O2 for 12 h. The effect of syringin was assessed by measuring cell viability; the apoptotic rate; Keap1/NRF2/HO-1 activation; and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative products, and antioxidative enzymes. In addition, SIRT1 was silenced via short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-SIRT1 transfection to evaluate its involvement in syringin-mediated protection. Syringin rescued cells from H2 O2 -induced reductions in viability, antioxidative enzyme levels, and NRF2/HO-1 activation; likewise, syringin inhibited apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. We also created a rat model of I/R by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 12 min. Syringin was then intraperitoneally injected, and the effect on infarct size and cardiac function was examined after 7 days. NRF2/HO-1 activity and the levels of myocardial proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative products, and antioxidative enzymes were measured.In comparison to the untreated I/R group, the syringin treatment group exhibited improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac lesion and infarct size. Syringin administration also markedly reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species and promoted antioxidative enzyme expression and NRF2/HO-1 pathway activation.Syringin may serve a protective role in animal and cell models of I/R by improving cardiac function, inhibiting the inflammatory response, and activating the antioxidative response.","['SIRT1', 'inflammation', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion', 'oxidative stress', 'syringing']",2022-10-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36839407,Ursolic Acid Ameliorates Myocardial Ischaemia/Reperfusion Injury by Improving Mitochondrial Function via Immunoproteasome-PP2A-AMPK Signalling.,"Cardiac ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ursolic acid (UA), as a pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic acid, exerts several bioactivities in animal models of different diseases, but the preventive role of UA in I/R-induced myocardial dysfunction remains largely unknown. Male wild-type mice were pre-administered with UA at a dosage of 80 mg/kg i.p. and then subjected to cardiac I/R injury for 24 h. Cardiac function and pathological changes were examined by echocardiography and histological staining. The protein and mRNA levels of the genes were determined using qPCR and immunoblotting analysis. Our results revealed that UA administration in mice significantly attenuated the I/R-induced decline in cardiac function, infarct size, myocyte apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, UA increased three immunoproteasome catalytic subunit expressions and activities, which promoted ubiquitinated PP2A degradation and activated AMPK-PGC1α signalling, leading to improved mitochondrial biosynthesis and dynamic balance. In vitro experiments confirmed that UA treatment prevented hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R)-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction through activation of AMPK signalling. In summary, our findings identify UA as a new activator of the immunoproteasome that exerts a protective role in I/R-induced myocardial dysfunction and suggest that UA supplementation could be beneficial for the prevention of cardiac ischaemic disease.","['AMPK', 'PP2A', 'immunoproteasome', 'mitochondrial function', 'myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion', 'ursolic acid']",2023-02-06,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36836232,Cardioplegia in Open Heart Surgery: Age Matters.,"Cardioplegia is a pharmacological approach essential for the protection of the heart from ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Over the years, numerous cardioplegic solutions have been developed, with each cardioplegic approach having its advantages and disadvantages. Cardioplegic solutions can be divided into crystalloid and blood cardioplegic solutions, and an experienced surgeon chooses the type of solution based on the individual needs of patients in order to provide optimal heart protection. Importantly, the pediatric immature myocardium is structurally, physiologically, and metabolically different from the adult heart, and consequently its needs to achieve cardioplegic arrest strongly differ. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide a summary of the cardioplegic solutions available to pediatric patients with a special focus on emphasizing differences in heart injury after various cardioplegic solutions, the dosing strategies, and regimens.The PubMed database was searched using the terms cardioplegia, I-R, and pediatric population, and studies that investigated the influence of cardioplegic strategies on markers of cardiac muscle damage were further analyzed in this review.A large body of evidence suggested more prominent benefits achieved with blood compared to those with crystalloid cardioplegia in pediatric myocardium preservation. However, standardized and uniform protocols have not been established so far, and an experienced surgeon chooses the type of cardioplegia solution based on the individual needs of patients, while the severity of myocardial damage strongly depends on the type and duration of the surgical procedure, overall patient condition, and presence of comorbidities, etc.","['cardioplegia', 'ischemia–reperfusion', 'pediatric population']",2023-01-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36836225,Association of Serum BAFF Levels with Cardiovascular Events in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,"The B cell activating factor (BAFF) is a B cell survival factor involved in atherosclerosis and ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. This study sought to investigate whether BAFF is a potential predictor of poor outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).We prospectively enrolled 299 patients with STEMI, and serum levels of BAFF were measured. All subjects were followed for three years. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including cardiovascular death, nonfatal reinfarction, hospitalization for heart failure (HF), and stroke. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to analyze the predictive value of BAFF for MACEs.In multivariate analysis, BAFF was independently associated with risk of MACEs (adjusted HR 1.525, 95% CI 1.085-2.145; p = 0.015) and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.632, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.132-11.650, p = 0.030) after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with BAFF levels above the cut-off value (1.46 ng/mL) were more likely to have MACEs (log-rank p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular death (log-rank p < 0.0001). In subgroup analysis, the impact of high BAFF on MACEs development was stronger in patients without dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the C-statistic and Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) values for MACEs were improved with BAFF as an independent risk factor or when combined with cardiac troponin I.This study suggests that higher BAFF levels in the acute phase are an independent predictor of the incidence of MACEs in patients with STEMI.","['B cell activating factor', 'acute myocardial infarction', 'prognosis']",2023-01-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36836038,The Possibility of IPC to Prevent Ischemic-Reperfusion Injury in Skeletal Muscle in a Rat.,"Blood removal with air tourniquets for a long time induces muscle damage after reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has a protective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle and myocardium. However, the mechanism of action of IPC on skeletal muscle injury is unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect of IPC in reducing skeletal muscle damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion injury. The hindlimbs of 6-month-old rats were wounded with air tourniquets at a carminative blood pressure of 300 mmHg on the thighs. Rats were divided into the IPC (-) group and the IPC (+) group. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) were investigated by protein levels. Quantitative analysis of apoptosis was performed using the TUNEL method. Compared with the IPC (-) group, the IPC (+) group retained the VEGF expression, and the COX-2 and 8-OHdG expressions were suppressed. The proportion of apoptosis cells decreased in the IPC (+) group compared with the IPC (-) group. IPC in skeletal muscles proliferated VEGF and suppressed inflammatory response and oxidative DNA damage. IPC has the potential to reduce muscle damage after ischemia-reperfusion.","['8-hydroxyguanosine', 'apoptosis', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'ischemic preconditioning', 'reperfusion injury', 'vascular endothelial growth factor']",2023-01-11,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Rodent studies show that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a major regulator of renal hemodynamics and IR injury; however, its clinical relevance remains to be established. Here, we assessed the clinical changes in systemic endocannabinoid (eCB) levels induced by surgical renal IR. Sixteen patients undergoing on-clamp PN were included, with blood samples taken before renal ischemia, after 10 min of ischemia time, and 10 min following blood reperfusion. Kidney function parameters (serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum glucose) and eCB levels were measured. Baseline levels and individual changes in response to IR were analyzed and correlation analyses were performed. The baseline levels of eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) were positively correlated with kidney dysfunction biomarkers. Unilateral renal ischemia increased BUN, sCr, and glucose, which remained elevated following renal reperfusion. Renal ischemia did not induce changes in eCB levels for all patients pooled together. Nevertheless, stratifying patients according to their body mass index (BMI) revealed a significant increase in N-acylethanolamines (anandamide, AEA; N-oleoylethanolamine, OEA; and N-palmitoylethanolamine, PEA) in the non-obese patients. No significant changes were found in obese patients who had higher N-acylethanolamines baseline levels, positively correlated with BMI, and more cases of post-surgery AKI. With the inefficiency of 'traditional' IR-injury 'preventive drugs', our data support future research on the role of the ECS and its manipulation in renal IR.","['N-acylethanolamines', 'endocannabinoids', 'partial nephrectomy', 'renal ischemia reperfusion']",2023-01-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36835514,Norepinephrine and Vasopressin in Hemorrhagic Shock: A Focus on Renal Hemodynamics.,"During hemorrhagic shock, blood loss causes a fall in blood pressure, decreases cardiac output, and, consequently, O2 transport. The current guidelines recommend the administration of vasopressors in addition to fluids to maintain arterial pressure when life-threatening hypotension occurs in order to prevent the risk of organ failure, especially acute kidney injury. However, different vasopressors exert variable effects on the kidney, depending on the nature and dose of the substance chosen as follows: Norepinephrine increases mean arterial pressure both via its α-1-mediated vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance and its β1-related increase in cardiac output. Vasopressin, through activation of V1-a receptors, induces vasoconstriction, thus increasing mean arterial pressure. In addition, these vasopressors have the following different effects on renal hemodynamics: Norepinephrine constricts both the afferent and efferent arterioles, whereas vasopressin exerts its vasoconstrictor properties mainly on the efferent arteriole. Therefore, this narrative review discusses the current knowledge of the renal hemodynamic effects of norepinephrine and vasopressin during hemorrhagic shock.","['hemodynamics', 'hemorrhagic shock', 'ischemia/reperfusion', 'kidney', 'norepinephrine', 'renal hemodynamics', 'renal perfusion', 'vasopressin', 'vasopressor']",2023-01-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36835281,Dunaliella salina Alga Protects against Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury by Attenuating TLR4 Signaling.,"Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is marked by rapid increase in inflammation and not only results in myocardial apoptosis but also compromises the myocardial function. Dunaliella salina (D. salina), a halophilic unicellular microalga, has been used as a provitamin A carotenoid supplement and color additive. Several studies have reported that D. salina extract could attenuate lipopolysaccharides-induced inflammatory effects and regulate the virus-induced inflammatory response in macrophages. However, the effects of D. salina on myocardial I/R injury remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the cardioprotection of D. salina extract in rats subjected to myocardial I/R injury that was induced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 1 h followed by 3 h of reperfusion. Compared with the vehicle group, the myocardial infarct size significantly decreased in rats that were pre-treated with D. salina. D. salina significantly attenuated the expressions of TLR4, COX-2 and the activity of STAT1, JAK2, IκB, NF-κB. Furthermore, D. salina significantly inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and the levels of Beclin-1, p62, LC3-I/II. This study is the first to report that the cardioprotective effects of D. salina may mediate anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities and decrease autophagy through the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway to antagonize myocardial I/R injury.","['Dunaliella salina', 'cardioprotection', 'inflammation', 'myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'toll-like receptor 4']",2022-08-10,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36835212,Lethal Caspase-1/4-Dependent Injury Occurs in the First Minutes of Coronary Reperfusion and Requires Calpain Activity.,"To study the relationship between caspase-1/4 and reperfusion injury, we measured infarct size (IS) in isolated mouse hearts undergoing 50 min global ischemia/2 h reperfusion. Starting VRT-043198 (VRT) at reperfusion halved IS. The pan-caspase inhibitor emricasan duplicated VRT's protection. IS in caspase-1/4-knockout hearts was similarly reduced, supporting the hypothesis that caspase-1/4 was VRT's only protective target. NLRC4 inflammasomes activate caspase-1. NLRC4 knockout hearts were not protected, eliminating NLRC4 as caspase-1/4's activator. The amount of protection that could be achieved by only suppressing caspase-1/4 activity was limited. In wild-type (WT) hearts, ischemic preconditioning (IPC) was as protective as caspase-1/4 inhibitors. Combining IPC and emricasan in these hearts or preconditioning caspase-1/4-knockout hearts produced an additive IS reduction, indicating that more protection could be achieved by combining treatments. We determined when caspase-1/4 exerted its lethal injury. Starting VRT after 10 min of reperfusion in WT hearts was no longer protective, revealing that caspase-1/4 inflicted its injury within the first 10 min of reperfusion. Ca++ influx at reperfusion might activate caspase-1/4. We tested whether Ca++-dependent soluble adenylyl cyclase (AC10) could be responsible. However, IS in AC10-/- hearts was not different from that in WT control hearts. Ca++-activated calpain has been implicated in reperfusion injury. Calpain could be releasing actin-bound procaspase-1 in cardiomyocytes, which would explain why caspase-1/4-related injury is confined to early reperfusion. The calpain inhibitor calpeptin duplicated emricasan's protection. Unlike IPC, adding calpain to emricasan offered no additional protection, suggesting that caspase-1/4 and calpain may share the same protective target.","['AC10', 'VRT-043198', 'calpain', 'cardioprotection', 'caspase-1', 'emricasan']",2022-12-15,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36835040,Matrix Metalloproteinases in Cardioembolic Stroke: From Background to Complications.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are endopeptidases participating in physiological processes of the brain, maintaining the blood-brain barrier integrity and playing a critical role in cerebral ischemia. In the acute phase of stroke activity, the expression of MMPs increase and is associated with adverse effects, but in the post-stroke phase, MMPs contribute to the process of healing by remodeling tissue lesions. The imbalance between MMPs and their inhibitors results in excessive fibrosis associated with the enhanced risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the main cause of cardioembolic strokes. MMPs activity disturbances were observed in the development of hypertension, diabetes, heart failure and vascular disease enclosed in CHA2DS2VASc score, the scale commonly used to evaluate the risk of thromboembolic complications risk in AF patients. MMPs involved in hemorrhagic complications of stroke and activated by reperfusion therapy may also worsen the stroke outcome. In the present review, we briefly summarize the role of MMPs in the ischemic stroke with particular consideration of the cardioembolic stroke and its complications. Moreover, we discuss the genetic background, regulation pathways, clinical risk factors and impact of MMPs on the clinical outcome.","['atrial fibrillation', 'matrix metalloproteinase', 'stroke', 'thrombembolism']",2022-11-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Current organ preservation strategies, such as static cold storage (SCS), are aimed at reducing IRI. However, prolonged SCS exacerbates IRI. Recent research has examined pre-treatment approaches to more effectively attenuate IRI. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third established member of a family of gaseous signaling molecules, has been shown to target the pathophysiology of IRI and thus appears to be a viable candidate that can overcome the transplant surgeon's enemy. This review discusses pre-treatment of renal grafts and other transplantable organs with H2S to mitigate transplantation-induced IRI in animal models of transplantation. In addition, ethical principles of pre-treatment and potential applications of H2S pre-treatment in the prevention of other IRI-associated conditions are discussed.","['hydrogen sulfide (H2S)', 'ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)', 'pre-treatment', 'sodium thiosulfate (STS)', 'solid organ transplantation (SOT)']",2023-01-05,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

Besides regulating circadian rhythm, RORα also influences a wide range of physiological and pathological processes in the cardiovascular system, including atherosclerosis, hypoxia or ischemia, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetic cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and myocardial hypertrophy. In terms of mechanism, RORα was involved in the regulation of inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial function. Besides natural ligands for RORα, several synthetic RORα agonists or antagonists have been developed. This review mainly summarizes protective roles and possible mechanisms of RORα against cardiovascular diseases. However, there are also several limitations and challenges of current research on RORα, especially the difficulties on the transformability from the bench to the bedside. By the aid of multidisciplinary research, breakthrough progress on RORα-related drugs to combat cardiovascular disorder may appear.","['agonist', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'ligand', 'retinoid-related orphan receptor α', 'staggerer mutant mice']",2022-11-02,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"

36834829,Advancing Stroke Research on Cerebral Thrombi with Omic Technologies.,"Cerebrovascular diseases represent a leading cause of disability, morbidity, and death worldwide. In the last decade, the advances in endovascular procedures have not only improved acute ischemic stroke care but also conceded a thorough analysis of patients' thrombi. Although early anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analyses have provided valuable insights into thrombus composition and its correlation with radiological features, response to reperfusion therapies, and stroke etiology, these results have been inconclusive so far. Recent studies applied single- or multi-omic approaches-such as proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, or a combination of these-to investigate clot composition and stroke mechanisms, showing high predictive power. Particularly, one pilot studies showed that combined deep phenotyping of stroke thrombi may be superior to classic clinical predictors in defining stroke mechanisms. Small sample sizes, varying methodologies, and lack of adjustments for potential confounders still represent roadblocks to generalizing these findings. However, these techniques hold the potential to better investigate stroke-related thrombogenesis and select secondary prevention strategies, and to prompt the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings, overview current strengths and limitations, and present future perspectives in the field.","['clots', 'ischemic stroke', 'large vessel occlusion', 'metabolomics', 'multiomic', 'proteomics', 'thrombectomy', 'thrombi', 'transcriptomics']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36834824,Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonism Attenuates Multiple Organ Failure after Renal Ischemia and Reperfusion in Mice.,"Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) that is often complicated by multiple organ failure of the liver and intestine. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is activated in patients with renal failure associated with glomerular and tubular damage. We thus investigated whether canrenoic acid (CA), a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, protects against AKI-induced hepatic and intestinal injury, suggesting the underlying mechanisms. Mice were divided into five groups: sham mice, mice subjected to renal IR, and mice pretreated with canrenoic acid (CA; 1 or 10 mg/kg) 30 min prior to renal IR. At 24 h after renal IR, the levels of plasma creatinine, alanine aminotransferase and aldosterone were measured, and structural changes and inflammatory responses of the kidney, liver, and intestine were analyzed. We found that CA treatment reduced plasma creatinine levels, tubular cell death and oxidative stress induced by renal IR. CA treatment also decreased renal neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibited the release of high-mobility group box 1 induced by renal IR. Consistently, CA treatment reduced renal IR-induced plasma alanine transaminase, hepatocellular injury and neutrophil infiltration, and inflammatory cytokine expression. CA treatment also decreased small intestinal cell death, neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine expression induced by renal IR. Taken together, we conclude that MR antagonism by CA treatment protects against multiple organ failure in the liver and intestine after renal IR.","['acute kidney injury', 'aldosterone', 'mineralocorticoid receptor', 'multiple organ failure', 'renal ischemia reperfusion injury']",2022-11-16,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36834481,The Role of the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death in Acute Liver Injury.,"Acute liver injury (ALI) is a globally important public health issue that, when severe, rapidly progresses to acute liver failure, seriously compromising the life safety of patients. The pathogenesis of ALI is defined by massive cell death in the liver, which triggers a cascade of immune responses. Studies have shown that the aberrant activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays an important role in various types of ALI and that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes various types of programmed cell death (PCD), and these cell death effectors can in turn regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is inextricably linked to PCD. In this review, we summarize the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and PCD in various types of ALI (APAP, liver ischemia reperfusion, CCl4, alcohol, Con A, and LPS/D-GalN induced ALI) and analyze the underlying mechanisms to provide references for future relevant studies.","['NLRP3 inflammasome', 'acute liver injury', 'programmed cell death']",2022-12-30,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36831722,Gastrodin Improves Cognitive Dysfunction in REM Sleep-Deprived Rats by Regulating TLR4/NF-κB and Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathways.,"Gastrodin is the active ingredient in Gastrodia elata. Our previous studies demonstrated that gastrodin ameliorated cerebral ischemia-reperfusion and hypoperfusion injury and improved cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to examine the effects of gastrodin on REM sleep deprivation in rats. Gastrodin (100 and 150 mg/kg) was orally administered for 7 consecutive days before REM sleep deprivation. Seventy-two hours later, pentobarbital-induced sleep tests and a Morris water maze were performed to measure REM sleep quality and learning and memory ability. Histopathology was observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining, and the expression of the NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways was examined using Western blot. After REM sleep deprivation, sleep latency increased and sleep duration decreased, and the ability of learning and memory was impaired. Neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region and the cortex were damaged. Gastrodin treatment significantly improved REM sleep-deprivation-induced sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits and neuron damage in the hippocampus CA1 region and cerebral cortex. A mechanism analysis revealed that the NF-κB pathway was activated and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was inhibited after REM sleep deprivation, and gastrodin ameliorated these aberrant changes. Gastrodin improves REM sleep-deprivation-induced sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction by regulating the TLR4/NF-κB and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and can be considered a potential candidate for the treatment of REM sleep deprivation.","['Gastrodin (GAS)', 'REM sleep-deprived rats', 'TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways', 'Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways', 'cognitive dysfunction']",2022-12-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36831272,Immune Cells Are Differentially Modulated in the Heart and the Kidney during the Development of Cardiorenal Syndrome 3.,"Cardiorenal syndrome type 3 (CRS 3) occurs when there is an acute kidney injury (AKI) leading to the development of an acute cardiac injury. The immune system is involved in modulating the severity of kidney injury, and the role of immune system cells in the development of CRS 3 is not well established. The present work aims to characterize the macrophage and T and B lymphocyte populations in kidney and heart tissue after AKI induced by renal I/R. Thus, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a renal I/R protocol by occlusion of the left renal pedicle (unilateral) for 60 min, followed by reperfusion for 3, 8 and 15 days. The immune cell populations of interest were identified using flow cytometry, and RT-qPCR was used to evaluate gene expression. As a result, a significant increase in TCD4+, TCD8+ lymphocytes and M1 macrophages to the renal tissue was observed, while B cells in the heart decreased. A renal tissue repair response characterized by Foxp3 activation predominated. However, a more inflammatory profile was shown in the heart tissue influenced by IL-17RA and IL-1β. In conclusion, the AKI generated by renal I/R was able to activate and recruit T and B lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as pro-inflammatory mediators to renal and cardiac tissue, showing the role of the immune system as a bridge between both organs in the context of CRS 3.","['acute kidney injury', 'cardiac alterations', 'immune system', 'ischemia/reperfusion']",2023-01-03,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36831271,Surgical Models of Liver Regeneration in Pigs: A Practical Review of the Literature for Researchers.,"The remarkable capacity of regeneration of the liver is well known, although the involved mechanisms are far from being understood. Furthermore, limits concerning the residual functional mass of the liver remain critical in both fields of hepatic resection and transplantation. The aim of the present study was to review the surgical experiments regarding liver regeneration in pigs to promote experimental methodological standardization. The Pubmed, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Studies evaluating liver regeneration through surgical experiments performed on pigs were included. A total of 139 titles were screened, and 41 articles were included in the study, with 689 pigs in total. A total of 29 studies (71% of all) had a survival design, with an average study duration of 13 days. Overall, 36 studies (88%) considered partial hepatectomy, of which four were an associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS). Remnant liver volume ranged from 10% to 60%. Only 2 studies considered a hepatotoxic pre-treatment, while 25 studies evaluated additional liver procedures, such as stem cell application, ischemia/reperfusion injury, portal vein modulation, liver scaffold application, bio-artificial, and pharmacological liver treatment. Only nine authors analysed how cytokines and growth factors changed in response to liver resection. The most used imaging system to evaluate liver volume was CT-scan volumetry, even if performed only by nine authors. The pig represents one of the best animal models for the study of liver regeneration. However, it remains a mostly unexplored field due to the lack of experiments reproducing the chronic pathological aspects of the liver and the heterogeneity of existing studies.","['hepatotoxicity', 'liver diseases', 'liver injury', 'liver regeneration', 'liver repair']",2022-12-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36831224,Lyophilized Extracellular Vesicles from Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Increase Muscle Reperfusion but Degrade Muscle Structural Proteins in a Mouse Model of Hindlimb Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a complication impacting multiple organs and tissues in clinical conditions ranging from peripheral arterial disease to musculoskeletal trauma and myocardial infarction. Stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may represent one therapeutic resource for preventing the tissue damage associated with I/R injury. Here we tested the hypothesis that lyophilized extracellular vesicles derived from adipose stem cells could serve as an ""off-the-shelf"" treatment modality for I/R injury in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model. Ischemia was induced for 90 min using a rubber band tourniquet and extracellular vesicles (0, 50, or 100 µg) administered via tail vein injection immediately prior to reperfusion. Perfusion was measured prior to, during, and after ischemia using laser Doppler imaging. Serum and tissue were collected 24 h after reperfusion. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics was used to characterize the EV cargo and proteins from the ischemic and non-ischemic hindlimb. Inflammatory cytokines were measured in muscle and serum using a multiplex array. Results indicate that EVs significantly increase reperfusion and significantly increase expression of the anti-inflammatory factor annexin a1 in skeletal muscle; however, the increased reperfusion was also associated with a marked decrease in muscle structural proteins such as dystrophin, plectin, and obscurin. Circulating inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 were increased with EV treatment, and serum TNF-alpha showed a significant, positive correlation with reperfusion level. These findings suggest that, while EVs may enhance reperfusion, the increased reperfusion can negatively impact muscle tissue and possibly remote organs. Alternative approaches, such as targeting mitochondrial permeability, may be more effective at mitigating I/R injury.","['Hsp90', 'annexin a1', 'dystrophin', 'exosomes', 'mitochondrial permeability']",2022-12-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36830644,Identification of the Subtypes of Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Based on Pyroptosis-Related Genes.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) often occurs in the process of kidney transplantation, which significantly impacts the subsequent treatment and prognosis of patients. The prognosis of patients with different subtypes of IRI is quite different. Therefore, in this paper, the gene expression data of multiple IRI samples were downloaded from the GEO database, and a double Laplacian orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (DL-ONMF) algorithm was proposed to classify them. In this algorithm, various regularization constraints are added based on the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm, and the prior information is fused into the algorithm from different perspectives. The connectivity information between different samples and features is added to the algorithm by Laplacian regularization constraints on samples and features. In addition, orthogonality constraints on the basis matrix and coefficient matrix obtained by the algorithm decomposition are added to reduce the influence of redundant samples and redundant features on the results. Based on the DL-ONMF algorithm for clustering, two PRGs-related IRI isoforms were obtained in this paper. The results of immunoassays showed that the immune microenvironment was different among PRGS-related IRI types. Based on the differentially expressed PRGs between subtypes, we used LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms to construct a diagnostic model related to renal transplantation. ROC analysis showed that the diagnostic model could predict the outcome of renal transplant patients with high accuracy. In conclusion, this paper presents an algorithm, DL-ONMF, which can identify subtypes with different disease characteristics. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis showed that pyroptosis might affect the outcome of kidney transplantation by participating in the immune response of IRI.","['diagnostic model', 'immune microenvironment', 'non-negative matrix factorization', 'pyroptosis', 'renal ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'renal transplant']",2022-10-23,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36830011,Hyperkalemic or Low Potassium Cardioplegia Protects against Reduction of Energy Metabolism by Oxidative Stress.,"Open-heart surgery is often an unavoidable option for the treatment of cardiovascular disease and prevention of cardiomyopathy. Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery requires manipulating cardiac contractile function via the perfusion of a cardioplegic solution. Procedure-associated ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury, a major source of oxidative stress, affects postoperative cardiac performance and long-term outcomes. Using large-scale liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics, we addressed whether cardioplegic solutions affect the baseline cellular metabolism and prevent metabolic reprogramming by oxidative stress. AC16 cardiomyocytes in culture were treated with commonly used cardioplegic solutions, High K+ (HK), Low K+ (LK), Del Nido (DN), histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK), or Celsior (CS). The overall metabolic profile shown by the principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmap revealed that HK or LK had a minimal impact on the baseline 78 metabolites, whereas HTK or CS significantly repressed the levels of multiple amino acids and sugars. H2O2-induced sublethal mild oxidative stress causes decreases in NAD, nicotinamide, or acetylcarnitine, but increases in glucose derivatives, including glucose 6-P, glucose 1-P, fructose, mannose, and mannose 6-P. Additional increases include metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway, D-ribose-5-P, L-arabitol, adonitol, and xylitol. Pretreatment with HK or LK cardioplegic solution prevented most metabolic changes and increases of reactive oxygen species (ROS) elicited by H2O2. Our data indicate that HK and LK cardioplegic solutions preserve baseline metabolism and protect against metabolic reprogramming by oxidative stress.","['cardioplegic solution', 'cardiopulmonary bypass', 'energy metabolism', 'potassium', 'reactive oxygen species']",2022-12-12,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36829829,Methane Admixture Protects Liver Mitochondria and Improves Graft Function after Static Cold Storage and Reperfusion.,"Mitochondria are targets of cold ischemia-reperfusion (IR), the major cause of cell damage during static cold preservation of liver allografts. The bioactivity of methane (CH4) has recently been recognized in various hypoxic and IR conditions as having influence on many aspects of mitochondrial biology. We therefore hypothesized that cold storage of liver grafts in CH4-enriched preservation solution can provide an increased defence against organ dysfunction in a preclinical rat model of liver transplantation. Livers were preserved for 24 h in cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) or CH4-enriched HTK solution (HTK-CH4) (n = 24 each); then, viability parameters were monitored for 60 min during normothermic isolated reperfusion and perfusate and liver tissue were collected. The oxidative phosphorylation capacity and extramitochondrial Ca2+ movement were measured by high resolution respirometry. Oxygen and glucose consumption increased significantly while hepatocellular damage was decreased in the HTK-CH4 grafts compared to the HTK group. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity was more preserved (128.8 ± 31.5 pmol/s/mL vs 201.3 ± 54.8 pmol/s/mL) and a significantly higher Ca2+ flux was detected in HTK-CH4 storage (2.9 ± 0.1 mV/s) compared to HTK (2.3 ± 0.09 mV/s). These results demonstrate the direct effect of CH4 on hepatic mitochondrial function and extramitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes, which may have contributed to improved graft functions and a preserved histomorphology after cold IR.","['liver transplantation', 'methane', 'mitochondria', 'reperfusion', 'static cold storage']",2022-12-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36829584,Pathways for Cardioprotection in Perspective: Focus on Remote Conditioning and Extracellular Vesicles.,"Despite the development of cutting-edge treatments, coronary artery disease (CAD) morbidity and mortality rates remain present at high levels. Therefore, new cardioprotective approaches are crucial to improve the health of patients. To date, experimental investigations of acute ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) have generally demonstrated the efficacy of local ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning cardioprotection techniques as well as of remote conditioning. However, application in clinical settings is still highly controversial and debated. Currently, remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) seems to be the most promising method for heart repair. Protective factors are released into the bloodstream, and protection can be transferred within and across species. For a long time, the cross-function and cross-transmission mechanisms of cardioprotection were largely unknown. Recently, it has been shown that small, anuclear, bilayered lipid membrane particles, known as extracellular vesicles (EVs), are the drivers of signal transduction in cardiac IRI and RIC. EVs are related to the pathophysiological processes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), according to compelling evidence. In this review, we will first review the current state of knowledge on myocardial IRI and cardioprotective strategies explored over the past 37 years. Second, we will briefly discuss the role of EVs in CVD and the most recent improvements on EVs as prognostic biomarkers, diagnostic, and therapeutic agents. We will discuss how EVs can be used as a new drug delivery mechanism and how they can be employed in cardiac treatment, also from a perspective of overcoming the impasse that results from neglecting confounding factors.","['cardioprotective strategies', 'ischemia/reperfusion injury', 'postconditioning', 'preconditioning', 'remote conditioning']",2022-12-28,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36829192,Plantamajoside alleviates hypoxia-reoxygenation injury through integrin-linked kinase/c-Src/Akt and the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathways in H9c2 myocardial cells.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury(MIRI) is one of the common complications after myocardial infarction surgery, Oxidative stress is among the main mechanisms of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Plantamajoside (PMS), the main effective ingredient in the genus Plantain, has been reported to possess an antioxidation, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis role. However, whether PMS can attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury is not yet known. Herein, we explored the effects of PMS on hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and the underling molecular mechanisms of the treatment. Network pharmacological analysis screened the top 31 key genes in the treatment of MIRI disease treated with PMS, and the result of molecular docking further illustrated the roles that the PMS play in the treatment of MIRI through its interference with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) target protein. PMS was not cytotoxic in the concentration range of 5-40 μM and increased cell survival after H/R injury in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting proliferation or growth. PMS significantly reduced the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, malonic dialdehyde, reactive oxygen species and cell apoptosis, and increased soperoxide dismutase activity compared with those of the H/R injury group. PMS promoted the protein and mRNA expression of ILK and Bcl-2, the protein expression of p-Akt, and reduced the protein and mRNA expression of Bax, Caspase-3, and Cytochrome c, the protein expression of p-c-Src. PMS has protective effects against H/R injury in H9c2 cells, and its protective mechanism may be related to reactive oxygen species clearance, activation of the ILK/c-Src/Akt pathway and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis.","['H9c2 myocardial cells', 'Hypoxia-reoxygenation injury', 'ILK', 'Network pharmacology', 'Plantamajoside']",2022-11-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36829177,Assessment of redundant randomized clinical trials among patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction.,"Redundant clinical trials waste resources and unnecessarily put patients at risk for harm. The objectives of the study were to assess redundant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in mainland China or the USA among patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and estimate the harm to patients enrolled in redundant RCTs.We searched bibliographic databases for eligible RCTs comparing a routine therapy with a placebo or no treatment among patients with STEMI in mainland China or the United States. The routine therapy for STEMI included reperfusion (percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolytic therapy), P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, statins, and anticoagulants. Redundant RCTs were defined as those initiated or continued recruiting new patients 1 year after the experimental intervention was established as routine therapy in clinical practice guidelines. Cumulative meta-analyses were conducted to confirm the efficacy of these routine therapies. The primary outcome was the number of extra major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) attributable to the deprivation of routine therapies among patients in the control groups of redundant RCTs-that is, the number of extra MACEs that could have been prevented had these patients received routine therapy.Nine hundred eighty-three eligible RCTs conducted in mainland China were identified, of which 775 (78.8%) were redundant. None of the five eligible RCTs conducted in the United States were redundant. All redundant RCTs have reiterated the benefits of routine therapies for patients with STEMI, while none were cited by the 2019 clinical practice guideline for the management of STEMI. The 18,819 patients in the control groups of redundant RCTs experienced 3305 (95% CI: 3169-3441) extra MACEs, including 1091 (1014-1165) deaths, 576 (519-633) recurrent myocardial infarctions, 31 (19-42) revascularizations, 39 (23-54) strokes, 744 (679-810) heart failures, and 823 (754-893) patients with recurrent or exacerbated angina pectoris. Cumulative meta-analyses confirmed the efficacy of the routine therapies among patients in mainland China and supported using practice guidelines to define redundant RCTs.Redundant RCTs conducted in mainland China have resulted in unnecessary MACEs among patients with STEMI. While the reasons behind redundant RCTs need to be further investigated, these results suggest potential research waste and violation of research ethics.","['China', 'Clinical practice guidelines', 'Redundant clinical trial', 'ST segment elevation myocardial infarction', 'United States']",2022-07-18,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36829080,Mitochondria-targeted combination treatment strategy counteracts myocardial reperfusion injury of aged rats by modulating autophagy and inflammatory response.,"Aging, as a recognized risk factor for ischemic heart disease, interferes with protective mechanisms and abolishes the optimal effectiveness of cardioprotective interventions, leading to the loss of cardioprotection following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. This study was designed to explore the possible interaction of aging with cardioprotection induced by combination therapy with coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and mitochondrial transplantation in myocardial I/R injury of aged rats.Male Wistar rats (n = 72, 400-450 g, 22-24 months old) were randomized into groups with/without I/R and/or CoQ10 and mitochondrial transplantation, alone or in a combinational mode. An in vivo model of myocardial I/R injury was established by left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and re-opening. Mitochondria were isolated from donor rats and injected intramyocardially (150 µl of the mitochondrial suspension containing 2 × 105±0.3 × 105 mitochondria) at the onset of reperfusion in recipient groups. CoQ10 (20 mg/kg/day) was injected intramuscularly for 7 days before I/R operation. Lastly, myocardial function, cTn-I level, expression of autophagy-associated proteins (Beclin1, p62, and LC3-II/LC3-I), and the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were assessed.Co-application of CoQ10 and mitotherapy concomitantly improved myocardial function and decreased cTn-I level in aged reperfused hearts (P < .001). This combination therapy also modulated autophagic activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (P < .01 to P < .001). This combinational approach induced noticeable cardioprotection in comparison with monotherapies-received groups.We found that combination of CoQ10 and mitochondrial transplantation attenuated myocardial I/R injury in aged rats, in part by modulating autophagy and inflammatory response, hence, appears to restore aging-related loss of cardioprotection in aged patients.","['Aging', 'Autophagy', 'Inflammation', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Reperfusion injury.']",2022-12-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36828372,Investigation of the Effects of Stress Hyperglycemia Ratio and Preoperative Computed Tomographic Angiography on the Occurrence of Acute Kidney Injury in Diabetic Patients following Surgical Thromboembolectomy.,"Acute lower extremity ischemia (ALI) is a cardiovascular emergency resulting from embolic and thrombotic causes. Although endovascular techniques have advanced, surgical thromboembolectomy is still the gold standard. Emergency thromboembolectomy surgery involves an ischemia-reperfusion injury, which also poses a risk for acute renal injury (AKI). The stress hyperglycemia rate (SHR) has recently emerged as an important prognostic value in emergency cardiovascular events. In the present study, we aimed to analyze the impact of preoperative contrast-enhanced tomographic angiography (CTA) and the SHR value on postoperative AKI in emergency thromboembolectomy procedures in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM). In this retrospective analysis, patients with DM who received emergency surgical thromboembolectomy after being hospitalized at our hospital with ALI between 20 October 2015, and 10 September 2022, were included. Patients were classified into two groups: Group 1 (N = 159), who did not develop AKI, and Group 2 (N = 45), who did. The 45 patients in Group 2 and the 159 patients in Group 1 had median ages of 59 (39-90) and 66 (37-93), respectively (p = 0.008). The percentage of patients in Group 2 with Rutherford class IIB and admission times longer than 6 h was higher (p = 0.003, p = 0.027, respectively). To determine the variables affecting AKI after surgical embolectomy procedures, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used. In multivariate analysis Model 1, age > 65 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.425, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.230-1.980, p < 0.001), preoperative high creatinine (OR: 4.194, 95% CI: 2.890-6.156, p = 0.003), and Rutherford class (OR: 0.874, 95% CI: 0.692-0.990, p = 0.036) were determined as independent predictors for AKI. In Model 2, age > 65 years (OR: 1.224 CI: 1.090-1.679, p = 0.014), preoperative high creatinine (OR: 3.975, 95% CI: 2.660-5.486, p = 0.007), and SHR (OR: 2.142, CI: 1.134-3.968, p = 0.003), were determined as independent predictors for amputation. In conclusion, when an emergency thromboembolectomy operation is planned in insulin-dependent DM patients, renal risky groups can be identified, and renal protective measures can be taken. In addition, to reduce the renal risk, according to the suitability of the clinical conditions of the patients, the decision to perform a CTA with contrast can be taken by looking at the SHR value.","['acute', 'computed tomography', 'contrast agent', 'glucose', 'thrombosis']",2022-12-29,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36827810,Impact of width of susceptibility vessel sign on recanalization following endovascular therapy.,"We aimed to investigate the relationship between arterial recanalization following endovascular therapy and the susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) length and width on susceptibility-weighted imaging.We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients with anterior circulation ischemic stroke who underwent magnetic resonance imaging preceded endovascular therapy, and measured the SVS length and width. Successful recanalization was defined as expanded thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade of 2b to 3. Logistic regression analysis was executed to determine the independent predictors of successful recanalization and first-pass reperfusion (FPR) after endovascular therapy.Among 100 patients, successful recanalization and FPR were observed in 77 and 34 patients, respectively. The median SVS length and width were 10.3 mm (interquartile range, 6.8-14.1 mm) and 4.2 mm (interquartile range, 3.1-5.2 mm), respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, SVS width was associated with successful recanalization (odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.07; p = 0.005) and FPR (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.89; p = 0.039). The optimal cutoff value for the SVS width to predict successful recanalization and FPR were 4.2 mm and 4.0 mm, respectively.Larger SVS width may predict successful recanalization and FPR following endovascular therapy.","['Endovascular therapy', 'Susceptibility vessel sign', 'Susceptibility-weighted imaging']",2022-09-19,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36827384,The Combination of Estradiol and N-Acetylcysteine Reduces Ischemia-Reperfusion Injuries of Mice Autografted Ovarian Tissue.,"Ischemia-reperfusion injuries are important issues after ovarian tissue transplantation (OTT). Our study examined the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and estradiol (E2) on mouse ovarian autografts. Mice (6-8 weeks) were divided into ovarian autograft as follows: Control: fresh OTT; Sham: cryopreserved/warmed OTT; NAC: cryopreserved/warmed OTT with NAC treatment; E2: cryopreserved/warmed OTT with E2 treatment; NAC+E2: cryopreserved/warmed OTT with the treatment of NAC and E2. In all groups, grafts were harvested on days 2, 7, and 28 after transplantation to evaluate histological parameters, inflammation relative to genes expression, and oxidative status. Histological analysis showed that NAC, E2, and a combination of NAC+E2 significantly increased the primordial, preantral, and antral follicular number. When NAC was used, it significantly reduced the expression of Tnf-α and Fgf-2, whereas it increased Il-1β, Il-6, and Vegf expression levels. The levels of Il-6, Fgf-2, and VEGF were dramatically increased in the E2-treated group. The combination of NAC and E2 significantly increased levels of Il-1β, Il-6, Fgf-2, and Vegf. NAC and E2 alone or in combination significantly increased total antioxidant capacity but did not affect the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. In conclusion, after transplantation, NAC and E2 alone or in combination, could improve follicular development and angiogenesis as well as decline inflammation and ovarian oxidative damage.","['N-acetylcysteine', 'estradiol', 'ovary', 'transplantation']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36827083,"Off-Hours Presentation, Door-to-Balloon Time, and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Referred for Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.","Presentation with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during off-hours may impact timely reperfusion and clinical outcomes. We investigated the association between off-hours presentation, door-to-balloon time, and in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).We included consecutive patients referred for primary PCI at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute between July 2004 and December 2017. The off-hours group included patients presenting on weekends, statutory holidays, or between 18:00 to 07:59 hours on weekdays. The on-hours group included patients presenting between 08:00 and 17:59 hours on weekdays. The primary clinical outcome was the adjusted in-hospital mortality. The primary quality-of-care indicator was door-to-balloon time.A total of 5132 patients were included, with 3152 (61.4%) in the off-hours group and 1980 (38.6%) in the on-hours group. The median door-to-balloon time was longer in the off-hours group compared with the on-hours group (102 minutes vs 77 minutes; P<.001), while the median onset-to-door time was similar (P=.40). There was no difference in the rates of in-hospital mortality (3.5% vs 3.0%; P=.32) or in the adjusted mortality (odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.8; P=.44) between off-hours and on-hours groups. However, door-to-balloon time was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (P<.01) and off-hours presentation was an independent predictor of longer door-to-balloon time (P<.001), with an excess of 22.1 minutes.Patients treated with primary PCI during off-hours had longer door-to-balloon times. Treatment during off-hours was an independent predictor of longer door-to-balloon time and longer door-to-balloon times were associated with higher mortality.","[' door-to-balloon time', ' myocardial infarction', ' off-hours', ' percutaneous coronary\nintervention', 'mortality']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36826575,Expression Pattern and Molecular Mechanism of Oxidative Stress-Related Genes in Myocardial Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,"(1) Background: The molecular mechanism of oxidative stress-related genes (OSRGs) in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) has not been fully elucidated. (2) Methods: Differential expression analysis, enrichment analysis, and PPI analysis were performed on the MIRI-related datasets GSE160516 and GSE61592 to find key pathways and hub genes. OSRGs were obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). The expression pattern and time changes of them were studied on the basis of their raw expression data. Corresponding online databases were used to predict miRNAs, transcription factors (TFs), and therapeutic drugs targeting common differentially expressed OSRGs. These identified OSRGs were further verified in the external dataset GSE4105 and H9C2 cell hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) model. (3) Results: A total of 134 DEGs of MIRI were identified which were enriched in the pathways of ""immune response"", ""inflammatory response"", ""neutrophil chemotaxis"", ""phagosome"", and ""platelet activation"". Six hub genes and 12 common differentially expressed OSRGs were identified. A total of 168 miRNAs, 41 TFs, and 21 therapeutic drugs were predicted targeting these OSRGs. Lastly, the expression trends of Aif1, Apoe, Arg1, Col1a1, Gpx7, and Hmox1 were confirmed in the external dataset and HR model. (4) Conclusions: Aif1, Apoe, Arg1, Col1a1, Gpx7, and Hmox1 may be involved in the oxidative stress mechanism of MIRI, and the intervention of these genes may be a potential therapeutic strategy.","['bioinformatics analysis', 'enrichment analysis', 'miRNA', 'myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury', 'oxidative stress', 'therapeutic drug', 'transcription factors']",2023-01-13,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36826023,Myrrh Essential Oil Mitigates Renal Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Injury.,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury is a common reason for kidney injury in clinical settings; therefore, continuous investigation of novel nephroprotective agents is crucial. Myrrh, the oleoresin exudates generated by the genus Commiphora, display numerous pharmacological actions. This study tried to assess the preventive effects of myrrh essential oil against I/R-induced renal damage.Rats were randomized into five groups. In the sham group, the animals were subjected to bilateral renal artery separation with no occlusion. In the sham + myrrh group; the rats were administered myrrh essential oil and then treated similarly to the sham group. Renal I/R group: the animals were challenged with renal I/R. In the myrrh + renal I/R groups, rats were administered 50 or 100 mg/kg of myrrh essential oil orally for three weeks before being confronted with I/R.Serum levels of renal function tests and renal injury biomarkers, including NGAL, KIM-1, and CysC, were amplified in the renal I/R group. Animals that experienced renal I/R exhibited elevated lipid peroxidation (MDA); declined SOD, CAT, and GPx activity; declined GSH content; augmented TLR4/NFκB gene expression; and subsequent enhancement of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and IL-6). Myrrh reduced renal function tests and injury biomarkers and amended renal histological alterations. Pretreatment with myrrh reduced MDA, elevated the antioxidant enzymes' activities and GSH content, and reduced the TLR4 and NFκB gene expression, leading to subsequent inflammation and apoptosis alleviation.The outcomes of the present investigation established the protective effect of myrrh essential oil against renal I/R via pointing out the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic effects of myrrh.","['anti-apoptotic', 'anti-inflammatory', 'antioxidant', 'essential oil', 'myrrh', 'renal ischemia/reperfusion']",2022-12-22,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36825607,Testicular torsion in vivo models: Mechanisms and treatments.,"Testicular torsion is a condition in which a testis rotates around its longitudinal axis and twists the spermatic cord. This in turn results in a significant decrease in blood flow and perfusion of testicular tissue. During Testicular torsion, the testicular tissue is affected by ischemia, heat stress, hypoxia, and oxidative and nitrosative stress. The testicular torsion should be considered an emergency condition and surgical intervention (testicular detorsion ) as the sole treatment option in viable cases involves counter-rotation on twisted testes associated, when possible, to orchipexy, in order to avoid recurrence. Possible testicular detorsion side-effects occur due to reperfusion and endothelial cells injury, microcirculation disturbances, and intense germ cells loss.To discuss testicular torsion surgery-based methods, different time frames for testicular torsion induction, and the associated pathophysiology by emphasizing cellular and molecular events as well as different therapeutic agent applications for testicular torsion.We reviewed all original research and epidemiological papers related to testicular torsion condition.Testicular torsion causes germ cell necrosis, arrested spermatogenesis, and diminished testosterone levels, with consequent infertility. Among different involved pathophysiological impacts, testicular torsion/detorsion-induced ischemia seems to play the key role by leading the tissue toward other series of events in testis. Numerous studies have used adjuvant antioxidants, calcium channel blockers, anti-inflammatory agents, or vasodilating agents in order to decrease these effects.To the best of our knowledge, no previously conducted study examined therapeutical agents' beneficial effects post clinical I/R condition in humans. Different agents targeting different pathophysiological conditions were used to ameliorate the ischemia/reperfusion-induced condition in animal models, however, none of the administrated agents were tested in human cases. Although considering testicular detorsion surgery is still the golden method to reverse the testicular torsion condition and the surgical approach is undeniable, the evaluated agents with beneficial effects, need to be investigated furthermore in clinical conditions. Thus, furthermore clinical studies and case reports are required to approve the animal models proposed agents' beneficial impacts.","['animal models', 'medical therapy', 'reperfusion', 'spermatogenesis', 'testicular torsion']",2022-07-25,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36825458,Safety and efficacy of intracoronary thrombolytic agents during primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI.,"Large thrombus burden in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with higher rates of distal embolization, no-reflow phenomenon, abrupt closure, stent thrombosis, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and mortality. Intracoronary (IC) thrombolytic agents are theoretically attractive as an adjunct to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) as they activate endogenous fibrinolysis which results in degradation of the cross-linked fibrin matrix in coronary thrombus.We reviewed published studies reporting on intraprocedural anti-thrombus strategies used during PPCI including randomized controlled trials and observational studies.Published studies are limited by small sample size and heterogeneity due to variation in indication, inclusion criteria, thrombolytic agent, dose, delivery mechanisms, antiplatelet and anticoagulant regimen, timing in regard to reperfusion, PCI techniques, and endpoints. Despite these limitations, data are consistent that IC administration of thrombolytic agents at low doses is associated with low rates of bleeding and vascular complications. While there is currently no compelling data demonstrating a benefit to the routine use of IC thrombolytic therapy in patients with STEMI, there is suggestive data that IC thrombolysis may have benefit in selected patients.","['STEMI', 'intracoronary', 'primary PCI', 'thrombolysis', 'thrombus']",,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36824459,The role of (pro)renin receptor and its soluble form in cardiovascular diseases.,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a major classic therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. In addition to the circulating RAS, local tissue RAS has been identified in various tissues and plays roles in tissue inflammation and tissue fibrosis. (Pro)renin receptor (PRR) was identified as a new member of RAS in 2002. Studies have demonstrated the effects of PRR and its soluble form in local tissue RAS. Moreover, as an important part of vacuolar H+-ATPase, it also contributes to normal lysosome function and cell survival. Evidently, PRR participates in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and may be a potential therapeutic target of cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on the effects of PRR and its soluble form on the physiological state, hypertension, myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, heart failure, metabolic cardiomyopathy, and atherosclerosis. We aimed to investigate the possibilities and challenges of PRR and its soluble form as a new therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases.","['(pro)renin receptor', 'cardiovascular disease', 'fibrosis', 'hypertension', 'renin-angiotensin system']",2022-11-01,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
36822483,Cyclosporine A-loaded apoferritin alleviates myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by simultaneously blocking ferroptosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.,"Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) seriously restricts the therapeutic effect of reperfusion. It is demonstrated that ferroptosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes are widely involved in MI/RI. Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes can be a promising strategy to treat MI/RI. Besides, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is highly expressed in ischemic myocardium, and apoferritin (ApoFn) is a ligand of the transferrin receptor. In this study, CsA@ApoFn was prepared by wrapping cyclosporin A (CsA) with ApoFn and actively accumulated in ischemic cardiomyocytes through TfR1 mediated endoctosis in MI/RI mice. After entering cardiomyocytes, ApoFn in CsA@ApoFn inhibited ferroptosis of ischemic cardiomyocytes by increasing the protein expression of GPX4 and reducing the content of labile iron pool and lipid peroxides. At the same time, CsA in CsA@ApoFn attenuated the apoptosis of ischemic cardiomyocytes through recovering mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing the level of reactive oxygen species, which played a synergistic role with ApoFn in the treatment of MI/RI. In conclusion, CsA@ApoFn restored cardiac function of MI/RI mice by simultaneously blocking ferroptosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. ApoFn itself not only served as a safe carrier to specifically deliver CsA to ischemic cardiomyocytes but also played a therapeutic role on MI/RI. CsA@ApoFn is proved as an effective drug delivery platform for the treatment of MI/RI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Recent studies have shown that ferroptosis is an important mechanism of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI). Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes can be a promising strategy to treat MI/RI. Apoferritin, as a delivery carrier, can actively target to ischemic myocardium through binding with highly expressed transferrin receptor on ischemic cardiomyocytes. At the same time, apoferritin plays a protective role on ischemic cardiomyocytes by inhibiting ferroptosis. This strategy of killing two birds with one stone significantly improves the therapeutic effect on MI/RI while does not need more pharmaceutical excipients, which has the prospect of clinical transformation.","['Apoferritin', 'Apoptosis', 'Cyclosporine A', 'Ferroptosis', 'Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury']",2022-09-20,"['ischemia', 'reperfusion']"
