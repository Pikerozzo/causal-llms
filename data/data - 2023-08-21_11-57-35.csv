37599188,"Prophylactic Platelet Transfusion: Is There Evidence of Benefit, Harm, or No Effect?","The optimal use of prophylactic platelet transfusion remains uncertain in a number of clinical scenarios. Platelet count thresholds have been established in patients with hematologic malignancies, yet thresholds backed by scientific data are limited or do not exist for many patient populations. Clinical scenarios involving transfusion thresholds for thrombocytopenic patients with critical illness, need for surgery or invasive procedures, or those involving specials populations like children and neonates, lack clear evidence for discerning favorable outcomes without undue risk related to platelet transfusion. In addition, while prophylactic platelet transfusions are administered with the goal of enhancing hemostasis, increasing evidence supports critical nonhemostatic roles for platelets related to innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation, and angiogenesis, which may impact patient responses and outcomes. Here we review several recent studies conducted in adult or pediatric patients that highlight the limitations in our current understanding of prophylactic platelet transfusion. Together, these studies underscore the need for additional research, especially in the form of robust randomized clinical trials and integrating additional parameters beyond the platelet count. Future research at the basic, translational, and clinical levels will best define the optimal role for prophylactic transfusion across the lifespan and its broader impact on health and disease.","['Bleeding', 'Platelets', 'Prophylaxis', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Transfusion']",2023-06-06,['lungs']
37599163,PET-CT SUVmax and Endobronchial Ultrasound Features for Prediction of Malignancy: A Prospective Study.,"Accurate and early staging of lung cancer has a critical impact on its prognosis. EBUS-TBNA is often the procedure of choice for mediastinal staging. Comprehension of the likelihood of malignancy of each lymph node (LN) can assist puncture decision-making during EBUS and offer insight of the procedure expected diagnostic yield.Prospective analysis of mediastinal LN of patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA from April 2021 to May 2022. The relationship between PET-CT SUVmax levels, EBUS features, and malignancy on LN was investigated. For statistical analysis, patients were assigned to 3 groups: suspected malignancy (diagnosis and/or staging), confirmed malignancy (staging) or suspected benign disease.A total of 363 LN from 132 patients (71% male, mean 62 years old) were analyzed. Among those with suspected benign disease, no LN puncture resulted in a diagnosis of malignancy. PET-CT SUVmax and short axis size were independent factors for malignancy in LN of patients who underwent EBUS for suspected (p < .001 and p = .047, respectively) or confirmed malignancy (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). All malignant LN presented SUVmax≥1.85 (≥2.85 for staging EBUS cases) and/or short axis size ≥4.28mm. Vascularized LN were more often malignant in either those with suspected (p = .087) or confirmed (p = .095) malignancy, although not statistically significant. LN that were simultaneously vascularized and lacked central hilar structure were also more commonly malignant (p = .013).LN that has higher SUVmax and are larger should be prioritized for puncture, followed by those vascularized and lacking central hilar structure. In staging EBUS cases, a systematic sampling (N3-N2-N1) is required and must precede any malignancy yield rationale.","['Bronchoscopy, EBUS-TBNA', 'Lung cancer, PET-CT', 'Lymph node', 'Mediastinal staging', 'SUV(max)']",2023-06-13,['lungs']
37599160,Dual-Centre Harmonised Multimodal Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Image Radiomic Features and Machine Learning Algorithms for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Histopathological Subtype Phenotype Decoding.,"We aimed to build radiomic models for classifying non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histopathological subtypes through a dual-centre dataset and comprehensively evaluate the effect of ComBat harmonisation on the performance of single- and multimodality radiomic models.A public dataset of NSCLC patients from two independent centres was used. Two image fusion methods, namely guided filtering-based fusion and image fusion based on visual saliency map and weighted least square optimisation, were used. Radiomic features were extracted from each scan, including first-order, texture and moment-invariant features. Subsequently, ComBat harmonisation was applied to the extracted features from computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and fused images to correct the centre effect. For feature selection, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were investigated. For machine learning, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost were evaluated for classifying NSCLC subtypes. Training and evaluation of the models were carried out in a robust framework to offset plausible errors and performance was reported using area under the curve, balanced accuracy, sensitivity and specificity before and after harmonisation. N-way ANOVA was used to assess the effect of different factors on the performance of the models.Support vector machine fed with selected features by recursive feature elimination from a harmonised PET feature set achieved the highest performance (area under the curve = 0.82) in classifying NSCLC histopathological subtypes. Although the performance of the models did not significantly improve for CT images after harmonisation, the performance of PET and guided filtering-based fusion feature signatures significantly improved for almost all models. Although the selection of the image modality and feature selection methods was effective on the performance of the model (ANOVA P-values <0.001), machine learning and harmonisation did not change the performance significantly (ANOVA P-values = 0.839 and 0.292, respectively).This study confirmed the potential of radiomic analysis on PET, CT and hybrid images for histopathological classification of NSCLC subtypes.","['Histopathology', 'NSCLC', 'PET/CT', 'machine learning', 'radiomics']",2022-09-27,['lungs']
37599145,Saliency maps provide insights into artificial intelligence-based electrocardiography models for detecting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"A 12‑lead electrocardiography (ECG)-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model can detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, since these models do not rely on discrete measurements as inputs, it is not apparent what drives their performance. We hypothesized that saliency maps could be used to visually identify ECG segments that contribute to a CNN's robust classification of HCM.We derived a new one‑lead (lead I) CNN model based on median beats using the same methodology and cohort used for the original 12‑lead CNN model (3047 patients with HCM, and 63,926 sex- and age-matched non-HCM controls). One‑lead, median-beat saliency maps were generated and visually evaluated in an independent cohort of 100 patients with a diagnosis of HCM and a high artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG-HCM probability score to determine which ECG segments contributed to the model's detection of HCM.The one‑lead, median-beat CNN had an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI 0.89-0.92) for HCM detection, similar to the original 12‑lead ECG model. In the independent HCM cohort (n = 100), saliency maps highlighted the ST-T segment in 92 ECGs, the atrial depolarization segment in 12 ECGs, and the QRS complex in 5 ECGs.Saliency maps of a one‑lead, median-beat-based CNN model identified perturbations in ventricular repolarization as the main region of interest in detecting HCM.",[],2022-11-22,['lungs']
