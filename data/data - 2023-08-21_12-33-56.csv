37599188,"Prophylactic Platelet Transfusion: Is There Evidence of Benefit, Harm, or No Effect?","The optimal use of prophylactic platelet transfusion remains uncertain in a number of clinical scenarios. Platelet count thresholds have been established in patients with hematologic malignancies, yet thresholds backed by scientific data are limited or do not exist for many patient populations. Clinical scenarios involving transfusion thresholds for thrombocytopenic patients with critical illness, need for surgery or invasive procedures, or those involving specials populations like children and neonates, lack clear evidence for discerning favorable outcomes without undue risk related to platelet transfusion. In addition, while prophylactic platelet transfusions are administered with the goal of enhancing hemostasis, increasing evidence supports critical nonhemostatic roles for platelets related to innate and adaptive immunity, inflammation, and angiogenesis, which may impact patient responses and outcomes. Here we review several recent studies conducted in adult or pediatric patients that highlight the limitations in our current understanding of prophylactic platelet transfusion. Together, these studies underscore the need for additional research, especially in the form of robust randomized clinical trials and integrating additional parameters beyond the platelet count. Future research at the basic, translational, and clinical levels will best define the optimal role for prophylactic transfusion across the lifespan and its broader impact on health and disease.","['Bleeding', 'Platelets', 'Prophylaxis', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Transfusion']",2023-06-06,['lung cancer']
37599163,PET-CT SUVmax and Endobronchial Ultrasound Features for Prediction of Malignancy: A Prospective Study.,"Accurate and early staging of lung cancer has a critical impact on its prognosis. EBUS-TBNA is often the procedure of choice for mediastinal staging. Comprehension of the likelihood of malignancy of each lymph node (LN) can assist puncture decision-making during EBUS and offer insight of the procedure expected diagnostic yield. Prospective analysis of mediastinal LN of patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA from April 2021 to May 2022. The relationship between PET-CT SUVmax levels, EBUS features, and malignancy on LN was investigated. For statistical analysis, patients were assigned to 3 groups: suspected malignancy (diagnosis and/or staging), confirmed malignancy (staging) or suspected benign disease. A total of 363 LN from 132 patients (71% male, mean 62 years old) were analyzed. Among those with suspected benign disease, no LN puncture resulted in a diagnosis of malignancy. PET-CT SUVmax and short axis size were independent factors for malignancy in LN of patients who underwent EBUS for suspected (p < .001 and p = .047, respectively) or confirmed malignancy (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). All malignant LN presented SUVmax≥1.85 (≥2.85 for staging EBUS cases) and/or short axis size ≥4.28mm. Vascularized LN were more often malignant in either those with suspected (p = .087) or confirmed (p = .095) malignancy, although not statistically significant. LN that were simultaneously vascularized and lacked central hilar structure were also more commonly malignant (p = .013). LN that has higher SUVmax and are larger should be prioritized for puncture, followed by those vascularized and lacking central hilar structure. In staging EBUS cases, a systematic sampling (N3-N2-N1) is required and must precede any malignancy yield rationale.","['Bronchoscopy, EBUS-TBNA', 'Lung cancer, PET-CT', 'Lymph node', 'Mediastinal staging', 'SUV(max)']",2023-06-13,['lung cancer']
37599160,Dual-Centre Harmonised Multimodal Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Image Radiomic Features and Machine Learning Algorithms for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Histopathological Subtype Phenotype Decoding.,"We aimed to build radiomic models for classifying non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histopathological subtypes through a dual-centre dataset and comprehensively evaluate the effect of ComBat harmonisation on the performance of single- and multimodality radiomic models. A public dataset of NSCLC patients from two independent centres was used. Two image fusion methods, namely guided filtering-based fusion and image fusion based on visual saliency map and weighted least square optimisation, were used. Radiomic features were extracted from each scan, including first-order, texture and moment-invariant features. Subsequently, ComBat harmonisation was applied to the extracted features from computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and fused images to correct the centre effect. For feature selection, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were investigated. For machine learning, logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost were evaluated for classifying NSCLC subtypes. Training and evaluation of the models were carried out in a robust framework to offset plausible errors and performance was reported using area under the curve, balanced accuracy, sensitivity and specificity before and after harmonisation. N-way ANOVA was used to assess the effect of different factors on the performance of the models. Support vector machine fed with selected features by recursive feature elimination from a harmonised PET feature set achieved the highest performance (area under the curve = 0.82) in classifying NSCLC histopathological subtypes. Although the performance of the models did not significantly improve for CT images after harmonisation, the performance of PET and guided filtering-based fusion feature signatures significantly improved for almost all models. Although the selection of the image modality and feature selection methods was effective on the performance of the model (ANOVA P-values <0.001), machine learning and harmonisation did not change the performance significantly (ANOVA P-values = 0.839 and 0.292, respectively). This study confirmed the potential of radiomic analysis on PET, CT and hybrid images for histopathological classification of NSCLC subtypes.","['Histopathology', 'NSCLC', 'PET/CT', 'machine learning', 'radiomics']",2022-09-27,['lung cancer']
37599084,Development of a simple high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method for sotorasib quantification in human plasma: Implications for therapeutic drug monitoring.,"Sotorasib, an oral small-molecule inhibitor, reportedly exerts promising activity against Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutant tumors. However, the currently administered dose may fail to represent the optimal dose based on the therapeutic efficacy. Herein, we developed a simple and sensitive method using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet (HPLC-UV) to measure the sotorasib concentration in human plasma. The sotorasib calibration curve exhibited linearity across the concentration range of 0.10-20.0 μg/mL (r2 = 0.9999). The coefficients of intra- and inter-day validation ranged between 0.79-9.75% and 3.01-6.13%, respectively. The assay accuracy ranged between -3.14 and 5.18%, with > 98.5% recovery. Subsequently, we applied the developed method to estimate sotorasib concentrations in a patient with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer. We anticipate that our HPLC-UV method will be valuable for assessing the safety and efficacy of sotorasib in larger patient cohorts.","['HPLC', 'KRASG12C mutation', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'sotorasib', 'therapeutic drug monitoring']",,['lung cancer']
37599064,Recent trends in radiotherapy use for major cancers in Korea.,"Although the trend in radiotherapy in all cancer patients has been studied, changes in radiotherapy modalities for specific cancer types have not been reported. This study aimed to analyze radiotherapy patterns for major cancers in Korea in recent years. We collected data from claims and reimbursement records of the Health and Insurance Review and Assessment Service from 2017 to 2020, according to initial diagnostic codes. The radiotherapy modalities for major cancers, such as lung, stomach, colorectal, breast and liver cancer, were analyzed. The radiotherapy modalities consisted of two-dimensional radiotherapy, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, proton radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy. Overall, from 2017 to 2020, the use of two-dimensional radiotherapy and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy decreased, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy increased. In 2017, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy accounted for approximately half of the radiotherapy in patients for lung and colorectal cancer, which was replaced by intensity-modulated radiotherapy in 2020. In 2020, stereotactic body radiotherapy also accounted for a large proportion of radiotherapy used in liver cancer cases. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was most used, followed by three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and two-dimensional radiotherapy for breast cancer in 2020. Among major cancers, radiotherapy utilization for breast cancer is the highest. Compared with other cancers, the number of patients receiving radiotherapy for stomach cancer was low. The number of patients receiving radiotherapy for major cancers has increased. The use of advanced forms of radiotherapy, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, is rapidly increasing for major cancers. The rate of radiotherapy utilization was higher in major cancer patients than in all cancer patients.","['Korea', 'breast cancer', 'liver cancer', 'lung cancer', 'radiotherapy']",2023-04-21,['lung cancer']
37598976,Regulation of cytokinesis and necroptosis pathways by diosgenin inhibits the proliferation of NCI-H460 lung cancer cells.,"Aim Overcoming resistance to apoptosis and antimitotic chemotherapy is crucial for effective treatment of lung cancer. Diosgenin (DG), a promising phytochemical, can regulate various molecular pathways implicated in tumor formation and progression. However, the precise biological activity of DG in lung cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the antiproliferative activity of DG in NCI-H460 lung carcinoma cells to explore the underlying antimitotic mechanisms and alternative cell death pathways. In a 2D culture system, we analyzed cell viability, multinucleated cell frequency, cell concentration, cell cycle changes, cell death induction, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and nuclear DNA damage, particularly in relation to target gene expression. We also evaluated the antiproliferative activity of DG in a 3D culture system of spheroids, assessing volume changes, cell death induction, and inhibition of proliferation recovery and clonogenic growth. DG reduced cell viability and concentration while increasing the frequency of cells with multiple nuclei, particularly binucleated cells resulting from daughter cell fusion. This effect was associated with genes involved in cytokinesis regulation (RAB35, OCRL, BIRC5, and AURKB). Additionally, DG-induced cell death was linked to necroptosis, as evidenced by increased intracellular ROS production and RIPK3, MLKL, TRAF2, and HSPA5 gene expression. In tumor spheroids, DG increased spheroid volume, induced cell death, and inhibited proliferation recovery and clonogenic growth. Our study provides new insights into the biological activities of DG in lung cancer cells, contributing to the development of novel oncological therapies.","['Cytokinesis', 'Necrosis', 'Phytochemical', 'Polyploid', 'Sapogenin']",2023-06-01,['lung cancer']
37598823,Cetuximab-based PROteolysis targeting chimera for effectual downregulation of NSCLC with varied EGFR mutations.,"PROteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) showed tremendous therapeutic potential in degrading several oncoproteins including undruggable proteins. PROTACs are bifunctional molecules where one-part binds to target protein while the other end recruits protein degradation machinery. With the unveiling advancements in the field of PROTACs, we explored a combinatorial approach by developing antibody-based PROTAC (ABTAC) which may effectively degrade one of the key oncoprotein driving proliferation and progression of cancer - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The objective of current research was to synthesize and characterize an EGFR degrading ABTAC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cetuximab and pomalidomide (E3 ligase recruiting ligand) were conjugated using lysine conjugation and copper free azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry. Analytical characterization using reverse-phase liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry suggested conjugation of five E3-ligase inhibitor molecules/antibody. Nearly 10-30 folds reduction in IC50 was observed with ABTAC in HCC827 (EGFR sensitive) and H1650 (EGFR resistant) cells compared to cetuximab. Multicellular 3D spheroid assay strongly suggested that ABTAC induced significant apoptosis and also inhibited cell proliferation compared to control and antibody alone. Circular dichroism and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) confirmed minor alterations in the structure and receptor binding efficacy of the antibody post-conjugation.","['ABTAC', 'Antibody-drug conjugate', 'Cetuximab', 'Click chemistry', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'PROTAC']",2023-05-16,['lung cancer']
37598676,Prognostic Potential of the Prognostic Nutritional Index in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Pembrolizumab Combination Therapy with Carboplatin and Paclitaxel/Nab-Paclitaxel.,"Pembrolizumab (Pemb) therapy in conjunction with carboplatin and paclitaxel (PTX)/nab-PTX has been efficacious in treating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the response predictors of this combination therapy (Pemb-combination) remain undetermined. We aimed to evaluate whether Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), body mass index (BMI), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) are potential factors in prognosticating the response to Pemb-combination therapy in advanced NSCLC patients. We retrospectively recruited 144 NSCLC patients receiving first-line treatment with Pemb-combination therapy from 13 institutions between December 1, 2018, and December 31, 2020. GPS, NLR, BMI, PLR, and PNI were assessed for their efficacy as prognostic indicators. Cox proportional hazard models and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients. The treatment exhibited a response rate of 63.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.0-70.6%). Following Pemb-combination administration, the median PFS and OS were 7.3 (95% CI: 5.3-9.4) and 16.5 (95% CI: 13.9-22.1) months, respectively. Contrary to PNI, NLR, GPS, BMI, and PLR did not display substantially different PFS in univariate analysis. However, multivariate analysis did not identify PNI as an independent prognostic factor for PFS. Furthermore, univariate analysis revealed that GPS, BMI, and PLR exhibited similar values for OS but not NLR and PNI. Patients with PNI ≥45 were predicted to have better OS than those with PNI <45 (OS: 23.4 and 13.9 months, respectively, p=0.0028). Multivariate analysis did not establish NLR as an independent prognostic factor for OS. The PNI evidently predicted OS in NSCLC patients treated with Pemb-combination as first-line therapy, thereby validating its efficiency as a prognostic indicator of NSCLC.",[],2023-05-24,['lung cancer']
37598649,Lung cancer in nonsmokers- A risk factor analysis.,"STONY BROOK MEDICAL CENTERRATIONALE: Lung Cancer screening for the high-risk smoking population has been proven to save lives. However, in 2022, 20% of newly diagnosed lung cancers (47,300) were in nonsmokers. These patients were found to be diagnosed at later stages. This may be at least partly due to not meeting criteria for and participating in current lung cancer screening. This study aims to describe characteristics of a never smoker patient population to help identify common risk factors which might merit inclusion in lung cancer screening and thus improve patient outcomes. This retrospective single center study included never-smoker patients diagnosed with lung nodules and never-smoker patients diagnosed with lung cancer from 2016 to 2022. Data was obtained from the Stony Brook Medical Center electronic medical record. 16,056 patients were identified as never-smokers who were asked by the medical assistant if they ever smoked in their lifetime. Patients were eliminated if they had any smoking history up to first diagnosis date. Demographics, radiology, histology, diagnosis dates, comorbidities, smoking status, and exposures collected through ICD10 codes and not self-reported, were investigated. Of 16,056 never-smoking patients, 9315 (58.02%) were females diagnosed with lung nodules and 6741 (41.98%) were males diagnosed with lung nodules. The univariate analysis showed significant differences between gender, age at nodule diagnosis, and patients with and without comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN), and family history (FHX) of lung cancer. The percentage of lung cancer patients among females was significantly higher than among males. Patients having lung cancer were older. The percentages of lung cancer patients with these comorbidities were significantly higher than those without. However, there was no significant difference found between patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The multivariable logistic regression suggested that age at nodule diagnosis and comorbidities including COPD (which included asthma, emphysema and chronic bronchitis) and family history of lung cancer were significantly associated with lung cancer. Older patients and patients with those comorbidities had a higher risk of developing cancer than those who were younger or without those comorbidities. The study excluded HTN and included age at nodule diagnosis in the logistic regression model as HTN was found to be protective against lung cancer due to age at lung nodule diagnosis. Please refer to the appendix for further details. Never-smoker patients who were older and with COPD and Family History of lung cancer had higher risk of developing lung cancer than younger patients without these comorbidities. In this study, gender had no impact on outcome.","['Lung neoplasm (D008175)', 'NLM class WF 658']",2023-05-19,['lung cancer']
37598630,Treatment-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with angiogenesis inhibitors in advanced lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with angiogenesis inhibitors have been used to treat advanced lung cancer. Their associated treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) are currently considered acceptable; however, no conclusion has been reached. We aimed to summarize the trAEs caused by ICIs combined with angiogenesis inhibitors in patients with advanced lung cancer. Pulled studies met the following criteria: patients with advanced lung cancer who received treatment involving ICIs combined with angiogenesis inhibitors (with or without chemotherapy) in interventional or observational studies. Results included the type and number of trAEs or immune-related adverse events (irAEs), treatment-associated discontinuation and mortality, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). CRD42022337656. The study enrolled 32 trials involving 2313 patients who had 7768 any-grade trAEs and 1078 grade ≥3 trAEs. The pooled incidences were 87.33% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79.49-93.65; I2 = 94.04%) for any-grade trAEs, and 38.63% (95% CI: 28.28-49.50; I2 = 95.61%) for grade ≥3 trAEs. There were 132 kinds of any-grade trAEs involving 18 systems, and 99 kinds of grade ≥3 trAEs involving 16 systems. For all trAEs, we observed significant differences in the line of therapy, trial design, therapy combination, and types of angiogenesis inhibitors (all P < 0.05). The rate of trAEs increased with dosage and frequency of medication. Pooled incidences of discontinuation and mortality were 10.64% and 0.81%, respectively. Nearly 647 patients experienced irAEs, including 636 any-grade irAEs and 154 grade ≥3 irAEs. Overall, the incidence of trAEs caused by ICIs combined with angiogenesis inhibitors is generally acceptable. These trAEs have a wide spectrum nearly covering the full range of adverse events. Grade ≥3 trAEs are more closely associated with angiogenesis inhibitors than any grade. However, treatment-associated mortality remains concerning.","['Adverse events', 'Angiogenesis inhibitors', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'Lung cancer', 'Meta-analysis']",2023-02-20,['lung cancer']
37598613,An assessment of the association between patient race and prior authorization program determinations in the context of radiation therapy.,"When a physician determines that a patient needs radiation therapy (RT), they submit an RT order to a prior authorization program which assesses guideline-concordance. A rule-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) evaluates whether the order is appropriate or potentially non-indicated. If potentially non-indicated, a board-certified oncologist discusses the order with the ordering physician. After discussion, the order is authorized, modified, withdrawn, or recommended for denial. Although patient race is not captured during ordering, bias prior to and during ordering, or during the discussion, may influence outcomes. This study evaluated if associations existed between race and order determinations by the CDSS and by the overall prior authorization program. RT orders placed in 2019, pertaining to patients with Medicare Advantage health plans from one national organization, were analyzed. The association between race and prior authorization outcomes was examined for RT orders for all cancers, and then separately for breast, lung, and prostate cancers. Analyses controlled for the patient's age, urbanicity, and the median income in the patient's ZIP code. Adjusted analyses were conducted on unmatched and racially-matched samples. Of the 10,145 patients included in the sample, 8,061 (79.5%) were White and 2,084 (20.5%) were Black. Race was not found to have a significant association with CDSS or prior authorization outcomes in any of the analyses. CDSS and prior authorization outcomes suggested similar rates of clinical appropriateness of orders for patients, regardless of race. Prior authorization utilizing rule-based CDSS was capable of enforcing guidelines without introducing racial bias.","['Cancer', 'Clinical decision support system', 'Equality', 'Race', 'Radiation therapy']",2021-11-12,['lung cancer']
37598474,MANet: Multi-branch attention auxiliary learning for lung nodule detection and segmentation.,"Pulmonary nodule detection and segmentation are currently two primary tasks in analyzing chest computed tomography (Chest CT) in order to detect signs of lung cancer, thereby providing early treatment measures to reduce mortality. Even though there are many proposed methods to reduce false positives for obtaining effective detection results, distinguishing between the pulmonary nodule and background region remains challenging because their biological characteristics are similar and varied in size. The purpose of our work is to propose a method for automatic nodule detection and segmentation in Chest CT by enhancing the feature information of pulmonary nodules. We propose a new UNet-based backbone with multi-branch attention auxiliary learning mechanism, which contains three novel modules, namely, Projection module, Fast Cascading Context module, and Boundary Enhancement module, to further enhance the nodule feature representation. Based on that, we build MANet, a lung nodule localization network that simultaneously detects and segments precise nodule positions. Furthermore, our MANet contains a Proposal Refinement step which refines initially generated proposals to effectively reduce false positives and thereby produce the segmentation quality. Comprehensive experiments on the combination of two benchmarks LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the tasks of nodule detection and segmentation tasks in terms of FROC, IoU, and DSC metrics. Our method reports an average FROC score of 88.11% in lung nodule detection. For the lung nodule segmentation, the results reach an average IoU score of 71.29% and a DSC score of 82.74%. The ablation study also shows the effectiveness of the new modules which can be integrated into other UNet-based models. The experiments demonstrated our method with multi-branch attention auxiliary learning ability are a promising approach for detecting and segmenting the pulmonary nodule instances compared to the original UNet design.","['Chest CT', 'Lung nodule detection', 'Lung nodule segmentation', 'Multi-branch attention']",2022-12-24,['lung cancer']
37598439,Focused acoustic vortex-mediated sonochemotherapy for the amplification of immunogenic cell death combined with checkpoint blockade to potentiate cancer immunotherapy.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) as an auxiliary modality of cancer immunotherapy enhances systemic anti-tumor immunity. However, the efficiency of SDT-mediated immunotherapy based on conventional focused ultrasound (FUS) is restricted by the tiny focal region of FUS. Focused acoustic vortex (FAV) possessing a larger focal region, can induce stronger cavitation and thermal effects than FUS with the same parameters, having the potential to overcome this issue. This research investigated the feasibility of FAV-mediated sonochemotherapy combined with the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to reshape immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), inhibit tumor growth and lung metastasis. Sonosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (Dox) were co-loaded into microbubble-liposome complex to compose Ce6/Dox@Lip@MBs (CDLM) for ""all-in-one"" synergistic sonochemotherapy, whose main components were clinical approved. FAV-activated CDLM significantly enriched immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers in tumors and amplified ICD of cancer cells compared with FUS-activated CDLM. Furthermore, the amplified-ICD combined with ICB increased the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, polarized M2 macrophages to M1 macrophages, and decreased regulatory T cells. This study provides a multifunctional strategy for enriching ICD inducers in tumors and amplifying ICD to ameliorate immunosuppressive TME and potentiate systemic anti-tumor immunity.","['Focused acoustic vortex', 'Immune checkpoint blockade', 'Immunogenic cell death', 'Sonochemotherapy', 'Systemic immunity']",2023-04-16,['lung cancer']
37598412,Development and validation of 18F-FDG PET/CT radiomics-based nomogram to predict visceral pleural invasion in solid lung adenocarcinoma.,"This study aimed to establish a radiomics model based on 18F-FDG PET/CT images to predict visceral pleural invasion (VPI) of solid lung adenocarcinoma preoperatively. We retrospectively enrolled 165 solid lung adenocarcinoma patients confirmed by histopathology with 18F-FDG PET/CT images. Patients were divided into training and validation at a ratio of 0.7. To find significant VPI predictors, we collected clinicopathological information and metabolic parameters measured from PET/CT images. Three-dimensional (3D) radiomics features were extracted from each PET and CT volume of interest (VOI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to determine the performance of the model. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) were calculated. Finally, their performance was evaluated by concordance index (C-index) and decision curve analysis (DCA) in training and validation cohorts. 165 patients were divided into training cohort (n = 116) and validation cohort (n = 49). Multivariate analysis showed that histology grade, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), distance from the lesion to the pleura (DLP) and the radiomics features had statistically significant differences between patients with and without VPI (P < 0.05). A nomogram was developed based on the logistic regression method. The accuracy of ROC curve analysis of this model was 75.86% in the training cohort (AUC: 0.867; C-index: 0.867; sensitivity: 0.694; specificity: 0.889) and the accuracy rate in validation cohort was 71.55% (AUC: 0.889; C-index: 0.819; sensitivity: 0.654; specificity: 0.739). A PET/CT-based radiomics model was developed with SUVmax, histology grade, DLP, and radiomics features. It can be easily used for individualized VPI prediction.","['18F-FDG', 'Lung adenocarcinoma', 'Positron Emission Tomography', 'Radiomics', 'Visceral pleural invasion']",2023-06-12,['lung cancer']
37598236,Advances in methylation analysis of liquid biopsy in early cancer detection of colorectal and lung cancer.,"Methylation patterns in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have emerged as a promising genomic feature for detecting the presence of cancer and determining its origin. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion followed by sequencing (MRE-Seq) using cfDNA, and to investigate the cancer signal origin (CSO) of the cancer using a deep neural network (DNN) analyses for liquid biopsy of colorectal and lung cancer. We developed a selective MRE-Seq method with DNN learning-based prediction model using demethylated-sequence-depth patterns from 63,266 CpG sites using SacII enzyme digestion. A total of 191 patients with stage I-IV cancers (95 lung cancers and 96 colorectal cancers) and 126 noncancer participants were enrolled in this study. Our study showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.978 with a sensitivity of 78.1% for colorectal cancer, and an AUC of 0.956 with a sensitivity of 66.3% for lung cancer, both at a specificity of 99.2%. For colorectal cancer, sensitivities for stages I-IV ranged from 76.2 to 83.3% while for lung cancer, sensitivities for stages I-IV ranged from 44.4 to 78.9%, both again at a specificity of 99.2%. The CSO model's true-positive rates were 94.4% and 89.9% for colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. The MRE-Seq was found to be a useful method for detecting global hypomethylation patterns in liquid biopsy samples and accurately diagnosing colorectal and lung cancers, as well as determining CSO of the cancer using DNN analysis.Trial registration: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT04253509) for lung cancer on 5 February 2020, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04253509 .

37598139,Skeletal muscle index is associated with long term outcomes after lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer.,"Skeletal muscle indices have been associated with improved peri-operative outcomes after surgical resection of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, it is unclear if these indices can predict long term cancer specific outcomes. NSCLC patients undergoing lobectomy at our institute between 2009-2015 were included in this analysis (N = 492). Preoperative CT scans were used to quantify skeletal muscle index (SMI) at L4 using sliceOmatic software. Cox proportional modelling was performed for overall (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS). For all patients, median SMI was 45.7 cm2/m2 (IQR, 40-53.8). SMI was negatively associated with age (R = -0.2; p < 0.05) and positively associated with BMI (R = 0.46; P < 0.05). No association with either OS or RFS was seen with univariate cox modelling. However, multivariable modelling for SMI with patient age, gender, race, smoking status, DLCO and FEV1 (% predicted), American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, tumor histology and stage, and postoperative neoadjuvant therapy showed improved OS (HR = 0.97; P = 0.0005) and RFS (HR = 0.97; P = 0.01) with SMI. Using sex specific median SMI as cutoff, a lower SMI was associated with poor OS (HR = 1.65, P = 0.001) and RFS (HR = 1.47, P = 0.03). SMI is associated with improved outcomes after resection of NSCLC. Further studies are needed to understand the biological basis of this observation. This study provides additional rationale for designing and implementation of rehabilitation trials after surgical resection, to gain durable oncologic benefit.","['Computer tomography', 'Lung cancer', 'Non-small cell', 'Sarcopenia', 'Skeletal muscle']",2022-11-22,['lung cancer']
37598005,Prevalence of cancer in patients with hypothyroidism: Analysis using big data tools.,"To evaluate the frequency of different types of cancer in patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism using big data methodology on the Savana Manager platform. An observational, retrospective study was carried out using electronic medical record (EMR) data from the Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda (Madrid). Information from the EMRs was extracted using artificial intelligence techniques and analysed using the Savana Manager v3.0 software. Searches were performed using the term ""hypothyroidism"" and the terms corresponding to the tumours analysed. Of a total population of 506,749 patients, 23,570 (4.7%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Patients with this diagnosis had a significantly higher frequency of cancer than that found in non-hypothyroid subjects (OR 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.17). This higher frequency was found both in women (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.90-2.08) and in men (OR 2.83, 95% CI 2.63-3.05). However, this higher frequency of cancer was not observed in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Although the frequency of most of the neoplasms studied individually was higher in the population with hypothyroidism, we observed that hypothyroid patients over 60 years of age had a significant decrease in the frequency of prostate, lung, colorectal, and liver cancer. Data from this hospital cohort suggest that there is a significant association between the diagnosis of hypothyroidism and cancer. However, this association is less evident in hypothyroid patients older than 60 years.","['Big data', 'Cancer', 'Cáncer', 'Hipotiroidismo', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalencia']",2022-04-12,['lung cancer']
37597859,Primary lung adenocarcinoma mimicking recurrent pneumonia in a young adult.,"A man in his 20s with a history of tobacco use presented with recurrent shortness of breath. He was hospitalised three times within the past 4 months for similar symptoms despite completing several courses of antibiotic therapy. In this presentation, he was afebrile with rhonchi and decreased breath sounds over the right lung. Chest CT demonstrated large consolidations in the right middle and lower lobes, worsened compared with 4 months prior. Infectious workup including bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage did not identify a causative organism. Testing for immune disease was negative. Transbronchial biopsy ultimately identified well-differentiated stage 3b lung adenocarcinoma with a KRAS G12C mutation. The patient was referred to oncology for outpatient follow-up and has since initiated chemotherapy. This case highlights diagnostic biases encountered in young patients and the utility of bronchoscopic biopsy for definitive diagnosis in presumed community-acquired pneumonia when the clinical outcome is not improving as expected.","['Lung cancer (oncology)', 'Pneumonia (respiratory medicine)']",,['lung cancer']
37597849,Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy for patients with EGFR-mutated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who progressed on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.,"Treatment options are limited for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment failure with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This multicenter open-label, phase II study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy (cohort 1, TIS+chemo) or tislelizumab plus chemotherapy and bevacizumab (cohort 2, TIS+chemo+ beva) in EGFR-mutated non-squamous NSCLC patients who progressed on EGFR TKI therapies. Here, the primary analysis of the TIS+chemo cohort is reported. In the TIS+chemo cohort, patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations with prior EGFR TKI failure received tislelizumab plus carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel as induction treatment, followed by maintenance with tislelizumab plus pemetrexed. The primary endpoint was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The planned sample size was 66 with a historical control of 7%, an expected value of 20%, a one-sided α of 0.05, and a power of 85%. Between July 11, 2020 and December 13, 2021, 69 patients were enrolled. As of June 30, 2022, the median follow-up was 8.2 months. Among the 62 patients in the efficacy analysis set, estimated 1-year PFS rate was 23.8% (90% CI 13.1% to 36.2%), and its lower bound of 90% CI was higher than the historical control of chemotherapy (7%), which met the primary endpoint. The median PFS was 7.6 (95% CI 6.4 to 9.8) months. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached (95% CI 14.0 to not estimable), with a 1-year OS rate of 74.5% (95% CI 56.5% to 86.0%). The objective response rate and disease control rate were 56.5% (95% CI 43.3% to 69.0%) and 87.1% (95% CI 76.1% to 94.3%), respectively. Patients who had progressed on first-generation/second-generation and third-generation EGFR-TKIs at baseline had shorter PFS than those who progressed on first-generation/second-generation EGFR-TKIs (median 7.5 vs 9.8 months, p=0.031). Patients with positive ctDNA had shorter PFS (median 7.4 vs 12.3 months, p=0.031) than those with negative ctDNA. No grade 5 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed. Grades 3-4 TEAEs occurred in 40.6% (28/69) of patients. Grades 3-4 immune-related AEs occurred in 5 (7.2%) patients. The study met the primary endpoint for the TIS+chemo cohort. Tislelizumab plus chemotherapy is effective with an acceptable safety profile for EGFR-mutated non-squamous NSCLC after EGFR TKI failure.","['Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors', 'Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer']",,['lung cancer']
37597812,FADS2 function at the major cancer hotspot 11q13 locus alters fatty acid metabolism in cancer.,"Dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism and de novo lipogenesis is a key driver of several cancer types through highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) signaling precursors such as arachidonic acid. The human chromosome 11q13 locus has long been established as the most frequently amplified in a variety of human cancers. The fatty acid desaturase genes (FADS1, FADS2 and FADS3) responsible for HUFA biosynthesis localize to the 11q12-13.1 region. FADS2 activity is promiscuous, catalyzing biosynthesis of several unsaturated fatty acids by Δ6, Δ8, and Δ4 desaturation. Our main aim here is to review known and putative consequences of FADS2 dysregulation due to effects on the 11q13 locus potentially driving various cancer types. FADS2 silencing causes synthesis of sciadonic acid (5Z,11Z,14Z-20:3) in MCF7 cells and breast cancer in vivo. 5Z,11Z,14Z-20:3 is structurally identical to arachidonic acid (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-20:4) except it lacks the internal Δ8 double bond required for prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, among other eicosanoids. Palmitic acid has substrate specificity for both SCD and FADS2. Melanoma, prostate, liver and lung cancer cells insensitive to SCD inhibition show increased FADS2 activity and sapienic acid biosynthesis. Elevated serum mead acid levels found in hepatocellular carcinoma patients suggest an unsatisfied demand for arachidonic acid. FADS2 circular RNAs are at high levels in colorectal and lung cancer tissues. FADS2 circular RNAs are associated with shorter overall survival in colorectal cancer patients. The evidence thusfar supports an effort for future research on the role of FADS2 as a tumor suppressor in a range of neoplastic disorders.","['Fatty acid desaturases', 'Highly unsaturated fatty acids', 'Mead acid', 'Sapienic acid', 'Sciadonic acid', 'Unusual unsaturated fatty acids']",2023-04-17,['lung cancer']
37597792,Long non-coding RNA and the tumor microenvironment：prospects for clinical applications in breast cancer.,"Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the number one cancer worldwide, and invasion and metastasis are still the main causes of death in breast cancer patients. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is an important site for the growth of tumor cells nourished by vascular networks, and various components of the TME interact strongly with cancer cells and are one of the important mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis. In recent years, many studies have reported that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are involved in the formation of TME and influence the process of tumorigenesis and metastasis. This paper reviews the basic characteristics and functional roles of LncRNA in breast cancer TME and introduces the various mechanisms of LncRNA in breast cancer microenvironment that induce breast cancer development and metastasis in three directions: immune cells, non-immune cells, and extracellular matrix in TME, providing potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for clinical practice.","['LncRNAs', 'breast cancer', 'immunocytes', 'non-immune cells', 'tumour microenvironment']",2022-11-26,['lung cancer']

This adaptive phase 3 trial (NCT03631706) compared the efficacy and safety of bintrafusp alfa versus pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in patients with PD-L1-high advanced NSCLC. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1 per independent review committee (IRC) and overall survival (OS). Patients (N=304) were randomized 1:1 to receive either bintrafusp alfa or pembrolizumab (n=152 each). The median follow-up was 14.3 months (95% CI 13.1-16.0 months) for bintrafusp alfa and 14.5 months (95% CI 13.1-15.9 months) for pembrolizumab. PFS by IRC was not significantly different between bintrafusp alfa and pembrolizumab arms (median 7.0 months [95% CI 4.2 months-not reached (NR)] versus 11.1 months [95% CI 8.1 months-NR]; HR=1.232 [95% CI, 0.885-1.714]). Median OS was 21.1 months (95% CI 21.1 months-NR) for bintrafusp alfa and 22.1 months (95% CI: 20.4 months-NR) for pembrolizumab (HR=1.201 [95% CI, 0.796-1.811]). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were higher with bintrafusp alfa versus pembrolizumab; grade 3/4 TRAEs occurred in 42.4% versus 13.2% of patients, respectively. The study was discontinued at an interim analysis as it was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint. First-line treatment with bintrafusp alfa did not demonstrate superior efficacy compared with pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1-high, advanced NSCLC.","['PD-L1', 'bintrafusp alfa', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'phase 3']",2023-06-01,['lung cancer']
37597736,Quantifying the potential effects of air pollution reduction on population health and health expenditure in Taiwan.,"Air pollution, particularly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution, poses a significant risk to public health, underscoring the importance of comprehending the long-term impact on health burden and expenditure at national and subnational levels. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the disease burden and healthcare expenditure associated with PM2.5 exposure in Taiwan and assess the potential benefits of reducing pollution levels. Using a comparative risk assessment framework that integrates an auto-aggressive integrated moving average model, we evaluated the avoidable burden of cardiopulmonary diseases (including ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and diabetes mellitus) and related healthcare expenditure under different air quality target scenarios, including status quo and target scenarios of 15, 10, and 5 μg/m3 reduction in PM2.5 concentration. Our findings indicate that reducing PM2.5 exposure has the potential to significantly alleviate the burden of multiple diseases. Comparing the estimated attributable disease burden and healthcare expenditure between reference and target scenarios from 2022 to 2050, the avoidable disability-adjusted life years were 0.61, 1.83, and 3.19 million for the 15, 10, and 5 μg/m3 target scenarios, respectively. Correspondingly, avoidable healthcare expenditure ranged from US$ 0.63 to 3.67 billion. We also highlighted the unequal allocation of resources and the need for policy interventions to address health disparities due to air pollution. Notably, in the 5 μg/m3 target scenario, Kaohsiung City stands to benefit the most, with 527,368 disability-adjusted life years avoided and US$ 0.53 billion saved from 2022 to 2050. Our findings suggest that adopting stricter emission targets can effectively reduce the health burden and associated healthcare expenditure in Taiwan. Overall, this study provides policymakers in Taiwan with valuable insights for mitigating the negative effects of air pollution by establishing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the co-benefits of air pollution reduction on healthcare expenditure and disease burden.","['ARIMA model', 'Comparative risk assessment', 'Disease burden', 'Emission target', 'Healthcare expenditure', 'PM(2.5)']",2023-05-29,['lung cancer']
37597673,Daqing formula ameliorated allergic asthma and airway dysbacteriosis in mice challenged with ovalbumin and ampicillin.,"Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease that can lead to several complications caused by bacterial infections. However, recurrent attacks of the disease require long-term use of antibiotics, resulting in lung dysbiosis and poor outcomes. Daqing Formula (DQF) is a well-known herbal medicine in Pharmacopoeia of China, which is widely used for various stimuli-induced lower respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Thus, it has been demonstrated to be a plant-derived broad-spectrum antibiotic for treating and preventing various acute and chronic respiratory diseases. This study evaluated the efficacy and possible mechanism of DQF on allergic asthma and airway dysbiosis. The mice were co-challenged with ovalbumin and ampicillin to induce allergic asthma combined with airway dysbacteriosis. The populations of lung microbiota were detected by using 16s DNA sequencing. The levels of asthmatic markers in BALF were detected by ELISA. The levels of Th1/Th2 cytokines in splenic CD4+ cells of mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expressions of the GSK-3β signaling pathway in the lung tissues of asthmatic mice and eosinophils were detected by western blotting assay. The inhibition of DQF on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in eosinophils of asthmatic mice. The results showed that treatment with DQF at 200-800 mg/kg doses significantly reduced the frequency of nasal rubbing and lung inflammation as well as the number of total cells, eosinophils, and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It decreased the relative abundances of Streptococcus, Cuoriavidus, and Moraxella, increased Akkermansia and Prevotella_6 in lung tissues of asthmatic mice, and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and their resistant strains in vitro. Furthermore, DQF reduced the levels of eotaxin, TSLP, IL-4, IL-5, IL-25, and IL-33, but enhanced IFN-γ and IL-12 in BALF. It elevated the population of Th1 cells, inhibited eosinophil activation, and downregulated the expressions of p-GSK-3β, p-p65, nuclear β-catenin, and p-STAT3 in the lung tissues of asthmatic mice. The results revealed that DQF reduced airway inflammation, ameliorated lung dysbiosis, shifted the Th1/Th2 balance, and inhibited eosinophil activation in asthmatic mice, indicating its potential for severe asthma treatment.","['2,4(1H, 3H)-Quinazolinedione (pubchem CID: 64048)', '2-Methyl-4(3H)-Quinazolinone (pubchem CID: 135400457)', '4(3H)-Quinazolinone (pubchem CID: 135408753)', 'Antibiotic', 'GSK-3β', 'Indigo (pubchem CID: 10215)', 'Indirubin (PubChem CID: 10177)', 'Lung dysbiosis', 'Th1/Th2 balance', 'Tryptanthrine (pubchem CID: 73549)']",2023-05-11,['lung cancer']
37597304,Effect of antibiotic treatment on immune checkpoint inhibitors efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Gut microbiotaplays a crucial role in immune response. Recent data have shown that antibiotic (ATB) usage influences efficacy of immune check point inhibitors (ICIs) via altering microbiota of the gut. We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICIs as monotherapy or combination with chemotherapy (ChT) at the one academic center. Those receiving ATB for the first 12 weeks of the initiation of ICIs were compared with those who did not. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of ATB use on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR) during ICIs therapy. 90 patients were included in our analysis. Of these 90 patients, 27 (30%) received ATB in the first 12 weeks of the treatment. In patients who received ATB in the first 12 weeks of ICIs administration, PFS was significantly shorter (4.9 vs. 24.8 months, HR 2.52, 95% CI (1.52-4.18), p < 0.001). OS was also significantly shorter (5.4 vs. 37.8 months, HR 2.55, 95% CI (1.48-4.40), p = 0.001). We also examined the impact of ATB on ORR. Exposure to ATB for the first weeks consistently worsened the response rate; the ORR was 25.9% in the ATB group and 55.6% in the no ATB group (p = 0.01). Our findings demonstrated that the use of antibiotics around ICIs initiation was associated with decreased OS, PFS, and ORR in patients with NSCLC. This suggests that microbiota diversity may be one of the factors predicting the efficacy of ICIs.","['Antibiotics', 'Immune check point inhibitors', 'Non small cell lung cancer']",2023-06-16,['lung cancer']
37597303,Comparative safety of anaplastic lymphoma kinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase-mutated non-small cell lung cancer: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK-TKIs) are new treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Here, we quantified the toxicity profiles of different ALK-TKIs to guide clinical decision making. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Data were analyzed using random effects and consistency models under the frequency framework. Of 865 relevant studies, 13 RCTs (encompassing 3,353 patients) were finally included. A network meta-analysis of all-grade AEs, fatal AEs, and treatment discontinuation due to AEs revealed no significant differences among the six ALK-TKIs. The rates of grade 3-4 AEs were: alectinib (16.2%), crizotinib (46.4%), brigatinib (63.7%), ensartinib (75.6%), ceritinib (78.3%), and lorlatinib (91.6%). The toxicity spectra of ALK-TKIs were different. The most frequent AEs associated with crizotinib were gastrointestinal reactions, visual disorders, neutropenia, edema, fatigue, and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, while those in the alectinib group were anemia and constipation. Diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and increased serum creatinine were most common with ceritinib. The most frequent AEs in the brigatinib group were gastrointestinal reactions, hypertension, cough, headache, and elevated ALT or AST levels. The most significant toxicities of ensartinib were skin disorders, including pruritus and rash. Changes in lipid levels were the most frequent AEs associated with lorlatinib; weight gain, cognitive effects, and mood effects were lorlatinib-specific AEs. The toxicity spectra of ALK-TKIs differed. Alectinib might be the safest ALK-TKI drug according to the combined evidence of grades 3-4 AEs and the combined incidence.","['ALK inhibitor', 'Meta-analysis', 'Non-small-cell lung cancer', 'Safety', 'Toxicity']",2023-02-14,['lung cancer']
37597295,Age-related differences in symptom distress among patients with cancer.,"Differences in symptom distress among older (age 65-74) and very old (age 75+) patients with cancer, compared to younger patients, remain to be well explored. These differences are important to understand given the heterogeneity of older populations and may have implications for age-appropriate symptom detection and management. We examined routinely collected Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised (ESAS-r) scores from 9,143 patients age 40+ initiating chemotherapy for solid malignancies at a single academic cancer centre, between September 2011 and May 2019. We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine associations between the most common symptoms and age group (ages 40-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85+), cancer site, clinical stage, sex, and income levels. We focused our findings on patients with the five most common cancers, breast (n = 1,532), prostate (n = 923), lung (n = 889), pancreatic (n = 429), and colorectal (n = 368), prior to receiving treatment. Within our sample, 58.0% were age 40-64, 27.3% age 65-74, 11.8% age 75-84, and 2.9% age 85+. Among the nine symptoms in the ESAS-r (anxiety, depression, tiredness, wellbeing, nausea, pain, drowsiness, appetite, and shortness of breath), the most common symptoms overall were anxiety (moderate-severe scores [ESAS-r 4 or higher] were reported by 33.8% of patients), lack of well-being (38.3%), and tiredness (38.3%). Older age was associated with lower odds of moderate/severe anxiety (odds ratio [OR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-0.90 for age 65-74; OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.70-0.93 for age 75-84; OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.47-0.82 for age 85+; referent is 40-64-year-olds for all analyses), and increased odds of tiredness (OR 1.00, 95%CI 0.90-1.11 for age 65-74; OR 1.19, 95%CI 1.04-1.37 for age 75-84; and OR 1.34, 95%CI 1.04-1.72 for age 85+). Advanced stage, female sex, and lower income levels were associated with higher odds of moderate/severe tiredness, anxiety, and lack of well-being in adjusted models. Patients with pancreatic and lung cancers reported worse scores for these three symptoms than patients with other cancers. Older age was associated with differences in symptom experiences such as increased tiredness and reduced anxiety. Supportive care interventions and future research should focus on addressing these symptoms to improve patient quality of life.","['Aging', 'Geriatric oncology', 'Symptom distress', 'cancer']",2022-11-27,['lung cancer']
37597186,Neuroendocrine lineage commitment of small cell lung cancers can be leveraged into p53-independent non-cytotoxic therapy.,"Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) rapidly resist cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments. New, non-cross-resistant therapies are thus needed. SCLC cells are committed into neuroendocrine lineage then maturation arrested. Implicating DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the maturation arrests, we find (1) the repression mark methylated CpG, written by DNMT1, is retained at suppressed neuroendocrine-lineage genes, even as other repression marks are erased; (2) DNMT1 is recurrently amplified, whereas Ten-Eleven-Translocation 2 (TET2), which functionally opposes DNMT1, is deleted; (3) DNMT1 is recruited into neuroendocrine-lineage master transcription factor (ASCL1, NEUROD1) hubs in SCLC cells; and (4) DNMT1 knockdown activated ASCL1-target genes and released SCLC cell-cycling exits by terminal lineage maturation, which are cycling exits that do not require the p53/apoptosis pathway used by cytotoxic chemotherapy. Inhibiting DNMT1/corepressors with clinical compounds accordingly extended survival of mice with chemorefractory and ICI-refractory, p53-null, disseminated SCLC. Lineage commitment of SCLC cells can hence be leveraged into non-cytotoxic therapy able to treat chemo/ICI-refractory SCLC.","['5-azacytidine', 'CP: Cancer', 'chemotherapy resistance', 'decitabine', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'pyrimidine metabolism', 'radiation resistance', 'small cell lung cancer', 'tetrahydrouridine']",2023-02-22,['lung cancer']

A radiomics signature was generated by using the Pearson correlation analysis, univariate Cox analysis, and multivariate Cox analysis. Association of the radiomics signature with PFS was evaluated. A radiomics nomogram was developed based on the radiomics signature, then its calibration, discrimination, reclassification, and clinical usefulness were evaluated. In total, 6 CT radiomics features were finally selected. The radiomics signature was significantly associated with PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 4.531, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.524-5.825, p < 0.001). Incorporating the radiomics signature into the radiomics nomogram resulted in better performance for the estimation of PFS (concordance index [C-index] 0.799) than with the clinical nomogram (C-index 0.629), as well as high 6 months and 12 months area under the curves of 0.885 and 0.846, respectively. Furthermore, the radiomics nomogram also significantly improved the classification accuracy for PFS outcomes, based on the net reclassification improvement (33.7%, 95% CI 0.216-0.609, p < 0.05) and integrated discrimination improvement (22.7%, 95% CI 0.168-0.278, p < 0.05). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that in terms of clinical usefulness, the radiomics nomogram outperformed the clinical nomogram. A CT-based radiomics nomogram exhibited a promising performance for predicting PFS in patients with SCLC, which could provide valuable information for individualized treatment.","['Computed tomography', 'Progression-free survival', 'Radiomics', 'Small cell lung cancer']",2023-05-31,['lung cancer']
37597090,"GALNT2, an O-glycosylating enzyme, is a critical regulator of radioresistance of non-small cell lung cancer: evidence from an integrated multi-omics analysis.","Radioresistance is the primary reason for radiotherapy failure in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Glycosylation-related alterations are critically involved in tumor radioresistance. However, the relationship between glycosylation and NSCLC radioresistance is unclear. Here, we generated radioresistant NSCLC cell models by using fractionated irradiation. The aberrant glycosylation involved in NSCLC-related radioresistance was elucidated by transcriptomic, proteomic, and glycomic analyses. We conducted in vitro and in vivo investigations for determining the biological functions of glycosylation. Additionally, its downstream pathways and upstream regulators were inferred and verified. We demonstrated that mucin-type O-glycosylation and the O-glycosylating enzyme GALNT2 were highly expressed in radioresistant NSCLC cells. GALNT2 was found to be elevated in NSCLC tissues; this elevated level showed a remarkable association with response to radiotherapy treatment as well as overall survival. Functional experiments showed that GALNT2 knockdown improved NSCLC radiosensitivity via inducing apoptosis. By using a lectin pull-down system, we revealed that mucin-type O-glycans on IGF1R were modified by GALNT2 and that IGF1R could affect the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Moreover, GALNT2 knockdown-mediated in vitro radiosensitization was enhanced by IGF1R inhibition. According to a miRNA array analysis and a luciferase reporter assay, miR-30a-5p negatively modulated GALNT2. In summary, our findings established GALNT2 as a key contributor to the radioresistance of NSCLC. Therefore, targeting GALNT2 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.","['GALNT2', 'Glycosylation', 'Multi-omics', 'NSCLC', 'Radioresistance']",2023-03-27,['lung cancer']
37597078,"Reactive oxygen species, toxicity, oxidative stress, and antioxidants: chronic diseases and aging.","A physiological level of oxygen/nitrogen free radicals and non-radical reactive species (collectively known as ROS/RNS) is termed oxidative eustress or ""good stress"" and is characterized by low to mild levels of oxidants involved in the regulation of various biochemical transformations such as carboxylation, hydroxylation, peroxidation, or modulation of signal transduction pathways such as Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and other processes. Increased levels of ROS/RNS, generated from both endogenous (mitochondria, NADPH oxidases) and/or exogenous sources (radiation, certain drugs, foods, cigarette smoking, pollution) result in a harmful condition termed oxidative stress (""bad stress""). Although it is widely accepted, that many chronic diseases are multifactorial in origin, they share oxidative stress as a common denominator. Here we review the importance of oxidative stress and the mechanisms through which oxidative stress contributes to the pathological states of an organism. Attention is focused on the chemistry of ROS and RNS (e.g. superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, peroxyl radicals, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite), and their role in oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, and membrane lipids. Quantitative and qualitative assessment of oxidative stress biomarkers is also discussed. Oxidative stress contributes to the pathology of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurological disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, Down syndrome), psychiatric diseases (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder), renal disease, lung disease (chronic pulmonary obstruction, lung cancer), and aging. The concerted action of antioxidants to ameliorate the harmful effect of oxidative stress is achieved by antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutases-SODs, catalase, glutathione peroxidase-GPx), and small molecular weight antioxidants (vitamins C and E, flavonoids, carotenoids, melatonin, ergothioneine, and others). Perhaps one of the most effective low molecular weight antioxidants is vitamin E, the first line of defense against the peroxidation of lipids. A promising approach appears to be the use of certain antioxidants (e.g. flavonoids), showing weak prooxidant properties that may boost cellular antioxidant systems and thus act as preventive anticancer agents. Redox metal-based enzyme mimetic compounds as potential pharmaceutical interventions and sirtuins as promising therapeutic targets for age-related diseases and anti-aging strategies are discussed.","['Aging', 'Antioxidants', 'Metals', 'Oxidative stress', 'ROS', 'Signaling pathways', 'Toxicity']",2023-06-18,['lung cancer']
37597014,Intravenous injection of tumor extracellular vesicles suppresses tumor growth by reducing the regulatory T cell phenotype.,"Colorectal cancer is a disease of unmet medical need. Although extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been implicated in anti-tumor responses, discrepancies were observed among studies. We analyzed the role of tumor-derived EVs (TEVs) in tumor progression in vivo by focusing on regulatory T (Treg) cells, which play essential roles in tumor development and progression. A mouse model of colorectal cancer lung metastasis was generated using BALB/c mice by tail vein injection of the BALB/c colon adenocarcinoma cell line Colon-26. TEVs derived from Colon-26 and BALB/c lung squamous cell carcinoma ASB-XIV were retrieved from the culture media supernatants. A TEV equivalent to 10 µg protein was injected every other day for 2 weeks. Histology and immunohistochemistry studies revealed that lung tumors reduced in the Colon-26-EV group when compared to the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group. The population of CD4 + FoxP3 + cells in the lung was upregulated in the PBS group mice when compared to the healthy mice (P < 0.001), but was significantly downregulated in the Colon-26-EV group mice when compared to the PBS group mice (P < 0.01). Programmed cell death protein 1, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein, and CD69 expression in lung Treg cells were markedly upregulated in the PBS group when compared to the healthy mice, but downregulated in the Colon-26-EV group when compared to the PBS group. The changes in expression were dose-dependent for Colon-26-EVs. ASB-EVs also led to significantly downregulated Treg cell expression, although non-cancer line 3T3-derived EVs did not. Our study suggests that TEVs possess components for tumor suppression.","['Colorectal cancer', 'Extracellular vesicle', 'Regulatory T cell', 'Tumor progression', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles']",2023-03-30,['lung cancer']
37596992,Comorbidity and mortality in systemic sclerosis and matched controls: Impact of interstitial lung disease. A population based cohort study based on health registry data.,"This population-based, matched cohort study evaluates the impact of comorbidities on mortality among systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients with and without interstitial lung disease (ILD). Patients with a first-time SSc diagnosis between 2002 and 2015 were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry, separated into two cohorts - with ILD (SSc-ILD) and without ILD (non-ILD SSc), and matched 1:4 with controls from the general population on age, sex, residency and marital status. Comorbidity and mortality data were obtained from national registries. The Deyo-Charlson comorbidity score (DCcs) was used for assessment of the burden of comorbidities. 1732 patients with SSc and 6919 controls were included; 258 (14.9%) patients had SSc-ILD. The hazard ratio (HR) for death was 2.8 (95% CI 2.4-3.3) in SSc, and especially increased in SSc-ILD (HR 4.2 (95% CI 3.2-5.4)), males (HR 3.1 95% CI 2.4-4.1) and younger adults (aged 18-40 (HR 6.9, 95% CI 3.4-14.2) and 41-50 (HR 7.7, 95% CI 3.8-15.6)). In non-ILD SSc, mortality increased with increasing DCcs. Cancer was the most frequent cause of death in SSc (24.9% of deaths) and in controls (33.5%), in SSc followed by musculoskeletal and connective tissue diseases (22.7%); the cause of only 0.8% of deaths among controls. The high prevalence of comorbidities in SSc had extensive impact on mortality. Mortality was increased in males, in young adults and in SSc-ILD, underlining the excess mortality associated with ILD. These findings emphasise the importance of timely diagnosis and optimal management of organ involvement and comorbidities in SSc.","['Comorbidity', 'epidemiology', 'interstitial lung diseases', 'mortality', 'systemic scleroderma']",,['lung cancer']
37596964,Prognostic significance of the Rho GTPase RHOV and its role in tumor immune cell infiltration: a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis.,"Ras homolog gene family member V (RHOV) is an atypical Rho GTPase that participates in various important cellular processes. Although RHOV has been identified to play an oncogenic role in lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, its role in other types of tumors remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of RHOV in pan-cancer analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene-Tissue Expression datasets. RHOV mRNA levels were dysregulated in several types of tumors. RHOV expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor in 7 of 33 types of tumors; however, the relationship varied according to tumor type. Higher RHOV expression was associated with a favorable prognosis in kidney renal cell carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma, for which RHOV expression was downregulated, whereas RHOV expression was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, and uveal melanoma with upregulated RHOV expression. Furthermore, RHOV expression was associated with various clinicopathological parameters in these tumors. RHOV expression showed varied associations with different types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and demonstrated a potential impact on the response to immunotherapy depending on the cancer type. Additionally, functional enrichment analysis of RHOV-related genes demonstrated a role in a wide range of developmental and immune-related processes. This study provides valuable insights into the role of RHOV in pan-cancer development, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor or oncogene according to the cancer type and tumor microenvironment.","['RHOV', 'TCGA', 'immune infiltration', 'pan-cancer', 'prognosis']",2023-06-21,['lung cancer']
37596898,Efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with or without PD-L1 selection: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are standard treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, evidence regarding their relative efficacy and safety is lacking. This study compared the efficacy and safety of all currently available ICI treatments in patients with advanced NSCLC to identify optimal treatment regimens. PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 8, 2022. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs). Forty RCTs involving 22,526 patients were selected, and a total of 26 treatment regimens were identified. Treatment with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD-1) provided superior OS compared with anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) treatment. ICIs plus platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) was superior to ICIs treatment alone, although the addition of PBC increased treatment toxicity. Cemiplimab ranked first for OS and lowest for any-grade AEs in advanced NSCLC patients without PD-L1 selection. Regarding grade ≥3 AEs, the toxicity of ICI monotherapy or ICI-ICI combination was consistently lower than that of the other treatments. For patients without PD-L1 selection, cemiplimab showed the best OS, pembrolizumab plus docetaxel (Pem-DXT) showed the best PFS, and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and PBC (Atezo-Beva-PBC) showed the best ORR. Pembrolizumab plus PBC and Atezo-Beva-PBC were the most likely optimal treatments for OS and PFS in patients with PD-L1 expression <1%, respectively. In patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, treatment regimens containing anti-PD-1 provided superior OS benefits compared with those of PD-L1 treatment, and sintilimab plus PBC (Sint-PBC) provided the best OS benefit; as for PFS, ICI plus PBC consistently showed greater PFS benefits than ICI or PBC alone. For patients with anti-PD-L1 expression of 1-49%, camrelizumab plus PBC provided the best benefit for OS and PFS among included treatment. Durvalumab-tremelimumab-PBC and Atezo-Beva-PBC respectively presented the highest OS and PFS for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50%. Moreover, cemiplimab and Atezo-Beva-PBC yielded the best OS and PFS benefits as first-line treatments for patients with advanced NSCLC, respectively. Although ICI plus PBC likely resulted in superior survival outcomes compared to ICI treatment alone, it did increase toxicity. Cemiplimab presented a well-balanced efficacy and safety profile in advanced NSCLC treatment. Our findings with the current ICIs comparisons will aid future trials for cancer immunotherapy.

37596865,"Clinicopathological features, treatment modalities, and prognosis of esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma: A single-center retrospective study.","Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the esophagus is recognized to have a rare incidence, high malignancy, and poor prognosis. This retrospective study was designed to review the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (ENEC), analyze prognostic factors and explore potential biomarkers and optimal treatment strategies. We conducted a retrospective review of 82 patients diagnosed with ENEC between January 2009 and December 2020 in a single institute. The survival analysis was calculated with Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. Univariate analysis and a Cox regression model were used to analyze prognostic factors. The median overall survival time (mOS) for all patients was 13 months. The results of the univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with liver or lung metastasis (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.20-3.81, p = 0.01 and HR 3.17, 95% CI 1.50-6.69, p = 0.003) had poorer prognoses. Patients who exhibited positive CgA expression experienced superior survival outcomes compared to those with negative expression. (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19-0.68, p = 0.002). Patients benefited more from chemotherapy without adjustment compared to those who had adjustment (dose reduction or cycles less than three, HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.44-3.84, p <0.001). In multivariate analysis, CgA expression, liver and lung metastasis, and chemotherapy adjustment were independent prognostic factors. For patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma, advanced stage, chemotherapy adjustment, liver metastasis, and lung metastasis were associated with poor survival, while CgA expression was good for prognosis.

37596831,Investigation of the efficacy and feasibility of combined therapy of PD-L1-enhanced exogenous peripatetic adoptive natural killer (NK) cells in combination with antiangiogenic targeted therapy in the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.,"A 67-year-old male patient presented with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer with the primary lesion located in the right upper lung, accompanied by multiple metastases to the pleura and abdominal cavity with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. A combination therapy approach was used to target the patient's multiple systemic metastases after localized radiotherapy. The approach involved adoptive transfer of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhanced exogenous natural killer (NK) cells, along with antiangiogenic treatment. Allogeneic cord blood NK cells were infused back into the patient over two consecutive days. On the first day, the treatment was followed by a dose of 1200 mg of atezolizumab. Subsequently, the patient received a daily dose of 10 mg of anlotinib administered orally for 14 days. This was followed by a 7-day break, and each cycle lasted 21 days. After delivering localized radiation to the primary lesion in the right lung and metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes, complete remission was achieved in the local lesion, effectively avoiding the risk of superior vena cava syndrome. Following six cycles of combined therapy, most of the metastatic lesions had disappeared, and the remaining metastatic lesions had significantly reduced in size. The recent therapeutic effect resulted in partial remission. The combination therapy of immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1-enhanced exogenous adoptive transfer NK cells, along with antiangiogenic targeted treatment, demonstrated a satisfactory short-term effect, with disappearance of most of the metastases and noticeable shrinkage in the remaining metastatic lesions.","['PD-1/PD-L1', 'antiangiogenesis', 'extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer', 'immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'radiotherapy']",2023-06-05,['lung cancer']
37596822,Predicting pathological response to neoadjuvant or conversion chemoimmunotherapy in stage IB-III non-small cell lung cancer patients using radiomic features.,"To develop a radiomics model based on chest computed tomography (CT) for the prediction of a pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant or conversion chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with stage IB-III NSCLC who received neoadjuvant or conversion CIT between September 2019 and July 2021 at Hunan Cancer Hospital, Xiangya Hospital, and Union Hospital were retrospectively collected. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were used to screen features. Then, model 1 (five radiomics features before CIT), model 2 (four radiomics features after CIT and before surgery) and model 3 were constructed for the prediction of pCR. Model 3 included all nine features of model 1 and 2 and was later named the neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy-related pathological response prediction model (NACIP). This study included 110 patients: 77 in the training set and 33 in the validation set. Thirty-nine (35.5%) patients achieved a pCR. Model 1 showed area under the curve (AUC) = 0.65, 64% accuracy, 71% specificity, and 50% sensitivity, while model 2 displayed AUC = 0.81, 73% accuracy, 62% specificity, and 92% sensitivity. In comparison, NACIP yielded a good predictive value, with an AUC of 0.85, 81% accuracy, 81% specificity, and 83% sensitivity in the validation set. NACIP may be a potential model for the early prediction of pCR in patients with NSCLC treated with neoadjuvant/conversion CIT.","['computed tomography', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'pathological response', 'predictive model', 'radiomics']",2023-05-19,['lung cancer']
37596821,Preliminary investigation of elevated collagen and blood-clotting markers as potential noninvasive biomarkers for small cell lung cancer.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is highly aggressive with limited therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. Moreover, noninvasive biomarker tools for detecting disease and monitoring treatment response are lacking. To address this, we evaluated serum biomarkers of extracellular matrix proteins not previously explored in SCLC. We measured biomarkers in the serum of 16 patients with SCLC before and after chemotherapy as well as in the serum of 11 healthy individuals. Our findings demonstrated that SCLC serum had higher levels of collagen type I degradation, collagen type III formation, and collagen type XI formation than healthy controls. In addition, we observed higher levels of type XIX and XXII collagens, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor A formation in SCLC serum. The formation of type I collagen did not exhibit any discernible variation. However, we observed a decrease in the degradation of type I collagen following chemotherapy. Overall, our findings revealed elevated levels of collagen and blood-clotting markers in the serum of SCLC patients, indicating the potential of ECM proteins as noninvasive biomarkers for SCLC.","['biomarkers', 'collagen', 'extracellular matrix', 'small cell lung cancer']",2023-06-30,['lung cancer']
37596813,Enhanced prediction of postoperative radiotherapy-induced esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer: Dosiomic model development in a real-world cohort and validation in the PORT-C randomized controlled trial.,"Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis (RE) diminishes the quality of life and interrupts treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing postoperative radiotherapy. Dosimetric models showed limited capability in predicting RE. We aimed to develop dosiomic models to predict RE. Models were trained with a real-world cohort and validated with PORT-C randomized controlled trial cohort. Patients with NSCLC undergoing resection followed by postoperative radiotherapy between 2004 and 2015 were enrolled. The endpoint was grade ≥2 RE. Esophageal three-dimensional dose distribution features were extracted using handcrafted and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods, screened using an entropy-based method, and selected using minimum redundancy and maximum relevance. Prediction models were built using logistic regression. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and precision-recall curve were used to evaluate prediction model performance. A dosimetric model was built for comparison. A total of 190 and 103 patients were enrolled in the training and validation sets, respectively. Using handcrafted and CNN methods, 107 and 4096 features were derived, respectively. Three handcrafted, four CNN-extracted and three dosimetric features were selected. AUCs of training and validation sets were 0.737 and 0.655 for the dosimetric features, 0.730 and 0.724 for handcrafted features, and 0.812 and 0.785 for CNN-extracted features, respectively. Precision-recall curves revealed that CNN-extracted features outperformed dosimetric and handcrafted features. Prediction models may identify patients at high risk of developing RE. Dosiomic models outperformed the dosimetric-feature model in predicting RE. CNN-extracted features were more predictive but less interpretable than handcrafted features.","['convolution neural network', 'dosiomics', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'prediction model', 'radiation esophagitis']",2023-06-28,['lung cancer']
37596788,Effect of thoracoscopic and thoracotomy on postoperative wound complications in patients with lung cancer: A meta-analysis.,"Because of the difficult surgical procedures, patients with lung cancer who have received thoracic surgery tend to have postoperative complications. It may lead to postoperative complications like wound infection, wound haematoma and pneumothorax. A lot of research has assessed the effect of various surgery methods on postoperative complications in pulmonary cancer. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to establish if thoracoscopic is superior to that of thoracotomy in the rate of post-operative complications. From the beginning to the end of June 2023, we performed an exhaustive search on four main databases for key words. The Hazard of Bias in Non-Randomized Interventional Studies (ROBINS-I) was evaluated in the literature. In the end, 13 trials that fulfilled the eligibility criteria underwent further statistical analyses. The results showed that thoracoscopic intervention decreased the risk of post operative wound infection (dominant ratio [OR], 3.00; 95% confidence margin [CI], 1.98, 4.55; p < 0.00001) and air-leakage after operation (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04, 1.63; p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the rate of haemorrhage after operation (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.73, 1.66; p = 0.63). Our findings indicate that thoracoscopic is less likely to cause post operative infection and gas leakage than thoracotomy, and it does not decrease the risk of postoperative haemorrhage. As some of the chosen trials are too small to conduct meta-analyses, care must be taken when handling the data. In the future, a large number of randomized, controlled trials will be required to provide additional evidence for this research.","['air leak', 'thoracoscopy', 'wound infection']",2023-06-28,['lung cancer']
37596747,Risk Factors of Demoralization Among Lung Cancer Patients in Mainland China.,"Objectives: Due to the severity of cancer, patients may experience feelings of helplessness and despair, resulting in demoralization among lung cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the risk factors of demoralization in middle-aged and older Chinese lung cancer patients via their relationship with patients' demographic data and disease characteristics. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional descriptive study using a structured questionnaire including assessments of demographic data and disease, the Demoralization Scale Mandarin Version (DS-MV), the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire (MCMQ), as well as The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30). Results: Overall, 289/300 (96.3%) patients with lung cancer completed questionnaires. The mean score of DS-MV was 49.27 (SD=15.19) (range, 21-81) and the mean score of SSRS was 33.37 (SD=5.43) (range,17-48). Multiple linear regression analysis identified high demoralization was significantly related to age (p<.001), medical payment (p=.003), times of chemotherapy (p=.026), family monthly income (p=.025), avoidance dimension (p<.001), surrender dimension (p<.001), social support (p=.001), symptom score (p<.001), overall health score (p=.009) and function score (p<.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the factors influencing demoralization among middle-aged and older lung cancer patients. Demoralization is a prevalent psychiatric problem in Chinese lung cancer patients. Therefore, we recommend strong social support to be protective against demoralization. We suggest that medical staff establish the concept of social support for patients with lung cancer, actively seek effective resources from family, friends, and other social support organizations to help patients establish a social support system that improves patient courage and confidence in their post-cancer life.",[],,['lung cancer']
