37530300,Peering into the eye: A comprehensive look at ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and its diagnostic value in anterior segment disorders.,"Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a noninvasive imaging modality that enables in-vivo visualization of the structures of the anterior segment of the eye. Unlike routine ophthalmic diagnostic ultrasound which uses frequencies of 5-10 MHz, UBM utilizes ultrasound frequencies in the range of 50-100 MHz. The high-frequency probes in UBM allows for higher resolution and better visualization of subsurface ocular structures, even in the presence of anatomic or pathological obscuration. UBM has qualitative as well as quantitative applications in various disorders affecting the anterior segment of the eye. Despite its huge importance, many clinicians lack in knowledge about the technique and its clinical usefulness. The current educational video aims to address this gap in knowledge by highlighting the technique and various clinical indications of UBM.The purpose of this video is to demonstrate the technique of UBM and showcase its quantitative and qualitative implications and importance through various clinical cases.UBM is an imaging technique that assesses the depth of tissue structures by measuring the time delay of the returning ultrasound signal. This modality is capable of measuring the size of various structures within the eye, such as the cornea, iris, ciliary body, sclera, and the depth of the anterior and posterior chamber. To perform a UBM, a transducer is inserted into a specially designed eye cup filled with distilled water, creating a water bath environment. Axial and longitudinal scans can be performed in a similar fashion as in routine diagnostic B-scan ultrasound. Quantitative indications for UBM depicted in this video include measurements of corneal thickness, depth of the anterior chamber, and the width of the angle. The video also showcases how UBM can aid in the diagnosis and management of various anterior segment disorders like angle-closure glaucoma, plateau iris configuration, secondary glaucoma, and anterior uveitis with complicated cataract. Qualitative indications for UBM highlighted in this video include its role in intermediate uveitis, ocular hypotony, ocular surface tumors, cystic lesions of iris, and identifying the location and type of intraocular foreign bodies in the anterior segment based on the type of artifact seen. Additionally, the video shows the applications of UBM in scleral and episcleral pathologies.This video will educate clinicians about the technique of UBM and showcase a bouquet of UBM findings in various case scenarios, helping one to better understand the potential of this modality in clinical practice.https://youtu.be/F626TMbJXoU.","['Anterior segment and glaucoma', 'diagnostic modality', 'indications', 'ultrasound biomicroscopy']",,"['cornea', 'iris']"
37506357,Modified Basket Suture of a Floppy or Irregular Iris in Endothelial Keratoplasty.,"Performing endothelial keratoplasty in an eye with a damaged or irregular iris can result in uneven air filling, air escape behind the pupil, anterior iris curvature, a shallow anterior chamber, an uneven anterior chamber depth, difficulty inserting and opening the graft, and iris trauma. We herein present a modified basket suture technique to prevent these iris complications. Before insertion of the corneal donor graft, a double-armed 9-0 polypropylene suture on a curved needle is inserted from 4 equidistant points at the corneal limbus to create a box configuration directly anterior to the iris. These sutures prevent the iris from moving toward the cornea and the anterior chamber from becoming shallow when air replacement is performed. The suture also reduces intraoperative or postoperative iris-related problems because the air filling is more uniform and less prone to migration.",[],2023-04-03,"['cornea', 'iris']"
37474016,Untargeted metabolomics in the aqueous humor reveals the involvement of TAAR pathway in glaucoma.,"Understanding the metabolic dysfunctions and underlying complex pathological mechanisms of neurodegeneration in glaucoma could help discover disease pathways, identify novel biomarkers, and rationalize newer therapeutics. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the local metabolomic alterations in the aqueous humor and plasma of primary glaucomatous patients. This study cohort comprised primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), and cataract control groups. Aqueous humor and plasma samples were collected from patients undergoing trabeculectomy or cataract surgery and subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis. Spectral information was processed, and the acquired data were subjected to uni-variate as well as multi-variate statistical analyses using MetaboAnalyst ver5.0. To further understand the localized metabolic abnormalities in glaucoma, metabolites affected in aqueous humor were distinguished from metabolites altered in plasma in this study. Nine and twelve metabolites were found to be significantly altered (p < 0.05, variable importance of projection >1 and log2 fold change ≥0.58/≤ -0.58) in the aqueous humor of PACG and POAG patients, respectively. The galactose and amino acid metabolic pathways were locally affected in the PACG and POAG groups, respectively. Based on the observation of the previous findings, gene expression profiles of trace amine-associated receptor-1 (TAAR-1) were studied in rat ocular tissues. The pharmacodynamics of TAAR-1 were explored in rabbits using topical administration of its agonist, β-phenyl-ethylamine (β-PEA). TAAR-1 was expressed in the rat's iris-ciliary body, optic nerve, lens, and cornea. β-PEA elicited a mydriatic response in rabbit eyes without altering intraocular pressure. Targeted analysis of β-PEA levels in the aqueous humor of POAG patients showed an insignificant elevation. This study provides new insights regarding alterations in both localized and systemic metabolites in primary glaucomatous patients. This study also demonstrated the propensity of β-PEA to cause an adrenergic response through the TAAR-1 pathway.","['Angle-closure glaucoma', 'Aqueous humor', 'Metabolomics', 'Trace amine associated receptor-1', 'β-Phenyl ethylamine']",2022-10-27,"['cornea', 'iris']"
37460970,A novel technique of penetrating keratoplasty to prevent intraocular contents extrusion for infectious keratitis.,"To evaluate the safety and the effectiveness of our novel penetrating keratoplasty for infectious keratitis.Retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series of patients with infectious keratitis who received the novel penetrating keratoplasty technique were analyzed. A prepared plastic sheet was located between the diseased cornea and iris-lens diaphragm. After the diseased lesions were removed, the graft was positioned on the plastic sheet and sutured to the recipient bed. The plastic sheet was pulled out from the anterior chamber before the all interrupted sutures were placed. The intra- and post-operative complications, the outcome of the graft and the number of corneal endothelial cells were analyzed.A total of 82 eyes of 82 patients was included. The mean follow-up period was 29 ± 16 months (range from 13 to 45 months). No intraocular content extrusion, simultaneous cataract extraction and suprachoroidal hemorrhage occurred. Direct contact between the infectious cornea and the graft was successfully avoided. Greater than expected endothelial cell reduction or complications were not found.This modified technique effectively prevents the extrusion of intraocular contents while avoiding the direct contact with donor endothelium during the procedure. The occurrence rate of complications such as endothelial cell loss is not higher than the conventional methods.","['Extrusion', 'Infectious keratitis', 'Intraocular contents', 'Lens-iris diaphragm', 'Penetrating keratoplasty', 'Plastic sheet']",2022-04-14,"['cornea', 'iris']"
37448773,Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty with cornea press technique and implantation of a Carlevale scleral-fixated intraocular lens.,"We describe a combined Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK) using the Cornea-press (C-Press) technique, with implantation of a new sutureless, scleral fixated intraocular lens (IOL) (Carlevale, Soleko), in a case of bullous keratopathy and IOL mispositioning.Two scleral pockets were created along two scleral radial incisions, 180° apart, followed by two 23 G sclerotomies at the pockets' sites. After removal of the dislocated IOL through a corneoscleral incision, posterior vitrectomy was completed. The Carlevale IOL was injected into the anterior chamber (AC) and placed above the iris. The haptics were then externalized using opening distal forceps through the sclerotomies, and the plugs were secured in the scleral pockets. DMEK was then performed using the ""C-press"" technique, where corneal indentation allowed to artificially shallow the AC to ensure successful graft unrolling. Fifteen months postoperatively, the cornea was clear, the Carlevale IOL well positioned, and the patient's vision improved.DMEK using the C-Press technique, combined with a sutureless, scleral-fixated IOL such as the Carlevale in a single procedure, may be a safe and effective option to restore vision in case of bullous keratopathy and dislocated IOL.","['Bullous keratopathy', 'Carlevale IOL', 'Descemet membrane endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK)', 'Scleral fixated-IOL', 'Sutureless']",2023-01-19,"['cornea', 'iris']"
