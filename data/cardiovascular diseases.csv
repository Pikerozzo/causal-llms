37814928,"Efficacy of finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and altered markers of liver steatosis and fibrosis: A FIDELITY subgroup analysis.","Investigating the effect of finerenone on liver function, cardiovascular and kidney composite outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, stratified by their risk of liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Post hoc analysis stratified patients (N = 13 026) by liver fibrosis and enzymes: high risk of steatosis (hepatic steatosis index >36); elevated transaminases [alanine transaminase (ALT) >33 (males) and >25 IU/L (females)]; and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index scores >3.25, >2.67 and >1.30. Liver enzymes were assessed by changes in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Composite kidney outcome was defined as onset of kidney failure, sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥57% from baseline over ≥4 weeks or kidney death. Composite cardiovascular outcome was defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure. ALT, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were consistent between treatment groups and remained stable throughout. Finerenone consistently reduced the risk of composite kidney outcome, irrespective of altered liver tests. Higher FIB-4 score was associated with higher incidence rates of composite cardiovascular outcome. Finerenone reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular outcome versus placebo in FIB-4 subgroups by 52% (>3.25), 39% (>2.67) and 24% (>1.30) (p values for interaction = .01, .13 and .03, respectively). Finerenone has neutral effects on liver parameters in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Finerenone showed robust and consistent kidney benefits in patients with altered liver tests, and profound cardiovascular benefits even in patients with higher FIB-4 scores who were at high risk of developing cardiovascular complications.","['clinical trial', 'diabetes complications', 'liver', 'type 2 diabetes']",2023-05-22
37814892,Influence of Baseline Diastolic Blood Pressure on the Effects of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering: Results From the STEP Randomized Trial.,"The STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) trial demonstrated that intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering has cardiovascular benefits. However, the influence of baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular outcomes has not been fully elucidated. We performed a post hoc analysis of the STEP trial. Participants were randomly allocated to intensive (110 to <130 mm Hg) or standard (130 to <150 mm Hg) treatment groups. The effects of intensive SBP lowering on the primary composite outcome (stroke, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure, coronary revascularization, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death), major adverse cardiac event (a composite of the individual components of the primary outcome except for stroke), and all-cause mortality were analyzed according to baseline DBP as both a categorical and a continuous variable. The 8259 participants had a mean age of 66.2±4.8 years, and 46.5% were men. Participants with lower DBP were slightly older and had greater histories of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Within each baseline DBP quartile, the mean achieved DBP was lower in the intensive versus standard group. The effects of intensive SBP lowering were not modified by baseline DBP as a continuous variable or as a categorical variable (quartiles, or <70, 70 to <80, and ≥80 mm Hg; all P value for interaction >0.05). The beneficial effects of intensive SBP lowering on cardiovascular outcomes were unaffected by baseline DBP. Lower DBP should not be an obstacle to intensive SBP control.

37814889,"Body Mass Index, Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk.","Obesity is a well-established risk factor for both adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is not known whether APOs are mediators or markers of the obesity-CVD relationship. This study examined the association between body mass index, APOs, and postpartum CVD risk factors. The sample included adults from the nuMoM2b (Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-To-Be) Heart Health Study who were enrolled in their first trimester (6 weeks-13 weeks 6 days gestation) from 8 United States sites. Participants had a follow-up visit at 3.7 years postpartum. APOs, which included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and gestational diabetes, were centrally adjudicated. Mediation analyses estimated the association between early pregnancy body mass index and postpartum CVD risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes) and the proportion mediated by each APO adjusted for demographics and baseline health behaviors, psychosocial stressors, and CVD risk factor levels. Among 4216 participants enrolled, mean±SD maternal age was 27±6 years. Early pregnancy prevalence of overweight was 25%, and obesity was 22%. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occurred in 15%, preterm birth in 8%, small-for-gestational-age birth in 11%, and gestational diabetes in 4%. Early pregnancy obesity, compared with normal body mass index, was associated with significantly higher incidence of postpartum hypertension (adjusted odds ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.10-1.18]), hyperlipidemia (1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1.14]), and diabetes (1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.04]) even after adjustment for baseline CVD risk factor levels. APOs were associated with higher incidence of postpartum hypertension (1.97 [95% CI, 1.61-2.40]) and hyperlipidemia (1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67]). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy mediated a small proportion of the association between obesity and incident hypertension (13% [11%-15%]) and did not mediate associations with incident hyperlipidemia or diabetes. There was no significant mediation by preterm birth or small-for-gestational-age birth. There was heterogeneity across APO subtypes in their association with postpartum CVD risk factors and mediation of the association between early pregnancy obesity and postpartum CVD risk factors. However, only a small or nonsignificant proportion of the association between obesity and CVD risk factors was mediated by any of the APOs, suggesting APOs are a marker of prepregnancy CVD risk and not a predominant cause of postpartum CVD risk.","['body mass index', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'hypertension', 'obesity', 'pregnancy']",
37814876,[Quercetin improves pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats by regulating the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB pathway].,"To explore the mechanism through which quercetin improves pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Rat models of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension were established by exposure to hypoxia for 8-10 h each day (6 days a week for 4 weeks), and before each hypoxic exposure, the rats were given intragastric administration of 100 mg/kg quercetin or saline. After the treatments, the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of the rats were recorded. The right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) was measured to evaluate right ventricular hypertrophy. HE staining was used to observe the remodeling of the pulmonary arterioles. The right cardiac function of the rats was evaluated by ultrasound. The protein levels of HMGB1, RAGE, NF-κB, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 in the lung tissue of the rats were detected using Western blotting. Compared with the rats maintained in normoxia, the rats with chronic hypoxic exposure showed significantly increased RVHI and RVSP (P<0.01), which were obviously lowered by quercetin treatment (P<0.01). HE staining showed significant pulmonary artery wall thickening with reduced lumen diameter in hypoxia group, and quercetin treatment effectively improved pulmonary vascular remodeling. Ultrasound examination revealed a significantly increased RVFW and a lowered PAT/PET ratio in hypoxia group (P<0.01), and such changes were ameliorated by quercetin treatment (P<0.01). Chronic hypoxia significantly increased the protein expressions of HMGB1 (P<0.01), RAGE, NF-κB and Bcl-2 (P<0.01) and lowered the protein expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 (P<0.01); Quercetin treatment obviously lowered the protein expressions of HMGB1, NF-κB (P<0.05), RAGE (P<0.01) and (P<0.05) and increased the expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 in the rat models (P<0.01). Quercetin improves pulmonary hypertension in rats possibly by promoting apoptosis through the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB pathway.","['pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'pulmonary arteriole remodeling', 'quercetin']",
37814855,What Can Biologic Aging Tell Us About the Effects of Mental Stress on Vascular Health.,"Cardiovascular disease is often a disease of aging. Considerable advances in our understanding of the biological mechanisms of aging have been made; yet, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States urging a continued search for novel risk factors to target for preventing and treating disease. Mental stress (MS) is emerging as an important risk factor, and while progress has been made in understanding the link between MS and cardiovascular disease, the precise mechanisms of a putative causal relationship require greater clarification. In the current review, we (1) summarize our current understanding of the pathological effects of MS on vascular health; (2) describe important aspects of the pathobiology of vascular aging including inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as novel processes such as genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and nutrient signal pathways; (3) highlight similarities in the downstream biologic effects of aging and MS on vascular health with an emphasis on cellular and molecular processes that could be used to develop novel prognostic markers and treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease; (4) discuss lifestyle and pharmacological methods that target indicators of aging whose role could be translated into approaches managing the effects of MS; and (5) outline important future steps that should be considered in this area of research including the need for prospective clinical trials and for creating greater collaboration between preclinical aging researchers and clinical investigators managing MS.","['aging', 'biologic indicators', 'endothelial function', 'mental stress', 'vascular health']",
