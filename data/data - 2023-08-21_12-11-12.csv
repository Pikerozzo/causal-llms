37599086,The Prognostic Impact of In-Hospital Major Bleeding and Recurrence of Myocardial Infarction during Acute Phase after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Acute Myocardial Infarction.,"Both recurrent myocardial infarction (ReMI) and bleeding events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were reportedly associated with increased mortality. To date, the prognostic impact of these events on subsequent outcomes in East Asians is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of bleeding or thrombotic events during acute phase on subsequent mortality and time-dependent change of the impact in patients with AMI undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with AMI (n=12,093). The patients who did not undergo emergent PCI were excluded. In addition, the patients registered before 2003 were excluded because the data of bleeding severity was not obtained. Eligible patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of major bleeding within 7 days of PCI, and the same approach was performed for ReMI within 7 days of PCI. The endpoint of this study was all-cause death. We assessed the impact of major bleeding and ReMI, which occurred within 7 days of index PCI, on the subsequent clinical outcomes up to 5 years.A total of 6,769 patients were found to be eligible. All-cause death occurred in 898 (13.3%) patients during a median follow-up period of 1,726 [511-1,840] days. After adjustment for multiple confounders, major bleeding in 7 days from index PCI was independently associated with higher 30-day and 30-day to 1-year mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.06 [1.45-2.92] p＜0.001, OR: 2.03 [1.28-3.15] p=0.002), whereas ReMI was not (OR: 1.93 [0.92-3.80] p=0.07, OR: 0.81 [0.24-2.03] p=0.68). Major bleeding and ReMI did not affect mortality between 1 and 5 years (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32 [0.77-2.26] p=0.31, HR: 0.48 [0.12-1.94] p=0.30).Major bleeding in 7 days from admission was independently associated with higher 30-day and 1-year mortality but not during 1-5 years. ReMI did not affect mortality in all phases. We should be more concerned about bleeding event during acute phase after PCI.","['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Bleeding', 'East Asian', 'Recurrent myocardial infarction']",,['heart attack']
37598910,AATS 2023: Left ventricular restoration with scar exclusion in the surgical treatment for ischemic heart failure.,"Post-infarction myocardial scar as detected by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is associated with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and negatively affects the prognosis. We sought to analyze the impact of left ventricular restoration (LVR) with asynergic scar exclusion on long-term outcomes for patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF).From January 2005, 134 consecutive patients with IHF underwent scar-exclusive LVR. Among the 131 survivors, 108 patients had paired late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)-CMR preoperatively and one year after, and represent the study population. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether their post-LVR residual percentage of scarred LV perimeter was <35% (%Scar <35; n = 55) or more (%Scar ≥35; n = 53). We compared the two groups, by looking at LGE-CMR outcomes, and at long-term survival and cardiac event (hospitalization for cardiac causes)-free survival.Postoperative LV end-systolic volume index decreased significantly and ejection fraction increased with significant increase in stroke volume index (P < .05 for both). LV diastolic function of the left atrial volume index was significantly improved in patients with residual %Scar <35 than in those with %Scar ≥35 (P interaction = 0.005). Median survival in patients with residual %Scar <35 and ≥ 35 were 8.3 (4.5-12.2) years and 6.8 (1.8-11.8) years respectively (P = .106). Median cardiac event-free survival in patients with %Scar <35 and ≥ 35 were 8.0 (3.9-12.1) years and 4.8 (0.8-8.8) years respectively (P < .001).Scar-exclusive LVR yielded sustainable improvement in LV function and favorable long-term survival regardless of the extent of residual scar. The LVR should be performed to attain scar exclusion in the surgical treatment for IHF, which in turn might protectively affect LV diastolic function and cardiac event-free survival.","['Cardiac magnetic resonance', 'Ischemic heart failure', 'Left ventricular restoration', 'Postoperative residual scar', 'Scar exclusion']",2023-04-20,['heart attack']
37598907,Clinical outcomes of coronary intravascular lithotripsy in patients with stent failure (COIL registry).,"Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment of calcified de novo coronary lesions. Safety data on the use of IVL within stented segments are lacking. We sought to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and long-term outcomes of IVL in patients with stent failure.This was a retrospective multi-centre registry that included consecutive patients with stent failure who had undergone IVL treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was procedural success defined as residual stenosis <30% (determined by quantitative coronary angiography analysis) in patients who survived hospital admission without in-hospital adverse events. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined as the composite endpoints of cardiovascular death, spontaneous myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularisation at one-year follow up.102 patients were included in this study. Mean age was 73 ± 9 years and 81% were male. The duration from previous stent implantation and IVL treatment was 24 (interquartile range 7-76) months, of which 10.8% received IVL for acute under-expanded stent. IVL treatment allowed significant improvement in both minimal lumen diameter (1.14 ± 0.60 to 2.53 ± 0.59, P < 0.001) and degree of stenosis (66.8 ± 19.9 to 20.3 ± 11.3%, P < 0.001). The rate of procedural success was 78.4% (80/102 of patients). The one-year MACE was 15.7%. Ostial disease (HR 5.16; 95% CI 1.19 to 22.33; P = 0.028) and lesion length (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10; P = 0.010) were independently associated with one-year MACE.In patients with stent failure, IVL is a safe and feasible treatment for this high-risk group.","['Calcifications', 'Lithotripsy', 'Restenosis', 'Stent failure']",2023-06-12,['heart attack']
37598810,Adaptation of closed-chest infarction porcine model to adult Pannon minipigs.,"The aim of the recent study was to collect data on the genotype characteristics of the Hungarian self-bred Pannon minipigs by adapting a standardized infarct model procedure. Closed chest AMI was induced by balloon occlusion for 90 min in the left anterior descendent coronary artery (LAD) in 24 adult intact female minipigs followed by reperfusion. To assess the left ventricular (LV) function, serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) was performed prior to the experimental procedure, on day 3 post-AMI (72 ± 12 h), and at 1 month follow-up (Day 30 ± 2 days). Compared to baseline cMRI scans the end-diastolic volume (EDV) was increased on days 3 and 30 On day 3 the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decreased significantly but there was no statistical difference between the baseline and day 30 measurements. Cardiac output, stroke volume, and end-systolic volume significantly were increased compared to baseline on day 30 A high percentage (54%) of malignant arrhythmias occurred during the AMI procedure, with a 25% mortality rate. The compensatory capacity of the Pannon minipig heart is excellent therefore the use of different cardiac parameters and invasive measurements is advisable in chronic pharmacological experiments to complement cMRI data.","['Cardiac catheterization', 'Closed-chest myocardial infarction', 'Large animal model', 'Minipig', 'cMRI']",2023-07-19,['heart attack']
37598671,Evaluation of time to onset and outcome of cardiac adverse events associated with nilotinib using post-marketing surveillance.,"Cardiac adverse events (CAEs) have become a concern as serious adverse events of nilotinib administration. No reports have described the incidence of CAEs associated with nilotinib in Japanese patients.Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate the risk of nilotinib-induced CAEs, time to onset, incidence rates, and post hoc outcomes using the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database.We analysed data for the period between April 2004 and March 2022. Data on CAEs were extracted, and relative risk of adverse events (AEs) was estimated using the reporting odds ratio (ROR).We analysed 2,021,907 reports and identified 3,545 reports of AEs caused by nilotinib. Of these, 511 reports involved CAEs. Signals were detected for 19 CAEs. Of these, electrocardiogram QT prolonged was the most frequently reported (30.9%). Fatal outcomes were observed in eight AEs: cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade. Of these, acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade exhibited mortality rates >10%. A histogram of median times to onset showed nilotinib-associated AEs occurring 3-485 days after nilotinib administration.We focused on CAEs caused by nilotinib as post-marketing AEs. Some cases resulted in serious outcomes. Patients should be monitored for signs of onset of these AEs not only at the start of administration, but for a long period of time.",[],2023-05-11,['heart attack']
