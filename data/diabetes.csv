37814928,"Efficacy of finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and altered markers of liver steatosis and fibrosis: A FIDELITY subgroup analysis.","Investigating the effect of finerenone on liver function, cardiovascular and kidney composite outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, stratified by their risk of liver steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. Post hoc analysis stratified patients (N = 13 026) by liver fibrosis and enzymes: high risk of steatosis (hepatic steatosis index >36); elevated transaminases [alanine transaminase (ALT) >33 (males) and >25 IU/L (females)]; and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index scores >3.25, >2.67 and >1.30. Liver enzymes were assessed by changes in ALT, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Composite kidney outcome was defined as onset of kidney failure, sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate decline ≥57% from baseline over ≥4 weeks or kidney death. Composite cardiovascular outcome was defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure. ALT, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels were consistent between treatment groups and remained stable throughout. Finerenone consistently reduced the risk of composite kidney outcome, irrespective of altered liver tests. Higher FIB-4 score was associated with higher incidence rates of composite cardiovascular outcome. Finerenone reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular outcome versus placebo in FIB-4 subgroups by 52% (>3.25), 39% (>2.67) and 24% (>1.30) (p values for interaction = .01, .13 and .03, respectively). Finerenone has neutral effects on liver parameters in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes. Finerenone showed robust and consistent kidney benefits in patients with altered liver tests, and profound cardiovascular benefits even in patients with higher FIB-4 scores who were at high risk of developing cardiovascular complications.","['clinical trial', 'diabetes complications', 'liver', 'type 2 diabetes']",2023-05-22
37814918,Fulminant type 1 diabetes: Focusing on triggering factors.,"Fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1D) is a novel type of type 1 diabetes that is caused by extremely rapid destruction of the pancreatic β cells. Early diagnosis or prediction of FT1D is critical for the prevention or timely treatment of diabetes ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening. Understanding its triggers or promoting factors plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of FT1D. In this review, we summarised the various triggering factors of FT1D, including susceptibility genes, immunological factors (cellular and humoural immunity), immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, pregnancy, viral infections, and vaccine inoculation. This review provides the basis for future research into the pathogenetic mechanisms that regulate FT1D development and progression to further improve the prognosis and clinical management of patients with FT1D.","['FT1D', 'HLA', 'allele', 'autoantibodies', 'epidemiology', 'genetics']",2023-06-20
37814892,Influence of Baseline Diastolic Blood Pressure on the Effects of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering: Results From the STEP Randomized Trial.,"The STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) trial demonstrated that intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering has cardiovascular benefits. However, the influence of baseline diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the effects of intensive blood pressure lowering on cardiovascular outcomes has not been fully elucidated. We performed a post hoc analysis of the STEP trial. Participants were randomly allocated to intensive (110 to <130 mm Hg) or standard (130 to <150 mm Hg) treatment groups. The effects of intensive SBP lowering on the primary composite outcome (stroke, acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure, coronary revascularization, atrial fibrillation, and cardiovascular death), major adverse cardiac event (a composite of the individual components of the primary outcome except for stroke), and all-cause mortality were analyzed according to baseline DBP as both a categorical and a continuous variable. The 8259 participants had a mean age of 66.2±4.8 years, and 46.5% were men. Participants with lower DBP were slightly older and had greater histories of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Within each baseline DBP quartile, the mean achieved DBP was lower in the intensive versus standard group. The effects of intensive SBP lowering were not modified by baseline DBP as a continuous variable or as a categorical variable (quartiles, or <70, 70 to <80, and ≥80 mm Hg; all P value for interaction >0.05). The beneficial effects of intensive SBP lowering on cardiovascular outcomes were unaffected by baseline DBP. Lower DBP should not be an obstacle to intensive SBP control.

37814889,"Body Mass Index, Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk.","Obesity is a well-established risk factor for both adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is not known whether APOs are mediators or markers of the obesity-CVD relationship. This study examined the association between body mass index, APOs, and postpartum CVD risk factors. The sample included adults from the nuMoM2b (Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-To-Be) Heart Health Study who were enrolled in their first trimester (6 weeks-13 weeks 6 days gestation) from 8 United States sites. Participants had a follow-up visit at 3.7 years postpartum. APOs, which included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age birth, and gestational diabetes, were centrally adjudicated. Mediation analyses estimated the association between early pregnancy body mass index and postpartum CVD risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes) and the proportion mediated by each APO adjusted for demographics and baseline health behaviors, psychosocial stressors, and CVD risk factor levels. Among 4216 participants enrolled, mean±SD maternal age was 27±6 years. Early pregnancy prevalence of overweight was 25%, and obesity was 22%. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occurred in 15%, preterm birth in 8%, small-for-gestational-age birth in 11%, and gestational diabetes in 4%. Early pregnancy obesity, compared with normal body mass index, was associated with significantly higher incidence of postpartum hypertension (adjusted odds ratio, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.10-1.18]), hyperlipidemia (1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1.14]), and diabetes (1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.04]) even after adjustment for baseline CVD risk factor levels. APOs were associated with higher incidence of postpartum hypertension (1.97 [95% CI, 1.61-2.40]) and hyperlipidemia (1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.67]). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy mediated a small proportion of the association between obesity and incident hypertension (13% [11%-15%]) and did not mediate associations with incident hyperlipidemia or diabetes. There was no significant mediation by preterm birth or small-for-gestational-age birth. There was heterogeneity across APO subtypes in their association with postpartum CVD risk factors and mediation of the association between early pregnancy obesity and postpartum CVD risk factors. However, only a small or nonsignificant proportion of the association between obesity and CVD risk factors was mediated by any of the APOs, suggesting APOs are a marker of prepregnancy CVD risk and not a predominant cause of postpartum CVD risk.","['body mass index', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'hypertension', 'obesity', 'pregnancy']",
37814878,[Lifetide biofeedback intervention in type 2 diabetic patients: a pilot observation].,"To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of lifetide biofeedback intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We analyzed the changes in average blood glucose, estimated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in 5 patients with T2DM undergoing lifetide biofeedback intervention without the use of hypoglycemic drugs. A transient blood glucose monitoring system was used for drug withdrawal management during the intervention. Compared with those before the intervention, the average blood glucose and fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels showed no significant changes after the intervention without using hypoglycemic drugs (P>0.05), but the estimated HbA1c was significantly decreased after the intervention (P<0.05). Two patients achieved complete remission, two showed partial remission, and one had substantially improved blood glucose levels. One patient showed a marked increase in extremity temperature after the intervention (P<0.05). Another patient had a significantly increased heart rate variability index (P<0.05) without obvious changes in heart rate after the intervention (P>0.05). By reestablishing the balance in autonomic nervous system regulation and enhancing peripheral microcirculation, lifetide biofeedback intervention helps to maintain stable blood glucose levels, achieve disease remission, and reduce the occurrence of complications in T2DM patients after discontinuation of hypoglycemic drugs without changing their lifestyles.","['lifetide biofeedback', 'remission', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']",
