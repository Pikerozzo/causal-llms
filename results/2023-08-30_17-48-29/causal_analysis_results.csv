37622589,Twenty-five years of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia: a look back and a look forward.,"This article will discuss the past, present, and future of ventricular tachycardia ablation and the continuing contribution of the Europace journal as the platform for publication of milestone research papers in this field of ventricular tachycardia ablation.",00:01:16
37636318,Left Atrial Thrombus in the Setting of Mitral Stenosis.,"A 56-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with exertional shortness of breath. Echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance, and computed tomography showed mitral stenosis and a left atrial thrombus. Left atrial thrombus formation is a well-known complication of severe mitral stenosis that can lead to systemic thromboembolism. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, left atrial thrombus resection, and left atrial appendage closure that resulted in significant improvement in breathing.",00:23:26
37644319,Role of echocardiography in patients treated with immune checkpoints inhibitors.,"Immune-related adverse events occurring in the heart (cardiac immune-related adverse events; irAEs) by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) include myocarditis, arrhythmia, conduction disturbance, pericardial diseases, and takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Cardiac irAEs are rare but life-threatening. In cardio-oncology, the study of cardiac disorders caused by cancer treatment has recently attracted attention, and such studies may elucidate the pathophysiology of cardiac irAEs and contribute to management strategies. This review discusses the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cardiac irAEs and the role of echocardiography in patients treated with ICIs.",00:32:43
37622573,Advancing the science of management of arrhythmic disease in children and adult congenital heart disease patients within the last 25 years.,"This review article reflects how publications in EP Europace have contributed to advancing the science of management of arrhythmic disease in children and adult patients with congenital heart disease within the last 25 years. A special focus is directed to congenital atrioventricular (AV) block, the use of pacemakers, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators in the young with and without congenital heart disease, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, mapping and ablation technology, and understanding of cardiac genomics to untangle arrhythmic sudden death in the young.",00:20:56
37622576,Risk stratification of sudden cardiac death: a review.,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is responsible for several millions of deaths every year and remains a major health problem. To reduce this burden, diagnosing and identification of high-risk individuals and disease-specific risk stratification are essential. Treatment strategies include treatment of the underlying disease with lifestyle advice and drugs and decisions to implant a primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and perform ablation of the ventricles and novel treatment modalities such as left cardiac sympathetic denervation in rare specific primary electric diseases such as long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. This review summarizes the current knowledge on SCD risk according to underlying heart disease and discusses the future of SCD prevention.",00:06:27
37637567,Unexplained Hypercalcemia: A Clue to Adrenal Insufficiency.,"Hypercalcemia secondary to adrenal insufficiency is a rare condition, but it must be recognized and treated promptly to prevent complications such as kidney damage, bone loss, and cardiac arrhythmias. The co-occurrence of hypercalcemia and adrenal insufficiency can be seen in some rare conditions such as sarcoidosis, however, hypercalcemia as a direct consequence of adrenal insufficiency is well documented in the literature but seldom recognized and often remains underdiagnosed. Symptoms of hypercalcemia in this setting include fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, confusion, and dehydration. Treatment typically involves correcting the underlying adrenal insufficiency with hormone replacement therapy, along with measures to lower calcium levels in the blood, such as hydration. In this article, we report the case of a patient presenting with hypercalcemia secondary to adrenal insufficiency.",00:40:48
