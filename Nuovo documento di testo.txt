CONTEXT:
 advancement in causal inference is crucial, for sound decision-making, reliable AI systems,
potential strong AI and AGI


OBJECTIVE:
 assessment of LLM causal analysis capabilities from text for aiding human efforts,
 focus on causal discovery (finding causal graph)
		(small theory introduction)
 
SOTA:
 from DATA (constraint-based and score-based methods)
 with expert (knwoledge-based)
 LLM-based (metadata-based)


SOLUTION:
 GPT API, prompt eng.
 flow "Data collection -> causal analysis -> graph plotting"
    - Data collection:
          pubmed API, get_ids, get_data, clean_data

    - Causal analysis:
          gpt_NER, gpt_causal_discovery

    - Graph plotting:
          libraries & packages, normalize_edges, cycle_check, plot
 
BENCHMARKS:
