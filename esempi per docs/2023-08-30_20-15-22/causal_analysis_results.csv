37539239,Dexamethasone for delayed edema after intracerebral hemorrhage： To be or not to be?,"The pathogenesis of delayed cerebral edema after intracerebral hemorrhage is still unclear. In this case report, we speculate that the formation of subdural effusion or hemorrhage is associated with delayed cerebral edema. By referring to the treatment plan of chronic subdural hematoma, adding dexamethasone to routine medication, certain therapeutic effect has been achieved. Dexamethasone may maintain the stability of blood-brain barrier by directly increasing the expression of ZO-1, and reduce the neuroinflammatory response caused by NF-κB pathway by upregulating KLF2 expression, ultimately reducing nerve injury through multiple pathways.",00:28:00
37621982,Papillary Glioneuronal Tumor Masquerading as Malignant Brain Tumors: A Case Report.,"Papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGNT) is a low-grade biphasic tumor that is composed of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial cells and synaptophysin-positive neurons. We report a case of PGNT occurring in the right occipital lobe of a 48-year-old woman who presented with acute headache and left homonymous hemianopsia, the latter of which was difficult to distinguish from malignant brain tumors because of peritumoral brain edema, intratumoral hemorrhage, and intraoperative fluorescence staining. PGNT should be included as one of the differential diagnoses in cases where the tumor shows hemorrhagic change despite decreased perfusion in arterial spin labeling MRI.",00:36:36
37546055,Fetal Inferior Vena Cava Thrombosis Associated With Non-Immune Hydrops Fetalis and Maternal Mirror Syndrome.,"Prenatal assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) should be considered in pregnancies with atypical presentations of fetal ascites and placentomegaly. We examine a case of a 25-year-old gravida 2 para 1 type 1 diabetic female at 29 and 4/7 weeks' gestation. Ultrasound (US) showed fetal ascites and placentomegaly with increased middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) suspicious of fetal anemia. Cordocentesis with intrauterine transfusion briefly resolved the fetal ascites, though the mother developed pulmonary edema and pleural effusion, suggestive of mirror syndrome. On US, fetal ascites returned and progressed to non-immune hydrops fetalis, prompting delivery. Neonatal US revealed a heterogenous and calcified thrombus within the IVC.",01:13:00
37529521,Malignant Hypercalcemia: A Rare Etiology of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome.,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare and severe neurotoxic encephalopathic state characterized by variable neurologic manifestations ranging from headache and confusion to seizures, coma, and reversible subcortical vasogenic edema on imaging. PRES is commonly induced by chronic renal failure, hypertension, chemotherapeutic drugs, and eclampsia. PRES induced by hypercalcemia is uncommon and not widely underlined in the literature. We underline a case of a 61-year-old female diagnosed with advanced breast carcinoma presented with altered sensorium and generalized limb weakness. She was found to have malignant hypercalcemia, and brain imaging demonstrated subcortical vasogenic edema in the occipital and frontal lobe, suggestive of PRES. Her condition gradually improved after the treatment of hypercalcemia.",00:51:23
37614263,"Gliosarcoma Invading the Temporal Bone, Temporalis Muscle, and Skull Base.","Gliosarcoma (GS) is a primary central nervous system tumor. It is an unusual type of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and rarely invades the skull base. It has a biomorphic tissue pattern with rapid alternation zones of glial and mesenchymal differentiation. We report the case of a 62-year-old male who presented with a one-month history of unsteady gait associated with dizziness. Brain MRI showed a right temporal mass that invaded the skull base with perilesional edema and a significant mass effect on the right lateral ventricle. The patient underwent a right-sided frontotemporal craniotomy with gross total resection. The pathology confirmed the diagnosis of GS. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful recovery with no complications and was discharged two days post-surgery.",00:27:37
37550823,A Rare Case of Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Abscess Mimicking Brain Tumor in an Immunocompetent Patient.,"Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is a type of bacteria that typically infects the pulmonary system, and NTM-central nervous system (CNS) infection, which occurs in the brain, is a very rare disease. A 64-year-old female patient presented with seizures as the main symptom and was found to have a mass of less than 1 cm in the right temporal lobe with accompanying edema. Although diseases such as tumor metastasis and parasitic cyst were suspected, the patient underwent a surgical resection, and NTM-CNS infection with abscess was diagnosed through biopsy. Antibiotic treatment was initiated after surgery, and the patient has been followed up without any significant symptoms. In this report, we review a rare case of NTM-CNS infection and discuss the understanding and treatment of this disease.",00:31:50
37637566,Severe Hyperammonemia Due to Fecal Bowel Obstruction With a Congenital Portosystemic Shunt Resulting in Refractory Status Epilepticus and Cerebral Edema.,"Hyperammonemic encephalopathy is a neurological emergency that can lead to seizures and cerebral edema. Although early interventions have been suggested, no clear criteria have been established. Herein, we report a case of severe non-hepatic hyperammonemia resulting in refractory status epilepticus within a day. A 79-year-old woman presented with acute altered mental status. Initial evaluation revealed septic shock and hyperammonemia due to fecal bowel obstruction with congenital portosystemic shunt. The patient was unresponsive to medical treatment and developed refractory status epilepticus. After surgical drainage with colostomy and a decrease in ammonia level, the patient developed cerebral edema and did not recover from the coma. Severe hyperammonemia warrants early intervention, especially in critically ill patients, with treatment of the cause and augmented removal of ammonia with renal replacement therapy.",00:46:08
37637532,Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy-Related Inflammation (CAA-ri): Presentation at an Unusual Age.,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is a less common but aggressive manifestation of CAA caused by an autoimmune reaction to the amyloid-beta (Ab) deposits in affected vessels. Here, we report the case of a 96-year-old patient, with a history of Alzheimer's disease, who presented to our hospital due to a sudden onset of high-intensity holocranial headache followed by dysarthria, left hemiplegia, and gaze deviation to the right. MRI of the brain was performed, which revealed a heterogeneous hypointense signal on the right frontal T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences, with an asymmetric hyperintensity surrounding the lesion compatible with perilesional vasogenic edema. Given the clinical radiographic findings, a diagnosis of CAA-ri was established and immediate treatment with intravenous corticosteroids was started, with a rapid clinical response and remarkable improvement in follow-up neuroimaging.",00:53:47
37582615,Dramatic Response to Anti-IL-6 Receptor Therapy in Children With Life-Threatening Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein-Associated Disease.,"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is an immune-mediated neuroinflammatory disorder leading to demyelination of the CNS. Interleukin (IL)-6 receptor blockade is under study in relapsing MOGAD as a preventative strategy, but little is known about the role of such treatment for acute MOGAD attacks. We discuss the cases of a 7-year-old boy and a 15-year-old adolescent boy with severe acute CNS demyelination and malignant cerebral edema with early brain herniation associated with clearly positive serum titers of MOG-IgG, whose symptoms were incompletely responsive to standard acute therapies (high-dose steroids, IV immunoglobulins (IVIGs), and therapeutic plasma exchange). Both boys improved quickly with IL-6 receptor inhibition, administered as tocilizumab. Both patients have experienced remarkable neurologic recovery. We propose that IL-6 receptor therapies might also be considered in acute severe life-threatening presentations of MOGAD.",00:24:17
