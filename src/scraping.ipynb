      "Retinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common pathological process responsible for cellular damage in glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy. Metformin is a biguanide drug that exerts strong effects on multiple diseases. This study aims to evaluate the protective effect of metformin against retinal I/R injury and its underlying mechanism. I/R induced reduction in retina thickness and cell number in ganglion cell layer, and metformin alleviated I/R-induced retinal injury. Both retinal I/R and simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SIR) in R28 cells down-regulated expression of mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn2 and OPA1, which led to mitochondrial fission. Metformin also alleviated damage in R28 cells, and reversed the alteration in Mfn2 and OPA1, mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption-induced by I/R or SIR as well. Intriguingly, inhibition of AMPK by compound C or siRNA prevented metformin-mediated up-regulation of Mfn2 and OPA1. Compound C and knockdown of Mfn2 or OPA1 dramatically alleviated the protective effect of metformin against intracellular ROS generation, MMP disruption, mitochondrial fission and loss of RGCs in ganglion cell layer-induced by SIR or I/R. Moreover, scavenging mitochondrial ROS (mito-ROS) by mito-TEMPO exerted the similar protection against I/R-induced retinal injury or SIR-induced damage in R28 cells as metformin. Our data show for the first time that metformin protects against retinal I/R injury through AMPK-mediated mitochondrial fusion and the decreased mito-ROS generation. These findings might also repurpose metformin as a therapeutic agent for retinal I/R injury.\n",

      "Apoptosis is a complex and highly self-regulating form of cell death, which is an important cause of the continuous decline in ventricular function and is widely involved in the occurrence and development of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocarditis. Endoplasmic reticulum stress plays a crucial role in apoptosis-inducing. Accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins causes cells to undergo a stress response called unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR initially has a cardioprotective effect. Nevertheless, prolonged and severe ER stress will lead up to apoptosis of stressed cells. Non-coding RNA is a type of RNA that does not code proteins. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that non-coding RNAs are involved in regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cardiomyocyte injury and apoptosis. In this study, the effects of miRNA and LncRNA on endoplasmic reticulum stress in various heart diseases were mainly discussed to clarify their protective effects and potential therapeutic strategies for apoptosis.\n",

      "The response to ischemia in peripheral artery disease (PAD) depends on compensatory neovascularization and coordination of tissue regeneration. Identifying novel mechanisms regulating these processes is critical to the development of nonsurgical treatments for PAD. E-selectin is an adhesion molecule that mediates cell recruitment during neovascularization. Therapeutic priming of ischemic limb tissues with intramuscular E-selectin gene therapy promotes angiogenesis and reduces tissue loss in a murine hindlimb gangrene model. In this study, we evaluated the effects of E-selectin gene therapy on skeletal muscle recovery, specifically focusing on exercise performance and myofiber regeneration. C57BL/6J mice were treated with intramuscular E-selectin/adeno-associated virus serotype 2/2 gene therapy (E-sel/AAV) or LacZ/AAV2/2 (LacZ/AAV) as control and then subjected to femoral artery coagulation. Recovery of hindlimb perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging and muscle function by treadmill exhaustion and grip strength testing. After three postoperative weeks, hindlimb muscle was harvested for immunofluorescence analysis. At all postoperative time points, mice treated with E-sel/AAV had improved hindlimb perfusion and exercise capacity. E-sel/AAV gene therapy also increased the coexpression of MyoD and Ki-67 in skeletal muscle progenitors and the proportion of Myh7+ myofibers. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that in addition to improving reperfusion, intramuscular E-sel/AAV gene therapy enhances the regeneration of ischemic skeletal muscle with a corresponding benefit on exercise performance. These results suggest a potential role for E-sel/AAV gene therapy as a nonsurgical adjunct in patients with life-limiting PAD.\n",

      "Cardiac arrest (CA) and concomitant post-CA syndrome lead to a lethal condition characterized by systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxygen (O2 ) supply during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the key to success in resuscitation, but sustained hyperoxia can produce toxic effects post CA. However, only few studies have investigated the optimal duration and dosage of O2 administration. Herein, we aimed to determine whether high concentrations of O2 at resuscitation are beneficial or harmful. After rats were resuscitated from the 10-min asphyxia, mechanical ventilation was restarted at an FIO2 of 1.0 or 0.3. From 10 min after initiating CPR, FIO2 of both groups were maintained at 0.3. Bio-physiological parameters including O2 consumption (VO2 ) and mRNA gene expression in multiple organs were evaluated. The FIO2 0.3 group decreased VO2 , delayed the time required to achieve peak MAP, lowered ejection fraction (75.1 ± 3.3% and 59.0 ± 5.7% with FIO2 1.0 and 0.3, respectively; p < .05), and increased blood lactate levels (4.9 ± 0.2 mmol/L and 5.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L, respectively; p < .05) at 10 min after CPR. FIO2 0.3 group had significant increases in hypoxia-inducible factor, inflammatory, and apoptosis-related mRNA gene expression in the brain. Likewise, significant upregulations of hypoxia-inducible factor and apoptosis-related gene expression were observed in the FIO2 0.3 group in the heart and lungs. Insufficient O2 supplementation in the first 10 min of resuscitation could prolong ischemia, and may result in unfavorable biological responses 2 h after CA. Faster recovery from the impairment of O2 metabolism might contribute to the improvement of hemodynamics during the early post-resuscitation phase; therefore, it may be reasonable to provide the maximum feasible O2 concentrations during CPR.\n",

      "Mitochondrial fusion is an important process that protects the myocardium. However, mitochondrial fusion is often inhibited in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IR). The upstream mechanism of this effect is unclear. Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (NR4A1) can aggravate myocardial IR and increase the level of oxidative stress, thereby affecting mitochondrial function and morphology. Inhibiting NR4A1 can improve oxidative stress levels and mitochondrial function and morphology, thereby reducing IR. Downregulating NR4A1 increases the expression level of the mitochondrial fusion-related protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), which is associated with these benefits. Inhibiting OPA1 expression with MYLS22 abrogates the effects of NR4A1 downregulation on IR. Furthermore, NR4A1 disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and activates the STING and NF-κB pathways. Insufficient mitochondrial fusion and increased apoptosis and inflammatory reactions worsen irreversible damage to cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, NR4A1 can exacerbate IR by inhibiting OPA1, causing mitochondrial damage.\n",

      "The revascularization of grafted tissues is a complicated and non-straightforward process, which makes it challenging to perform reconstructive surgery for critical-sized bone defects. This challenge is combined with the low vascularity that results from radiotherapy. This low vascularity could result from ischemia-reperfusion injuries, also known as ischemia which may happen upon grafting. Ischemia may affect the hard tissue during reconstruction, and this can often cause resorption, infections, disfigurement, and malunion. This paper therefore reviews the clinical and experimental application of procedures that were employed to improve the reconstructive surgery process, which would ensure that the vascularity of the tissue is maintained or enhanced. It also presents the key strategies that are implemented to perform tissue engineering within the grafted sites aiming to optimize the microenvironment and to enhance the overall process of neovascularization and angiogenesis. This review reveals that the current strategies, according to the literature, are the seeding of the mature and progenitor cells, use of extracellular matrix (ECM), co-culturing of osteoblasts with the ECM, growth factors and the use of microcapillaries incorporated into the scaffold design. However, due to the unstable and regression-prone capillary structures in bone constructs, further research focusing on creating long-lasting and stable blood vessels is required.\n",

      "Cardioplegia is fundamental to the surgical repair of congenital heart defects by protecting the heart against ischaemia/reperfusion injury, characterised by low cardiac output and troponin release in the early postoperative period. The immature myocardium exhibits structural, physiological and metabolic differences from the adult heart, with a greater sensitivity to calcium overload-mediated injury during reperfusion. Del Nido cardioplegia was designed specifically to protect the immature heart, is widely used in North America and may provide better myocardial protection in children; however, it has not been commercially available in the UK, where most centres use St Thomas' blood cardioplegia. There are no phase 3 clinical trials in children to support one solution over another and this lack of evidence, combined with variations in practice, suggests the presence of clinical equipoise. The best cardioplegia solution for use in children, and the impact of age and other clinical factors remain unknown. In this Hunterian lecture, I propose an evidence-based strategy to improve myocardial protection during cardiac surgery in children through: (1) conducting multicentre clinical trials of established techniques; (2) improving our knowledge of ischaemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of cardioplegic arrest; (3) applying this to drive innovation, moving beyond current cardioplegia solutions; (4) empowering personalised medicine, through combining clinical and genomic data, including ethnic diversity; and (5) understanding the impact of cardioplegic arrest on the late outcomes that matter to patients and their families.\n",

      "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains a major cause of global mortality. In addition to modern interventions, botanical folk medicines have long been used to treat cardiovascular disease, although the efficacy and underlying mechanisms are often unresolved. Aloperine, a bioactive quinolizidine alkaloid isolated from Sophora alopecuroides plants, exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and vasorelaxant properties, but possible antiarrhythmic effects of aloperine in SCD are unclear. Here, we examined whether aloperine protects against ischemia and reperfusion injury-associated lethal ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Rats were divided into sham, control, and aloperine groups, and reperfusion-provoked ventricular arrhythmogenesis, cardiac damage markers, and signaling pathways quantified following left main coronary artery ischemia and reperfusion. In vitro studies of effects of aloperine on hERG and Kv4.3 cardiac voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels were performed using two-electrode voltage clamp analysis of cloned channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Aloperine pretreatment (10 mg/kg) did not affect baseline cardiac electrical stability; yet, it reduced ventricular arrhythmogenesis and susceptibility to SCD (mortality rate: control: 64.3%; aloperine: 0%) induced by reperfusion injury. Aloperine also reduced serum levels of LDH, CK-MB, α-HBDH, and cTnI post-I/R, and stimulated phosphorylation of ventricular ERK1/2 and STAT-3, which are key components of RISK and SAFE signaling pathways. Inhibition of either ERK1/2 (with U0126) or STAT-3 (with Ag490) abolished aloperine-induced anti-arrhythmic effects and ERK1/2 and STAT-3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, while aloperine (100 μM) had no effect on cloned Kv4.3 activity, aloperine (1 μM and up) negative-shifted the voltage dependence of hERG activation by ~10 mV and increased peak hERG current by 35%. Thus, aloperine exerts striking anti-arrhythmic effects against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury-induced severe lethal ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death via the ERK1/2/STAT-3 signaling pathway, with potential additional contribution from increased cardiac myocyte repolarization capacity via augmented hERG activity.\n",

      "The aim of this work was to elucidate the role of GalR2 receptor activation in protecting the rat heart in vivo from I/R damage by a pharmacological peptide agonist WTLNSAGYLLGPβAH-OH (G1) and full-length rat galanin GWTLNSAGYLLGPHAIDNHRSFSDKHGLT-NH2 (G2) using M871, a selective inhibitor of GalR2. The peptides were prepared by the automatic solid phase synthesis using the Fmoc-strategy and purified by HPLC. 40-minute LAD coronary artery occlusion followed by a 60-minute reperfusion was performed. The criteria for damage/protection of the heart were the infarct size (IS) and plasma activity of CK-MB at the end of reperfusion. Intravenous injection of G1 or G2 at an optimal dose of 1 mg/kg at the 5th minute of reperfusion significantly reduced the IS (by 35 and 32%, respectively) and activity of CK-MB at the end of reperfusion (by 43 and 38%, respectively) compared with the control. Administration of M871 (8 mg/kg) 5 min before the onset of reperfusion abolished the effects of G1 on IS and CK-MB activity, returning them to control values. Co-administration of M871 (8 mg/kg) with G2 attenuated protective effect of G2 on both IS and plasma СK-MB activity. However, differences in these parameters between the M871+G2 and G2 groups did not reach statistical significance (P=0.139 and P=0.121, respectively). Thus, GalR2 is the principal receptor subtype that transduces the protective effects of galanin and ligand G1 in myocardial I/R injury. This suggests that GalR2-specific peptide agonists could be used as drug candidates for treating ischemic heart disease.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), and there is no effective therapy. Microenvironmental acidification is generally observed in ischemic tissues. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) can be activated by a decrease in extracellular pH which mediates neuronal IRI. Our previous study demonstrated that, ASIC1a inhibition alleviates renal IRI. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we determined that renal tubule-specific deletion of ASIC1a in mice (ASIC1afl/fl/CDH16cre) attenuated renal IRI, and reduced the expression of NLRP3, ASC, cleaved-caspase-1, GSDMD-N, and IL-1β. Consistent with these in vivo results, inhibition of ASIC1a by the specific inhibitor PcTx-1 protected HK-2 cells from hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury, and suppressed H/R-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, the activation of ASIC1a by either IRI or H/R induced the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65, which translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. Blocking NF-κB by treatment with BAY 11-7082 validated the roles of H/R and acidosis in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This further confirmed that ASIC1a promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which requires the NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, our study suggests that ASIC1a contributes to renal IRI by affecting the NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Therefore, ASIC1a may be a potential therapeutic target for AKI. KEY MESSAGES: Knockout of ASIC1a attenuated renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. ASIC1a promoted the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inhibition of the NF-κB mitigated the NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by ASIC1a.\n",

      "Cardiac arrest (CA) can result in cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion injury and poor neurological outcomes. While bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been shown to have protective effects in brain ischaemic disease, their efficacy can be reduced by the poor oxygen environment. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of hypoxic preconditioned BMSCs (HP-BMSCs) and normoxic BMSCs C (N-BMSCs) in a cardiac arrest rat model by examining their ability to ameliorate cell pyroptosis. The mechanism underlying the process was also explored. Cardiac arrest was induced in rats for 8 min and surviving rats received 1 × 106 normoxic/hypoxic BMSCs or PBS via intracerebroventricular (ICV) transplantation. Neurological function of rats was evaluated using neurological deficit scores (NDSs) and examined for brain pathology. Serum S100B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels and cortical proinflammatory cytokines were measured to evaluate brain injury. Pyroptosis-related proteins in the cortex after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were measured using western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Transplanted BMSCs were tracked using bioluminescence imaging. Results showed significantly better neurological function and neuropathological damage after transplantation with HP-BMSCs. In addition, HP-BMSCs reduced levels of pyroptosis-related proteins in the rat cortex after CPR and significantly reduced levels of biomarkers for brain injury. Mechanistically, HP-BMSCs alleviated brain injury by reducing the expressions of HMGB1, TLR4, NF-κB p65, p38 MAPK and JNK in the cortex. Our study demonstrated that hypoxic preconditioning could enhance the efficacy of BMSCs in alleviating post-resuscitation cortical pyroptosis. This effect may be related to the regulation of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB, MAPK signalling pathways.\n",

      "Ferroptosis was reported to be involved in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI), on which the effects of berberine (BBR) remain unclear. Moreover, based on the critical role of gut microbiota in pleiotropic actions of BBR, we hypothesized that BBR can suppress CIRI-induced ferroptosis by modulating the gut microbiota. In this study, the results showed that BBR obviously attenuated the behavioral deficits of CIRI mice, accompanied with the improved survival rate and neuron damages, as phenocopied by dirty cage experiment. The typical morphological changes in ferroptotic cells and biomarkers of ferroptosis were attenuated in BBR- and its fecal microbiota-treated mice, accompanied by reduced malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species, and the increased glutathione (GSH). BBR was found to alter the gut microbiota of CIRI mice with decreased abundance of Muribaculaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Helicobacteraceae, Streptococcaceae and Tannerellaceae, but elevated Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. KEGG analysis based on the 16S rRNA results indicated that multiple metabolic pathways including ferroptosis and GSH metabolism, were altered by BBR. Oppositely, the antibiotics administration counteracted the protective properties of BBR. Summarily, this study revealed the therapeutic potential of BBR on CIRI via inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis, in which upregulated glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) was possibly involved. Moreover, the BBR-modulated gut microbiota was shown to play the critical role in the underlying mechanism.\n",

      "The apelinergic system, widely expressed and regulates hormone-enzyme secretion, motility, and protective mechanisms of the stomach. This system consists of the apelin receptor (APJ) and two peptides known as apela and apelin. The IR-induced experimental gastric ulcer model, is a well-known and commonly used one that induces hypoxia and causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Expressions of apelin and its receptor APJ are induced by hypoxia and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Apelin has been shown to affect angiogenesis positively, considered the most critical component of the healing process. Although it is known that apelin and AJP expressions are induced by inflammatory stimuli and hypoxia, stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and have a role in regenerative angiogenesis, no information or has been found in the literature regarding the role of APJ in the formation and healing of gastric mucosal lesions induced by I/R. So, we conducted a study to clarify the role of APJ in formation and healing mechanisms of IR-induced gastric lesions. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups; control, sham-operated, IR, APJ antagonist treated-IR group (F13A+IR), and the healing groups. F13A was intravenously given to the animals. Gastric lesion index, mucosal blood flow, PGE2, NOx, 4-HNE-MDA, HO activity, and protein expressions of VEGF and HO-1 were measured. F13A application before the IR increased the mucosal injury, F13A application following the ischemia delayed the mucosal healing during the reperfusion period. Consequently, blocking apelin receptors may worsen gastric injury due to the IR and delay mucosal healing.\n",

      "Prenatal arsenic exposure is a major public health concern, associated with altered birth outcomes and increased respiratory disease risk. However, characterization of the long-term effects of mid-pregnancy (second trimester) arsenic exposure on multiple organ systems is scant. This study aimed to characterize the long-term impact of mid-pregnancy inorganic arsenic exposure on the lung, heart, and immune system, including infectious disease response using the C57BL/6 mouse model. Mice were exposed from gestational day 9 till birth to either 0 or 1000µg/L sodium (meta)arsenite in drinking water. Male and female offspring assessed at adulthood (10-12 weeks of age) did not show significant effects on recovery outcomes after ischemia reperfusion injury but did exhibit increased airway hyperresponsiveness compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis revealed significantly greater total numbers of cells in arsenic-exposed lungs, lower MHCII expression in natural killer cells, and increased percentages of dendritic cell populations. Activated interstitial (IMs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs) isolated from arsenic-exposed male mice produced significantly less IFN-γ than controls. Conversely, activated AMs from arsenic-exposed females produced significantly more IFN-γ than controls. Although systemic cytokine levels were higher upon Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in prenatally arsenic-exposed offspring there was no difference in lung Mtb burden compared to controls. This study highlights significant long-term impacts of prenatal arsenic exposure on lung and immune cell function. These effects may contribute to the elevated risk of respiratory diseases associated with prenatal arsenic exposure in epidemiology studies and point to the need for more research into mechanisms driving these maintained responses.\n",

      "Ischemia reperfusion injury is a common precipitant of acute kidney injury that occurs following disrupted perfusion to the kidney. This includes blood loss and hemodynamic shock, as well as during retrieval for deceased donor kidney transplantation. Acute kidney injury is associated with adverse long-term clinical outcomes and requires effective interventions that can modify the disease process. Immunomodulatory cell therapies such as tolerogenic dendritic cells remain a promising tool, and here we tested the hypothesis that adoptively transferred tolerogenic dendritic cells can limit kidney injury. The phenotypic and genomic signatures of bone marrow-derived syngeneic or allogeneic, Vitamin-D3/IL-10 conditioned tolerogenic dendritic cells were assessed. These cells were characterized by high PD-L1:CD86, elevated IL-10, restricted IL-12p70 secretion and a suppressed transcriptomic inflammatory profile. When infused systemically, these cells successfully abrogated kidney injury without modifying infiltrating inflammatory cell populations. They also provided protection against ischemia reperfusion injury in mice pre-treated with liposomal clodronate, suggesting the process was regulated by live, rather than reprocessed cells. Co-culture experiments and spatial transcriptomic analysis confirmed reduced kidney tubular epithelial cell injury. Thus, our data provide strong evidence that peri-operatively administered tolerogenic dendritic cells have the ability to protect against acute kidney injury and warrants further exploration as a therapeutic option. This technology may provide a clinical advantage for bench-to-bedside translation to affect patient outcomes.\n",

      "Fatty liver grafts are susceptible to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), increasing the risk of biliary complications after liver transplantation (LT). Ferroptosis, a newly recognized programmed cell death, is expected to be a novel therapeutic target for IRI. We investigated whether exosomes derived from heme oxygenase 1-modified bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HExos) relieve ferroptosis and protect biliary tracts from IRI in a rat fatty liver transplantation model. Rats were fed with a methionine choline deficient (MCD) diet for 2 weeks to induce severe hepatic steatosis. Steatotic grafts were implanted and HExos were administered after liver transplantation. A series of functional assays and pathological analysis were performed to assess ferroptosis and biliary IRI. The HExos attenuated IRI following liver transplantation, as demonstrated by less ferroptosis, improved liver function, less Kupffer and T cell activation, and less long-term biliary fibrosis. MicroRNA (miR)-204-5p delivered by HExos negatively regulated ferroptosis by targeting a key pro-ferroptosis enzyme, ACSL4. Ferroptosis contributes to biliary IRI in fatty liver transplantation. HExos protect steatotic grafts by inhibiting ferroptosis, and may become a promising strategy to prevent biliary IRI and expand the donor pool.\n",

Hepatic injury, inflammatory responses, innate immunity, KCs phenotypic polarization and mitochondrial dynamics were evaluated with or without KCs Drp-1 overexpression RESULTS: MSCs markedly ameliorated liver injury and attenuated inflammatory responses and innate immunity after liver IR injury. MSCs significantly restrained M1 phenotypic polarization but boosted M2 polarization of KCs extracted from ischemic liver, as demonstrated by lowered transcript levels of iNOS and IL-1β but raised transcript levels of Mrc-1 and Arg-1 combined with p-STAT6 up-regulation and p-STAT1 down-regulation. Moreover, MSCs inhibited KCs mitochondrial fission, as evidenced by decreased Drp1 and Dnm2 levels. We overexpressed Drp-1 in KCs which promote mitochondrial fission during IR injury. the regulation of MSCs towards KCs M1/M2 polarization was abrogated by Drp-1 overexpression after IR injury. Ultimately, in vivo Drp-1 overexpression in KCs hampered the therapeutic effects of MSCs against hepatic IR injury CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that MSCs facilitated M1-M2 phenotypic polarization through inhibiting Drp-1 dependent mitochondrial fission and further attenuated liver IR injury. These results add a new insight into regulating mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics during hepatic IR injury and may offer novel opportunities for developing therapeutic targets to combat hepatic IR injury.\n",

The review details various types of natural compounds such as gypenoside (GP), gypenoside XVII (GP-17), geniposide, berberine, dihydroquercetin (DHQ), and tilianin which identified to reduce MIRI in vitro and in vivo by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In this study, 14 research publications that met the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria were shortlisted. Following the intervention, we discovered that natural products effectively improved cardiac functions through regulation of antioxidant status, down-regulation of Bax, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 and caspases cleavage. Furthermore, although comparing outcomes can be challenging due to the heterogeneity in the study model, the results we assembled here were consistent, giving us confidence in the intervention's efficacy. We also discussed if MIRI is associated with multiple pathological condition such as oxidative stress, ERS, mitochondrial injury, inflammation, and apoptosis. This brief review provides evidence to support the huge potential of natural products used in the treatment of MIRI due to their various biological activities and drug-like properties.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) is related to ferroptosis and apoptosis elicited by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this research, we investigated the protective effect of salvianolic acid B (SAB) as a natural antioxidant on ferroptosis and apoptosis in the MIRI process, and discussed the protective mechanism inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) apoptosis signal pathway. We observed that ferroptosis and apoptosis occurred in the MIRI rat model in vivo and the H9c2 cardiomyocyte hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) damage model in vitro. SAB can alleviate tissue damage related to ROS, ferroptosis and apoptosis. Ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of GPX4 occurred in H/R models, and SAB reduced the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of GPX4. SAB downregulates JNK phosphorylation and the expression of BCL2-Associated X (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Caspase-3 to inhibit apoptosis. The role of GPX4 in the cardioprotection of SAB was further verified by the elimination effect of the GPX4 inhibitor RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3). This research shows that SAB may be used as a myocardial protective agent against oxidative stress, ferroptosis and apoptosis, and has potential clinical application prospects.\n",

We tested the effect of four different temperatures (4 °C-18 °C-25 °C-35 °C) on cardiac metabolism during 3-h ex vivo reperfusion in a porcine model of DCD heart. We observed a steep fall in high-energy phosphate (ATP) concentrations in the myocardial tissue at the end of the warm ischemic time and only limited regeneration during reperfusion. Lactate concentration in the perfusate increased rapidly during the first hour of reperfusion and slowly decreased afterward. However, the temperature of the solution does not seem to have an effect on either ATP or lactate concentration.

      "Robust activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling in diabetes exacerbates myocardial injury following lethal ischemia due to accelerated cardiomyocyte death with cardiac remodeling and inflammatory responses. We examined the effect of rapamycin (RAPA, mTOR inhibitor) on cardiac remodeling and inflammation following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in diabetic rabbits. Diabetic rabbits (DM) were subjected to 45 min of ischemia and 10 days of reperfusion by inflating/deflating a previously implanted hydraulic balloon occluder. RAPA (0.25 mg/kg, i.v.) or DMSO (vehicle) was infused 5 min before the onset of reperfusion. Post-I/R left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography and fibrosis was evaluated by picrosirius red staining. Treatment with RAPA preserved LV ejection fraction and reduced fibrosis. Immunoblot and real-time PCR revealed that RAPA treatment inhibited several fibrosis markers (TGF-β, Galectin-3, MYH, p-SMAD). Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed the attenuation of post-I/R NLRP3-inflammasome formation with RAPA treatment as shown by reduced aggregation of apoptosis speck-like protein with a caspase recruitment domain and active-form of caspase-1 in cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our study suggests that acute reperfusion therapy with RAPA may be a viable strategy to preserve cardiac function with the alleviation of adverse post-infarct myocardial remodeling and inflammation in diabetic patients.\n",

      "Renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), with high mortality. Recent studies have reported that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (HucMSCs) play an important role in repairing organ and tissue injuries because of their unique characteristics. However, the potential of HucMSC extracellular vesicles (HucMSC-EVs) to promote the repair of renal tubular cells remains to be explored. This study found that HucMSC-EVs derived from HucMSCs played a protective role and were associated with kidney I/R injury. We found that miR-148b-3p in HucMSC-EVs had a protective effect against kidney I/R injury. HK-2 cells overexpressing miR-148b-3p were protected against I/R injury by inhibiting apoptosis. Next, the target mRNA of miR-148b-3p was predicted online, and the target mRNA, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), was identified and verified using dual luciferase. We discovered that I/R injury significantly increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, whereas siR-PDK4 inhibited these effects and protected against I/R injury. Interestingly, after administrating HucMSC-EVs to HK-2 cells, PDK4 expression and ER stress induced by I/R injury were significantly inhibited. HK-2 ingested miR-148b-3p from HucMSC-EVs, and its ER induced by I/R injury was significantly deregulated. This study suggests that HucMSC-EVs protect kidneys from I/R injury during the early I/R stage. These results suggest a new mechanism for HucMSC-EVs in treating AKI and provide a new treatment strategy for I/R injury.\n",

Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of HC@HMC in middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R)-injured mice. In MCAO/R mice, oral administration of HC@HMC demonstrated significant protection against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Furthermore, we found HC@HMC may exert a protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through the COX2/PGD2/DPs pathway.

Despite substantial improvements of postoperative care, spinal cord injury (SCI) remains the most devastating complication of coEVAR being associated with impaired patient outcome and having an impact on long-term survival. The rising number of challenges of coEVAR, essentially associated with an extensive coverage of critical blood vessels supplying the spinal cord, resulted in the implementation of dedicated SCI prevention protocols. In addition to maintenance of adequate spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP), early detection of SCI plays an integral role in intra- and postoperative patient care. However, this is challenging due to difficulties with clinical neurological examinations during patient sedation in the postoperative setting. There is a rising amount of evidence, suggesting that subclinical forms of SCI might be accompanied by an elevation of biochemical markers, specific to neuronal tissue damage. Addressing this hypothesis, several studies have attempted to assess the potential of selected biomarkers with regard to early SCI diagnosis. In this review, we discuss biomarkers measured in patients undergoing coEVAR. Once validated in future prospective clinical studies, biomarkers of neuronal tissue damage may potentially add to the armamentarium of modalities for early SCI diagnosis and risk stratification.\n",

      "Aucubin is an iridoid glycoside that displays various pharmacological actions including antioxidant activity. However, there are few reports available on the neuroprotective effects of aucubin against ischemic brain injury. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether aucubin protected against damage to hippocampal function induced by forebrain ischemia-reperfusion injury (fIRI) in gerbils, and to examine whether aucubin produced neuroprotection in the hippocampus against fIRI and to explore its mechanisms by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and Western analysis. Gerbils were given intraperitoneal injections of aucubin at doses of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, respectively, once a day for seven days before fIRI. As assessed by the passive avoidance test, short-term memory function following fIRI significantly declined, whereas the decline in short-term memory function due to fIRI was ameliorated by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg, but not 1 or 5 mg/kg, of aucubin. Most of the pyramidal cells (principal cells) of the hippocampus died in the Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) area four days after fIRI. Treatment with 10 mg/kg, but not 1 or 5 mg/kg, of aucubin protected the pyramidal cells from IRI. The treatment with 10 mg/kg of aucubin significantly reduced IRI-induced superoxide anion production, oxidative DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation in the CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, the aucubin treatment significantly increased the expressions of superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2) in the pyramidal cells before and after fIRI. Furthermore, the aucubin treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression levels of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor-I, in the hippocampal CA1 area before and after IRI. Collectively, in this experiment, pretreatment with aucubin protected CA1 pyramidal cells from forebrain IRI by attenuating oxidative stress and increasing neurotrophic factors. Thus, pretreatment with aucubin can be a promising candidate for preventing brain IRI.\n",

The role of mitochondrial oxidative stress in bradyarrhythmia is less clear. Mice with a germline deletion of Ndufs4 subunit respiratory complex I develop severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy resembling Leigh Syndrome (LS). Several types of cardiac bradyarrhythmia are present in LS mice, including a frequent sinus node dysfunction and episodic atrioventricular (AV) block. Treatment with the mitochondrial antioxidant Mitotempo or mitochondrial protective peptide SS31 significantly ameliorated the bradyarrhythmia and extended the lifespan of LS mice. Using an ex vivo Langendorff perfused heart with live confocal imaging of mitochondrial and total cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), we showed increased ROS in the LS heart, which was potentiated by ischemia-reperfusion. A simultaneous ECG recording showed a sinus node dysfunction and AV block concurrent with the severity of the oxidative stress. Treatment with Mitotempo abolished ROS and restored the sinus rhythm. Our study reveals robust evidence of the direct mechanistic roles of mitochondrial and total ROS in bradyarrhythmia in the setting of LS mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Our study also supports the potential clinical application of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants or SS31 for the treatment of LS patients.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion causes exacerbated neuronal damage involving excessive neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. ROS is considered a signal molecule to activate NLRP3; thus, the ROS/NLRP3/pyroptosis axis plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). Therefore, targeting the inhibition of the ROS/NLRP3/pyroptosis axis may be a promising therapeutic tactic for CIRI. Epimedium (EP) contains many active ingredients (ICA, ICS II, and ICT), which have a wide range of pharmacological activities. However, whether EP can protect against CIRI remains unknown. Thus, in this study, we designed to investigate the effect and possible underlying mechanism of EP on CIRI. The results showed that treatment with EP dramatically mitigated brain damage in rats following CIRI, which was achieved by suppressing mitochondrial oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we identified the ROS/NLRP3/pyroptosis axis as a vital process and NLRP3 as a vital target in EP-mediated protection. Most interestingly, the main compounds of EP directly bonded with NLRP3, as reflected by molecular docking, which indicated that NLRP3 might be a promising therapeutic target for EP-elicited cerebral protection. In conclusion, our findings illustrate that ICS II protects against neuron loss and neuroinflammation after CIRI by inhibiting ROS/NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.\n",

      "Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and usually brings severe public health consequences. Adipose-derived endothelial progenitor cell (AdEPCs) transplantation is beneficial for AKI but suffers from low delivery efficiency. This study was conducted to explore the protective effects of magnetically delivered AdEPCs on the repair of renal IRI. Two types of magnetic delivery methods, namely the endocytosis magnetization (EM) method and the immunomagnetic (IM) method were fabricated using PEG@Fe3O4 and CD133@Fe3O4, and their cytotoxicities in AdEPCs were assessed. In the renal IRI rat model, magnetic AdEPCs were injected via the tail vein and a magnet was placed beside the injured kidney for magnetic guidance. The distribution of transplanted AdEPCs, renal function, and tubular damage were evaluated. Our results suggested that CD133@Fe3O4 had the minimum negative effects on the proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and migration of AdEPCs compared with PEG@Fe3O4. Renal magnetic guidance could significantly enhance the transplantation efficiency and the therapeutic outcomes of AdEPCs-PEG@Fe3O4 and AdEPCs-CD133@Fe3O4 in the injured kidneys. However, under renal magnetic guidance, AdEPCs-CD133@Fe3O4 had stronger therapeutic effects than PEG@Fe3O4 after renal IRI. The immunomagnetic delivery of AdEPCs with CD133@Fe3O4 could be a promising therapeutic strategy for renal IRI.\n",

      "The aim of this study was to characterize expression of corticogenesis-related transcription factors BCL11B and SATB2 after brain ischemic lesion in the adult mice, and to analyze their correlation to the subsequent brain recovery. Ischemic brain lesion was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion, and the animals with ischemic lesion were compared to the sham controls. Progression of the brain damage and subsequent recovery was longitudinally monitored structurally, by magnetic resonance imaging, and functionally, by neurological deficit assessment. Seven days after the ischemic injury the brains were isolated and analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The results showed higher expression in the brain of both, BCL11B and SATB2 in the animals with ischemic lesion compared to the sham controls. The co-expression of both markers, BCL11B and SATB2, increased in the ischemic brains, as well as the co-expression of BCL11B with the beneficial transcriptional factor ATF3 but not its co-expression with detrimental HDAC2. BCL11B was mainly implicated in the ipsilateral and SATB2 in the contralateral brain hemisphere, and their level in these regions correlated with the functional recovery rate. The results indicate that the reactivation of corticogenesis-related transcription factors BCL11B and SATB2 is beneficial after brain ischemic lesion.\n",

      "Mitochondrial function is critical to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardioprotection. The measurement of mitochondrial function in isolated mitochondria requires cardiac specimens of about 300 mg and is therefore only possible at the end of an animal experiment or during cardiosurgical interventions in humans. As an alternative, mitochondrial function can be measured in permeabilized myocardial tissue (PMT) specimens of about 2-5 mg, which are retrieved by sequential biopsies in animal experiments and during cardiac catheterization in humans. We attempted to validate measurements of mitochondrial respiration from PMT by comparison to those from isolated mitochondria of left ventricular myocardium from anesthetized pigs undergoing 60 min coronary occlusion and 180 min reperfusion. Mitochondrial respiration was normalized to the content of mitochondrial marker proteins (cytochrome c oxidase 4 (COX4), citrate synthase and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase). When normalized to COX4, mitochondrial respiration measurements in PMT and isolated mitochondria agreed well in Bland-Altman plots (bias score: -0.03 nmol/min/COX4; 95% confidence interval: 6.31 nmol/min/COX4 and -6.37 nmol/min/COX4) and correlated well (slope of 0.77 and Pearson R of 0.87). Mitochondrial dysfunction by ischemia/reperfusion was equally reflected in PMT and isolated mitochondria (44% and 48% reduction of ADP-stimulated complex I respiration). Also in isolated human right atrial trabeculae, simulation of ischemia/reperfusion injury by exposure to 60 min hypoxia and 10 min reoxygenation reduced mitochondrial ADP-stimulated complex I respiration by 37% in PMT. In conclusion, mitochondrial function measurements in permeabilized cardiac tissue can substitute for that in isolated mitochondria to reflect mitochondrial dysfunction following ischemia/reperfusion.\n",

      "Prenatal hypoxia is associated with an enhanced susceptibility to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in adult offspring, however the mechanisms remain to be fully investigated. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor that acts via endothelin A (ETA) and endothelin B (ETB) receptors and is essential in maintaining cardiovascular (CV) function. Prenatal hypoxia alters the ET-1 system in adult offspring possibly contributing to I/R susceptibility. We previously showed that ex vivo application of ETA antagonist ABT-627 during I/R prevented the recovery of cardiac function in prenatal hypoxia-exposed males but not in normoxic males nor normoxic or prenatal hypoxia-exposed females. In this follow-up study we examined whether placenta-targeted treatment with a nanoparticle encapsulated mitochondrial antioxidant (nMitoQ) during hypoxic pregnancies could alleviate this hypoxic phenotype observed in adult male offspring. We used a rat model of prenatal hypoxia where pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hypoxia (11% O2) from gestational days (GD) 15-21 after injection with 100μL saline or nMitoQ (125 μM) on GD 15. Male offspring were aged to 4 months and ex vivo cardiac recovery from I/R was assessed. Offspring born from hypoxic pregnancies treated with nMitoQ had increased cardiac recovery from I/R in the presence of ABT-627 compared to their untreated counterparts where ABT-627 prevented recovery. Cardiac ETA levels were increased in males born from hypoxic pregnancies with nMitoQ treatment compared to saline controls (Western blotting). Our data indicate a profound impact of placenta-targeted treatment to prevent an ETA receptor cardiac phenotype observed in adult male offspring exposed to hypoxia in utero.\n",

      "Cardiovascular disease is thought to account for nearly a third of deaths worldwide, with ischemic heart disease, including acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction, accounting for 1.7 million deaths per year. There is a clear need for interventions to impart cardioprotection against ischemia. Here, we show that the slowly activating voltage-gated potassium current (IKs) potentiator ML277 imparts cardioprotection against ischemia in cellular and whole-heart models by modulating the action potential duration. In three different metabolic inhibition and reperfusion models, an increased contractile recovery and cell survival was observed with ML277, indicative of protection. Finally, ML277 reduced infarct size in an ex vivo Langendorff coronary ligation model, including if only applied on reperfusion. In conclusion, potentiation of the IKs with ML277 imparted a cardioprotection that was equivalent to the protection reported previously by ischemic preconditioning. These data suggest that IKs potentiation may be therapeutically useful in acute coronary syndromes.\n",

Damage to the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the pathological basis of HT. Here, we investigated the molecular events of BBB damage after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) using in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and in vivo mice middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) models. Our results showed that the permeability of bEND.3 monolayer endothelial cells was significantly increased after being exposed to OGD for 2 h. Mice were subjected to 90-min ischemia with 45-min reperfusion, and BBB integrity was significantly damaged, accompanied by tight junction protein occludin degradation, downregulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), phosphorylated Smad (p-Smad), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and the upregulation of PDZ and LIM domain protein 5 (Pdlim5), an adaptor protein that has been shown to regulate TGF-β-Smad3 pathway. In addition, pretreatment with two-week nicotine significantly reduced AIS-induced BBB damage and its associated protein dysregulation via downregulating Pdlim5. Notably, AIS did not significantly induce BBB damage in Pdlim5 deficit mice, but overexpression of Pdlim5 in the striatum with adeno-associated virus produced BBB damage and associated protein dysregulation which could be ameliorated by two-week nicotine pretreatment. More important, AIS induced a significant miR-21 decrease, and miR-21 mimics treatment decreased AIS-induced BBB damage by decreasing Pdlim5. Together, these results demonstrate that nicotine treatment alleviates the AIS-compromised integrity of BBB by regulating Pdlim5.\n",

This pathway is crucial for the induction of cardioprotection by numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, such as ischaemic conditioning. An important component of the cardioprotective effects of the RISK pathway involves the prevention of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening and subsequent cardiac cell death.

      "The calcium (Ca2+) permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) cation channel is expressed in neutrophils and contributes to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Here we tested the hypotheses that TRPV4 promotes neutrophil activation and subsequently aggregates myocardial I/R injury. TRPV4 protein was confirmed in neutrophils and its function was assessed by the current and intracellular Ca2+ concentration elevations evoked by TRPV4 agonists. Furthermore, TRPV4 agonists dose-repandly promoted migration toward fMLP, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) release, which were prevented by pretreatment with a selective TRPV4 antagonist, in neutrophils from TRPV4 knock-out (KO) mice, Ca2+-free medium, or BAPTA-AM + Ca2+-free medium. Blockade of TRPV4 also inhibited the effects of commonly used neutrophil activators N-formyl-l-methionyl-leucyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLP) and Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Mechanically, TRPV4 regulated neutrophil activation, particularly ROS production, by affecting PKCα, P38, and AKT via Ca2+ signaling. In addition, isolated hearts infused with neutrophils from wild-type (WT) mice showed additional myocardial I/R injuries, but not those infused with TRPV4 KO. Our study reveals that TRPV4-mediated neutrophil activation enhances myocardial I/R injury, and it might be a novel therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and other neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases.\n",

      "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC)-derived exosomes are a promising therapeutic agent for human disease, but their effects on neural stem cells (NSCs) subject to spinal cord ischaemia-reperfusion injury (SCIRI) remain unknown. Here, we examine the impact of miR-199a-5p-enriched exosomes derived from BMSCs on NSC proliferation. We establish a rat model of aortic cross-clamping to induce SCIRI in vivo and a primary NSC model of oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to simulate SCIRI in vitro. CCK8, EdU, and BrdU assays are performed to evaluate the proliferation of NSCs. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is used to determine the number of surviving neurons. The Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and inclined plane test (IPT) are used to evaluate hind limb motor function. DiO-labelled exosomes are efficiently internalized by NSCs and increase ectopic amounts of miR-199a-5p, which promotes the proliferation of NSCs. In contrast, exosomes derived from miR-199a-5p-depleted BMSCs exert fewer beneficial effects. MiR-199a-5p targets and negatively regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and increases nuclear β-catenin and cyclin D1 levels. miR-199a-5p inhibition reduces the total number of EdU-positive NSCs after OGD/R, but the GSK-3β inhibitor CHIR-99021 reverses this effect. In vivo, intrathecal injection of BMSC-derived exosomes increases the proliferation of endogenous spinal cord NSCs after SCIRI. In addition, more proliferating NSCs are found in rats intrathecally injected with exosomes overexpressing miR-199a-5p. In summary, miR-199a-5p in BMSC-derived exosomes promotes NSC proliferation via GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling.\n",

Liver-specific knockdown of YAP inhibited hepatocytes autophagy upon hypoxia-reoxygenation and HIRI (P <0.05). YAP deficiency aggravated HIRI by promoting the apoptosis of hepatocytes both in the in vitro and in vivo models (P <0.05). Attenuated HIRI by overexpression of YAP was diminished after the inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine. In addition, inhibiting autophagy activation by YAP knockdown exacerbated mitochondrial damage through increasing reactive oxygen species (P <0.05). Moreover, the regulation of autophagy by YAP during HIRI was mediated by AP1 (c-Jun) N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling through binding to the transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD).\n",

      "It has been reported that ginsenoside Rg1 (G‑Rg1) can alleviate alcoholic liver injury, cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial ischemia, as well as reperfusion injury. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the role of G‑Rg1 in alcohol‑induced myocardial injury, as well as to elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. For this purpose, H9c2 cells were stimulated with ethanol. Subsequently, H9c2 cell viability and apoptosis were determined using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. The levels of lactate dehydrogenase and caspase‑3 in the H9c2 cell culture supernatant were detected using corresponding assay kits. In addition, the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)‑light chain 3 (LC3) and that of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were evaluated using GFP‑LC3 assay and immunofluorescence staining, respectively. The expression levels of apoptosis‑, autophagy‑, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)‑ and adenosine 5'‑monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway‑related proteins were detected using western blot analysis. The results revealed that treatment with G‑Rg1 enhanced the viability and suppressed the apoptosis of ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells. G‑Rg1 also attenuated autophagy and ERS in ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells. In addition, the levels of phosphorylated (p)‑protein kinase R (PKR)‑like ER kinase (PERK), p‑eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CHOP, caspase‑12 and p‑AMPK were downregulated, while the p‑mTOR level was upregulated in ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells treated with G‑Rg1. Furthermore, the co‑treatment of G‑Rg1‑treated ethanol‑stimulated H9c2 cells with AICAR, an AMPK agonist, or CCT020312, a PERK agonist, inhibited cell viability and promoted cell apoptosis, autophagy and ERS. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that G‑Rg1 suppresses autophagy and ERS via inhibiting the AMPK/mTOR and PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathways to alleviate ethanol‑induced H9c2 cell injury.\n",

As we have previously revealed a deleterious stress-related role for leptin expression, these results suggested that leptin is also involved in pathological renal remodeling.

In this review we highlight the burden of disease associated with AMI and the therapeutic landscape based on market analyses. New studies revealing the role of acid-sensitive cardiac ion channels and other proton-gated ion channels in cardiac ischaemia are providing renewed interest in pre- and post-conditioning agents with novel mechanisms of action that may also have implications for gene- and cell-based therapeutics. Furthermore, we present guidelines that couple new cell technologies and data resources with traditional animal modelling pipelines to help de-risk drug candidates aimed at treating AMI.

IRI is the major pathophysiologic mechanism of primary graft dysfunction, a severe complication that contributes to prolonged length of stay and overall mortality. The understanding of pathophysiology and etiology remain limited and the underlying molecular mechanism, as well as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, urgently require exploration. Excessive uncontrolled inflammatory response is the core mechanism of IRI. In this research, a weighted gene co-expression network was established using the CIBERSORT and WGCNA algorithms in order to identify macrophage-related hub genes based on the data downloaded from the GEO database (GSE127003, GSE18995). 692 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in reperfused lung allografts were identified, with three genes recognized as being related to M1 macrophages and validated as differentially expressed using GSE18995 dataset. Of these putative novel biomarker genes, TCRα subunit constant gene (TRAC) were downregulated, while Perforin-1 (PRF1) and Granzyme B (GZMB) were upregulated in reperfused vs. ischemic lung allografts. Furthermore, we obtained 189 potentially therapeutic small molecules for IRI after lung transplantation from the CMap database among which PD-98059 was the top molecule with the highest absolute correlated connectivity score (CS). Our study provides the novel insights into the impact of immune cells on the etiology of IRI and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

      "Transport of Ca2+ into mitochondria is thought to stimulate the production of ATP, a critical process in the heart's fight or flight response, but excess Ca2+ can trigger cell death. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complex is the primary route of Ca2+ transport into mitochondria, in which the channel-forming protein MCU and the regulatory protein EMRE are essential for activity. In previous studies, chronic Mcu or Emre deletion differ from acute cardiac Mcu deletion in response to adrenergic stimulation and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, despite equivalent inactivation of rapid mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. To explore this discrepancy between chronic and acute loss of uniporter activity, we compared short-term and long-term Emre deletion using a novel conditional cardiac-specific, tamoxifen-inducible mouse model. After short-term Emre deletion (3 weeks post-tamoxifen) in adult mice, cardiac mitochondria were unable to take up Ca2+, had lower basal mitochondrial Ca2+ levels, and displayed attenuated Ca2+-induced ATP production and mPTP opening. Moreover, short-term EMRE loss blunted cardiac response to adrenergic stimulation and improved maintenance of cardiac function in an ex vivo I/R model. We then tested whether the long-term absence of EMRE (3 months post-tamoxifen) in adulthood would lead to distinct outcomes. After long-term Emre deletion, mitochondrial Ca2+ handling and function, as well as cardiac response to adrenergic stimulation, were similarly impaired as in short-term deletion. Interestingly, however, protection from I/R injury was lost in the long-term. These data suggest that several months without uniporter function are insufficient to restore bioenergetic response but are sufficient to restore susceptibility to I/R.\n",

Nogo-B down-regulation could markedly reduce the neurological score and infarct volume, improve the histopathological changes and neuronal apoptosis, lower the number of CD86+/Iba1+ cells and the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and raise the density of NeuN fluorescence, the number of CD206+/Iba1+ cells, and the level of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β in brain of MCAO/R mice. Treatment with Nogo-B siRNA or TAK-242 in BV-2 cells could obviously decrease the CD86 fluorescence density and the mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, increase CD206 fluorescence density and the mRNA expression of IL-10 after OGD/R injury. In addition, the expression of TLR4, p-IκBα and p-p65 proteins significantly increased in the brain after MCAO/R and BV-2 cells exposed to OGD/R. Treatment with Nogo-B siRNA or TAK-242 prominently reduced the expression of TLR4, p-IκBα and p-p65. Our findings suggest that the down-regulation of Nogo-B exerts protective effect on cerebral I/R injury by modulating the microglia polarization through inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Nogo-B may be a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.\n",

      "Myocardial tissue cell damage induced by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) notably elevates the mortality rate, increases the complications of patients with myocardial infarction and decreases reperfusion benefit in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction. Roflumilast protect against cardiotoxicity. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of roflumilast on MI/R injury and the underlying mechanisms. To simulate MI/R in vivo and in vitro, the rat model of MI/R was established and H9C2 cells were subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induction, respectively. The myocardial infarction areas were observed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The myocardial enzyme levels in serum and levels of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers in cardiac tissue were assessed by corresponding assay kits. The cardiac damage was observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential in cardiac tissue and H9C2 cells was detected using the JC-1 staining kit. The viability and apoptosis of H9C2 cells were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 and TUNEL assay, respectively. The levels of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress markers and ATP in H/R-induced H9C2 cells were analyzed by corresponding assay kits. Western blotting was used for the estimation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway-, apoptosis- and mitochondrial regulation-associated protein levels. The mPTP opening was detected using a calcein-loading/cobalt chloride-quenching system. The results indicated that roflumilast decreased MI/R-induced myocardial infarction by alleviating myocardial injury and mitochondrial damage through the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. In addition, roflumilast mitigated viability damage, alleviated oxidative stress, attenuated the inflammatory response and decreased mitochondrial damage in H/R-induced H9C2 cells by activating the AMPK signaling pathway. However, compound C, an inhibitor of the AMPK signaling pathway, reversed the effect of roflumilast on H/R-induced H9C2 cells. In conclusion, roflumilast alleviated myocardial infarction in MI/R rats and attenuated H/R-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory response and mitochondrial damage in H9C2 cells by activating the AMPK signaling pathway.\n",

      "Aim: The Shexiang Baoxin Pill (SBP) has been extensively used to treat cardiovascular diseases in China for four decades, and its clinical efficacy has been widely approved. However, the mechanism by which this is achieved remains largely unexplored. Research attempting to understand the underlying mechanism is ongoing, but the findings are controversial. Here, we aimed to explore the possible mechanism of SBP in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury using heart single-nucleus and spatial ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing. Methods: We established a murine myocardial I/R injury model in C57BL/6 mice by ligating and recanalizing the left coronary artery anterior descending branch. Subsequently, single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics were performed on mice cardiac tissue. We initially assessed the status of cell types and subsets in the model administered with or without SBP. Results: We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively analyze cell types in the cardiac tissue of sham, I/R, and SBP mice. Nine samples from nine individuals were analyzed, and 75,546 cells were obtained. We classified the cells into 28 clusters based on their expression characteristics and annotated them into seven cell types: cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, smooth muscle cells, B cells, and T cells. The SBP group had distinct cellular compositions and features than the I/R group. Furthermore, SBP-induced cardioprotection against I/R was associated with enhanced cardiac contractility, reduced endocardial cell injury, increased endocardial-mediated angiogenesis, and inhibited fibroblast proliferation. In addition, macrophages had active properties. Conclusion: SBP improves the early LVEF of I/R mice and has a cardioprotective effect. Through sequencing analysis, we observed that SBP can increase the gene expression of Nppb and Npr3 in the infarct area of the heart. Npr3 is related to vascular generation mediated by endocardial cells and requires further research. In addition, SBP increases the number of fibroblasts, inhibits the expression of genes related to fibroblast activation and proliferation, and increases the transformation of endothelial cells into fibroblasts. These findings will help to indicate directions for further research.\n",

      "Gut microbiota affects the gut-brain axis; hence, the modulation of the microbiota has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, the role and mechanism of the gut microbiota in regulating microglial polarization during CIRI remain poorly understood. Herein, using a middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model, we evaluated changes in the gut microbiota after CIRI and the potential effects of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) on the brain. Rats underwent either MCAO/R or sham surgery, and then they received FMT (started 3 days later; continued for 10 days). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, neurological outcome scale, and Fluoro-Jade C staining showed that MCAO/R induced cerebral infarction, neurological deficits, and neuronal degeneration. In addition, immunohistochemistry or real-time PCR assay showed increased expression levels of M1-macrophage markers-TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS-in the rats following MCAO/R. Our finding suggests that microglial M1 polarization is involved in CIRI. 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data revealed an imbalance in the gut microbiota of MCAO/R animals. In contrast, FMT reversed this MCAO/R-induced imbalance in the gut microbiota and ameliorated nerve injury. In addition, FMT prevented the upregulation in the ERK and NF-κB pathways, which reversed the M2-to-M1 microglial shift 10 days after MCAO/R injury in rats. Our primary data showed that the modulation of the gut microbiota can attenuate CIRI in rats by inhibiting microglial M1 polarization through the ERK and NF-κB pathways. However, an understanding of the underlying mechanism requires further study.\n",

      "Over the past thirty years, the complexity of the αβ-T cell compartment has been enriched by the identification of innate-like T cells (ITCs), which are composed mainly of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Based on animal studies using ischemia-reperfusion (IR) models, a key role has been attributed to iNKT cells in close connection with the alarmin/cytokine interleukin (IL)-33, as early sensors of cell-stress in the initiation of acute sterile inflammation. Here we have investigated whether the new concept of a biological axis of circulating iNKT cells and IL-33 applies to humans, and may be extended to other ITC subsets, namely MAIT and γδ-T cells, in the acute sterile inflammation sequence occurring during liver transplant (LT). From a prospective biological collection of recipients, we reported that LT was accompanied by an early and preferential activation of iNKT cells, as attested by almost 40% of cells having acquired the expression of CD69 at the end of LT (i.e. 1-3 hours after portal reperfusion), as opposed to only 3-4% of conventional T cells. Early activation of iNKT cells was positively correlated with the systemic release of the alarmin IL-33 at graft reperfusion. Moreover, in a mouse model of hepatic IR, iNKT cells were activated in the periphery (spleen), and recruited in the liver in WT mice, as early as the first hour after reperfusion, whereas this phenomenon was virtually missing in IL-33-deficient mice. Although to a lesser degree than iNKT cells, MAIT and γδ-T cells also seemed targeted during LT, as attested by 30% and 10% of them acquiring CD69 expression, respectively. Like iNKT cells, and in clear contrast to γδ-T cells, activation of MAIT cells during LT was closely associated with both release of IL-33 immediately after graft reperfusion and severity of liver dysfunction occurring during the first three post-operative days. All in all, this study identifies iNKT and MAIT cells in connection with IL-33 as new key cellular factors and mechanisms of acute sterile inflammation in humans. Further investigations are required to confirm the implication of MAIT and iNKT cell subsets, and to precisely assess their functions, in the clinical course of sterile inflammation accompanying LT.\n",

      "Sympathetic nerve loss in the heart predicts the risk of ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients. Sympathetic denervation after cardiac ischemia-reperfusion is sustained by matrix components chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the cardiac scar. We showed that 4,6-sulfation of CSPGs was critical for preventing nerve growth into the scar. Promoting early reinnervation with therapeutics reduces arrhythmias during the first 2 weeks after MI, but the longer-term consequences of restoring innervation are unknown. Therefore, we asked if the beneficial effects of early reinnervation were sustained. We compared cardiac function and arrhythmia susceptibility 40 days after MI in mice treated on Days 3-10 with vehicle or with intracellular sigma peptide to restore innervation. Surprisingly, both groups had normal innervation density in the cardiac scar 40 days after MI, indicating delayed reinnervation of the infarct in vehicle-treated mice. That coincided with similar cardiac function and arrhythmia susceptibility in the two groups. We investigated the mechanism allowing delayed reinnervation of the cardiac scar. We found that CSPG 4,6-sulfation, which is elevated early after ischemia-reperfusion, was reduced to control levels allowing reinnervation of the infarct. Thus, remodeling of extracellular matrix weeks after injury leads to remodeling of sympathetic neurons in the heart.\n",

      "Harnessing the potential beneficial effects of kinase signalling through the generation of direct kinase activators remains an underexplored area of drug development1-5. This also applies to the PI3K signalling pathway, which has been extensively targeted by inhibitors for conditions with PI3K overactivation, such as cancer and immune dysregulation. Here we report the discovery of UCL-TRO-1938 (referred to as 1938 hereon), a small-molecule activator of the PI3Kα isoform, a crucial effector of growth factor signalling. 1938 allosterically activates PI3Kα through a distinct mechanism by enhancing multiple steps of the PI3Kα catalytic cycle and causes both local and global conformational changes in the PI3Kα structure. This compound is selective for PI3Kα over other PI3K isoforms and multiple protein and lipid kinases. It transiently activates PI3K signalling in all rodent and human cells tested, resulting in cellular responses such as proliferation and neurite outgrowth. In rodent models, acute treatment with 1938 provides cardioprotection from ischaemia-reperfusion injury and, after local administration, enhances nerve regeneration following nerve crush. This study identifies a chemical tool to directly probe the PI3Kα signalling pathway and a new approach to modulate PI3K activity, widening the therapeutic potential of targeting these enzymes through short-term activation for tissue protection and regeneration. Our findings illustrate the potential of activating kinases for therapeutic benefit, a currently largely untapped area of drug development.\n",

Although the roles of HIF-1α NTAD in kidney diseases have been recognized, the exact effects of HIF-1α CTAD in kidney diseases are poorly understood. Here, two independent mouse models of hypoxia-induced kidney injury were established using HIF-1α CTAD knockout (HIF-1α CTAD-/-) mice. Furthermore, hexokinase 2 (HK2) and mitophagy pathway are modulated using genetic and pharmacological methods, respectively. We demonstrated that HIF-1α CTAD-/- aggravated kidney injury in two independent mouse models of hypoxia-induced kidney injury, including ischemia/reperfusion-induced kidney injury and unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced nephropathy. Mechanistically, we found that HIF-1α CTAD could transcriptionally regulate HK2 and subsequently ameliorate hypoxia-induced tubule injury. Furthermore, it was found that HK2 deficiency contributed to severe renal injury through mitophagy inhibition, while mitophagy activation using urolithin A could significantly protect against hypoxia-induced kidney injury in HIF-1α C-TAD-/- mice. Our findings suggested that the HIF-1α CTAD-HK2 pathway represents a novel mechanism of kidney response to hypoxia, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for hypoxia-induced kidney injury.\n",

      "Random skin flaps have limited clinical application as a broad surgical reconstruction treatment because of distal necrosis. The prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein inhibitor roxadustat (RXD) enhances angiogenesis and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation. This study explored the function of RXD in the survival of random skin flaps. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into low-dose RXD group (L-RXD group, 10 mg/kg/2 day), high-dose RXD group (H-RXD group, 25 mg/kg/2 day), and control group (1 mL of solvent, 1:9 DMSO:corn oil). The proportion of surviving flaps was determined on day 7 after surgery. Angiogenesis was assessed by lead oxide/gelatin angiography, and microcirculation blood perfusion was evaluated by laser Doppler flow imaging. Specimens in zone II were obtained, and the contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured as indicators of oxidative stress. Histopathological status was evaluated with haematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the inflammatory factors interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected by immunohistochemistry. RXD promoted flap survival and microcirculatory blood perfusion. Angiogenesis was detected distinctly in the experimental group. SOD activity increased and the MDA level decreased in the experimental group. Immunohistochemistry indicated that the expression levels of HIF-1α and VEGF were increased while the levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were decreased after RXD injection. RXD promoted random flap survival by reinforcing vascular hyperplasia and decreasing inflammation and ischaemia-reperfusion injury.\n",

      "During cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, excess reactive oxygen species can damage mitochondrial, cellular and organ function. Here we show that cysteine oxidation of the mitochondrial protein Opa1 contributes to mitochondrial damage and cell death caused by oxidative stress. Oxy-proteomics of ischemic-reperfused hearts reveal oxidation of the C-terminal C786 of Opa1 and treatment of perfused mouse hearts, adult cardiomyocytes, and fibroblasts with H2O2 leads to the formation of a reduction-sensitive ∼180 KDa Opa1 complex, distinct from the ∼270 KDa one antagonizing cristae remodeling. This Opa1 oxidation process is curtailed by mutation of C786 and of the other 3 Cys residues of its C-terminal domain (Opa1TetraCys). When reintroduced in Opa1-/- cells, Opa1TetraCys is not efficiently processed into short Opa1TetraCys and hence fails to fuse mitochondria. Unexpectedly, Opa1TetraCys restores mitochondrial ultrastructure in Opa1-/- cells and protects them from H2O2-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cristae remodeling, cytochrome c release and cell death. Thus, preventing the Opa1 oxidation occurring during cardiac ischemia-reperfusion reduces mitochondrial damage and cell death induced by oxidative stress independent of mitochondrial fusion.\n",

      "Obestatin is a gut hormone composed of 23 amino acids that play a role in protecting the heart. It is synthesized from the same preproghrelin gut hormone gene as another gut hormone. The function and receptor of obestatin remain controversial, despite being present in various organs such as the liver, heart, mammary gland, pancreas, and more. The activity of obestatin is opposite to that of ghrelin, another hormone. The GPR-39 receptor is used by obestatin to exert its effects. Obestatin's cardioprotective role can be attributed to its ability to affect various factors, including adipose tissue, blood pressure regulation, heart, ischemia-reperfusion injury, endothelial cells, and diabetes. Because these factors are related to the cardiovascular system, modifying them via obestatin can provide cardioprotection. Furthermore, ghrelin, its antagonist hormone, regulates cardiovascular health. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemia-reperfusion injury can all alter ghrelin/obestatin levels. Obestatin has also been shown to impact other organs, reducing weight and appetite, inhibiting food intake, and increasing adipogenesis. Obestatin has a brief half-life and is quickly degraded by proteases in the blood, liver, and kidneys after entering circulation. This article offers insights into the cardiac function of obestatin.\n",

      "We aimed to investigate the probable protective effects of gallic acid (GA) on cognitive deficits, hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) impairments, and molecular changes induced by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats following exposure to ambient dust storm. After pretreatment with GA (100 mg/kg), or vehicle (Veh) (normal saline, 2 ml/kg) for ten days, and 60 minutes' exposure to dust storm including PM (PM, 2000-8000 g/m3) every day, 4-vessel occlusion (4VO) type of I/R was induced. Three days after I/R induction, we evaluated behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, molecular and brain tissue inflammatory cytokine changes. Our findings indicated that pretreatment with GA significantly reduced cognitive impairments caused by I/R (P < 0.05) and hippocampal LTP impairments caused by I/R after PM exposure (P < 0.001). Additionally, after exposure to PM, I/R significantly elevated the tumor necrosis factor α content (P < 0.01) and miR-124 level (P < 0.001) while pre-treatment with GA reduced the level of miR-124 (P < 0.001). Histopathological results also revealed that I/R and PM caused cell death in the hippocampus CA1 area (P < 0.001) and that GA decreased the rate of cell death (P < 0.001). Our findings show that GA can prevent brain inflammation, and thus cognitive and LTP deficits caused by I/R, PM exposure, or both.\n",

Due to limited transcriptomic and methylomic information for facultative hibernators, we here conducted RNA and whole-genome bisulfide sequencing in liver of hibernating Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Gene ontology analysis was performed on 844 differentially expressed genes and confirmed the shift in metabolic fuel utilization, inhibition of RNA transcription and cell cycle regulation as found in seasonal hibernators. Additionally, we showed a so far unreported suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein phosphatase 1 pathways during torpor. Notably, hibernating hamsters showed upregulation of MAPK inhibitors (dual-specificity phosphatases and sproutys) and reduced levels of MAPK-induced transcription factors (TFs). Promoter methylation was found to modulate the expression of genes targeted by these TFs. In conclusion, we document gene regulation between hibernation phases, which may aid the identification of pathways and targets to prevent organ damage in transplantation or ischaemia-reperfusion.\n",

      "Emerging evidence indicates that the use of low-load resistance training in combination with blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) can be an effective method to elicit increases in muscle size, with most research showing similar whole muscle development of the extremities compared to high-load (HL) training. It is conceivable that properties unique to LL-BFR such as greater ischemia, reperfusion, and metabolite accumulation may enhance the stress on type I fibers during training compared to the use of LLs without occlusion. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper was to systematically review the relevant literature on the fiber-type-specific response to LL-BFR and provide insights into future directions for research. A total of 11 studies met inclusion criteria. Results of the review suggest that the magnitude of type I fiber hypertrophy is at least as great, and sometimes greater, than type II hypertrophy when performing LL-BFR. This finding is in contrast to HL training, where the magnitude of type II fiber hypertrophy tends to be substantially greater than that of type I myofibers. However, limited data directly compare training with LL-BFR to nonoccluded LL or HL conditions, thus precluding the ability to draw strong inferences as to whether the absolute magnitude of type I hypertrophy is indeed greater in LL-BFR vs. traditional HL training. Moreover, it remains unclear as to whether combining LL-BFR with traditional HL training may enhance whole muscle hypertrophy via greater increases in type I myofiber cross-sectional area.\n",

The purpose of this study was to explore the role and effect of phloretin, a TLR4 inhibitor, as an adjuvant therapy to empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) under diabetic conditions. To achieve this, firstly we induced type 1 diabetes using streptozotocin (55 mg per kg per intraperitoneally (i.p.)) followed by performing bilateral ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury to induce AKI in male Wistar rats. Treatment with phloretin (50 and 100 mg per kg per orally) and empagliflozin (10 mgper kg per orally) alone or in combination was administered to the diabetic rats for 4 days and 1 h before surgery. Moreover, a hypoxia-reperfusion injury was induced using sodium azide in NRK52E cells under a hyperglycemic environment to mimic the in vivo model. The cells were treated with phloretin (50 μM) and empagliflozin (100 nM) for 24 h. For biochemical analysis, plasma and urine samples were used. The kidney tissues were used to perform immunoblotting, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Other experiments like immunofluorescence, cell viability assay, and flow cytometry analysis were performed using the in vitro samples. The study outcomes revealed that compared to monotherapy, combination therapy of phloretin and empagliflozin was significantly effective. Phloretin and empagliflozin target the HMGB1/TLR4/MyD88/IK-β/α/NF-κB pathway to reduce inflammation and apoptosis, in addition to their antihyperglycemic effect. Thus, phloretin, a natural dietary supplement, as an adjuvant therapy to empagliflozin can be helpful to reduce empagliflozin-associated side effects, by reducing its clinical dose and increasing its therapeutic efficacy in AKI-diabetes comorbidity.\n",

      "The use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with mortality rate of 5-7%. It is clear that there is an urgent need to develop new drugs that can effectively prevent cardiac reperfusion injury. ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP ) channel openers (KCOs) can be classified as such drugs. KCOs prevent irreversible ischemia and reperfusion injury of the heart. KATP channel opening promotes inhibition of apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and stimulation of autophagy. KCOs prevent the development of cardiac adverse remodeling and improve cardiac contractility during reperfusion. KCOs exhibit antiarrhythmic properties and prevent the appearance of the no-reflow phenomenon in animals with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Diabetes mellitus and a cholesterol-enriched diet abolish the cardioprotective effect of KCOs. Nicorandil, a KCO, attenuate major adverse cardiovascular event and the no-reflow phenomenon, reduces infarct size, decreases the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The cardioprotective effect of KCOs is mediated by opening of mitochondrial KATP (mitoKATP ) and sarcolemmal KATP (sarcKATP ) channels, triggered free radicals' production, and kinases activation.\n",

      "Ex-vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) may serve as a platform for the pharmacological repair of lung grafts before transplantation (LTx). We hypothesized that EVLP could also permit non-pharmacological repair through the induction of a heat shock response, which confers stress adaptation via the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Therefore, we evaluated whether transient heat application during EVLP (thermal preconditioning, TP) might recondition damaged lungs before LTx. TP was performed during EVLP (3h) of rat lungs damaged by warm ischemia, by transiently heating (30 min, 41.5°) the EVLP perfusate, followed by LTx (2h reperfusion). We also assessed TP (30 min, 42°) during EVLP (4h) of swine lungs damaged by prolonged cold ischemia. In rat lungs, TP induced HSP expression, reduced NFκB and inflammasome activity, oxidative stress, epithelial injury, inflammatory cytokines, necroptotic death signaling, and the expression of genes involved in innate immune and cell death pathways. After LTx, heated lungs displayed reduced inflammation, edema, histological damage, improved compliance, but unchanged oxygenation. In pig lungs, TP induced HSP expression, reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, epithelial damage, vascular resistance, and ameliorated compliance. Collectively, these data indicate that transient heat application during EVLP promotes significant reconditioning of damaged lungs and improves their outcomes after transplantation.\n",

      "Rationale: Myocardial injury triggers intense oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and cytokine release, which are essential for myocardial repair and remodeling. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and inflammation elimination have long been considered to reverse myocardial injuries. However, the efficacy of traditional treatments (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory drugs and natural enzymes) is still poor due to their intrinsic defects such as unfavorable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, low biological stability, and potential side effects. Nanozyme represents a candidate to effectively modulate redox homeostasis for the treatment of ROS related inflammation diseases. Methods: We develop an integrated bimetallic nanozyme derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) to eliminate ROS and alleviate inflammation. The bimetallic nanozyme (Cu-TCPP-Mn) is synthesized by embedding manganese and copper into the porphyrin followed by sonication, which could mimic the cascade activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to transform oxygen radicals to hydrogen peroxide, followed by the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. Enzyme kinetic analysis and oxygen-production velocities analysis were performed to evaluate the enzymatic activities of Cu-TCPP-Mn. We also established myocardial infarction (MI) and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury animal models to verify the ROS scavenging and anti-inflammation effect of Cu-TCPP-Mn. Results: As demonstrated by kinetic analysis and oxygen-production velocities analysis, Cu-TCPP-Mn nanozyme possesses good performance in both SOD- and CAT-like activities to achieve synergistic ROS scavenging effect and provide protection for myocardial injury. In both MI and I/R injury animal models, this bimetallic nanozyme represents a promising and reliable technology to protect the heart tissue from oxidative stress and inflammation-induced injury, and enables the myocardial function to recover from otherwise severe damage. Conclusions: This research provides a facile and applicable method to develop a bimetallic MOF nanozyme, which represents a promising alternative to the treatment of myocardial injuries.\n",

      "Introduction: Dexamethasone (DEX), as an important enduring-effect glucocorticoid (GC), holds great promise in the field of lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) comprehensive therapy owing to its immunomodulatory properties, such as inducing apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. However, its potent anti-inflammatory application is still restricted because of multiple internal physiologic barriers. Methods: Herein, we developed upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) coated with photosensitizer/capping agent/fluorescent probe-modified mesoporous silica (UCNPs@mSiO2[DEX]-Py/β-CD/FITC, USDPFs) for precise DEX release synergistic LIRI comprehensive therapy. The UCNPs were designed by covering an inert YOF:Yb shell on the YOF:Yb, Tm core to achieve high-intensity blue and red upconversion emission upon Near-Infrared (NIR) laser irradiation. Results: Under suitable compatibility conditions, the molecular structure of photosensitizer can be damaged along with capping agent shedding, which endowed USDPFs with an outstanding capability to carry out DEX release controlling and fluorescent indicator targeting. Furthermore, the hybrid encapsulating of DEX significantly increased utilization of nano-drugs, improving the water solubility and bioavailability, which was conducive to developing the anti-inflammatory performance of USDPFs in the complex clinical environment. Discussion: The response-controlled release of DEX in the intrapulmonary microenvironment can reduce normal cell damage, which can effectively avoid the side effects of nano-drugs in anti-inflammatory application. Meanwhile, the multi-wavelength of UCNPs endowed nano-drugs with the fluorescence emission imaging capacity in an intrapulmonary microenvironment, providing precise guidance for LIRI.\n",

We investigated the potential renoprotective effect of nebivolol, a β1 adrenergic receptor blocker, against renal I-R injury. We focused on the role of nebivolol in activating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, Akt (protein kinase B) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) transcription factors, which contribute to oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis during renal I-R. We divided 20 adult male Wistar albino rats into three experimental groups. Group 1 was a sham control in which only laparotomy was performed. Group 2 was the I-R group in which both kidneys were made ischemic for 45 min, then reperfused for 24 h. Group 3 was the I-R + nebivolol group in which 10 mg/kg nebivolol was administrated by gavage for 7 days before I-R. We measured Inflammation, oxidative stress and active caspase-3 as well as activation of p38 MAPK, Akt (protein kinase B) and NFκB transcription factor. Nebivolol significantly reduced oxidative stress and increased superoxide dismutase levels during renal I-R. We found that nebivolol significantly decreased interstitial inflammation, and TNF-α and interleukin-1β mRNA expression. Nebivolol significantly reduced active caspase-3 and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) expressions. Nebivolol also significantly decreased activation of p38 MAPK signaling and NFκB, and induced Akt activation during renal I-R.

Head down tilt 15° (HDT15) is a simple, low cost and accessible procedure that could be applied as an emergency treatment, before recanalization therapies, with the aim to increase cerebral collateral flow. Spontaneously hypertensive rats have been shown to display anatomical differences in morphology and function of cerebral collaterals, compared to other rat strains, resulting in an overall poor collateral circulation. We investigate the efficacy and safety of HDT15 in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats, which were considered as an animal stroke model with poor collaterals. Cerebral ischemia was induced by 90 minute endovascular occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). SHR rats were randomized to HDT15 or flat position (n = 19). HDT15 was applied 30 minutes after occlusion and lasted 60 minutes, until reperfusion. HDT15 application increased cerebral perfusion (+16.6% versus +6.1%; p = 0.0040) and resulted in a small reduction of infarct size (83.6 versus 107.1 mm3; - 21.89%; p = 0.0272), but it was not associated with early neurological improvement, compared to flat position. Our study suggests that the response to HDT15 during MCA occlusion is dependent on baseline collaterals.

This study aimed to investigate the role of KLF10/CTRP3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R)-induced brain microvascular endothelial cells injury, as well as the regulatory effects of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. OGD/R-induced human microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) were used to simulate the model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The expression of KLF10/CTRP3 in OGD/R-induced hBMECs as well as the transfection efficiency were all detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. The interaction of KLF10 and CTRP3 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). The viability, apoptosis and endothelial permeability of OGD/R-induced hBMECs was detected by CCK-8, TUNEL and FITC-Dextran assay kit. The capacity of cell migration was assessed by wound healing assay. The expression of apoptosis related proteins, oxidative stress levels and tight junction proteins was also detected. As a result, the expression of KLF10 was increased in OGD/R-induced hBMECs and downregulation of KLF10 could promote the viability, migration and suppress the apoptosis, oxidative stress and endothelial permeability by downregulating the expression of caspase 3, Bax, cleaved PARP, ROS, MDA, and upregulating the expression of Bcl-2, SOD, GSH-Px, ZO-1, occludin, claudin-5. Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway was inhibited in OGD/R-induced hBMECs, which was activated by downregulation of KLF10. KLF10 was demonstrated to be combined with CTRP3 and KLF10 inhibited transcription of CTRP3 in hBMECs. The above changes affected by downregulation of KLF10 could be reversed by the interference with CTRP3. In conclusion, KLF10 knockdown improved OGD/R-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell injury and barrier dysfunction through the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, which was weakened by the downregulation of CTRP3.\n",

Total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) parameters in the tissue were analyzed to investigate the oxidative stress occurring in the liver, pancreas, and heart, and Acyl-Coa synthetase long-chain family member (ACSL4). Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) enzyme levels were also analyzed by ELISA to investigate the effect on ferroptosis. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed for histopathological examination of the tissues. As a result of biochemical analyzes, it was observed that oxidative stress parameters increased significantly in the IR group. In addition, while the ACSL4 enzyme level increased in the IR group in all tissues, the GPx4 enzyme level decreased. In the histopathological examination, it was observed that IR caused serious damage to the heart, liver, and pancreas tissues. The present study shows that Curcumin and LoxBlock-1 have a protective effect on the liver, pancreas, and cardiac ferroptosis following the effect on AKI.

Previously, we screened differentially expressed genes in renal I/R mouse models and found that Tax1 binding protein 3 (Tip1) and baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (Birc3) are two upregulated genes in I/R. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of Tip1 and Birc3 in I/R models. We found that the expression of Tip1 and Birc3 was upregulated in I/R-treated mice, whereas Tip1 was downregulated and Birc3 was upregulated in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro models. By inhibiting Birc3 with AT-406 in I/R-treated mice, we observed that the serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen did not vary. However, inhibition of Birc3 enhanced apoptosis of kidney tissues induced by I/R treatment. Consistently, we found that inhibition of Birc3 also increased the apoptosis rate in tubular epithelial cells induced by OGD/R. These data demonstrated that Tip1 and Birc3 were upregulated in I/R injury. The upregulation of Birc3 may protect against renal I/R injury.\n",

      "With the increasing number of accepted candidates on waiting lists worldwide, there is an urgent need to expand the number and the quality of donor livers. Dynamic preservation approaches have demonstrated various benefits, including improving liver function and graft survival, and reducing liver injury and post-transplant complications. Consequently, organ perfusion techniques are being used in clinical practice in many countries. Despite this success, a proportion of livers do not meet current viability tests required for transplantation, even with the use of modern perfusion techniques. Therefore, devices are needed to further optimise machine liver perfusion - one promising option is to prolong machine liver perfusion for several days, with ex situ treatment of perfused livers. For example, stem cells, senolytics, or molecules targeting mitochondria or downstream signalling can be administered during long-term liver perfusion to modulate repair mechanisms and regeneration. Besides, today's perfusion equipment is also designed to enable the use of various liver bioengineering techniques, to develop scaffolds or for their re-cellularisation. Cells or entire livers can also undergo gene modulation to modify animal livers for xenotransplantation, to directly treat injured organs or to repopulate such scaffolds with \"repaired\" autologous cells. This review first discusses current strategies to improve the quality of donor livers, and secondly reports on bioengineering techniques to design optimised organs during machine perfusion. Current practice, as well as the benefits and challenges associated with these different perfusion strategies are discussed.\n",

      "Phagocytosis plays vital roles in injury and repair, while its regulation by properdin and innate repair receptor, a heterodimer receptor of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR)/β common receptor (βcR), in renal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) remains unclear. Properdin, a pattern recognition molecule, facilitates phagocytosis by opsonizing damaged cells. Our previous study showed that the phagocytic function of tubular epithelial cells isolated from properdin knockout (PKO) mouse kidneys was compromised, with upregulated EPOR in IR kidneys that was further raised by PKO at repair phase. Here, helix B surface peptide (HBSP), derived from EPO only recognizing EPOR/βcR, ameliorated IR-induced functional and structural damage in both PKO and wild-type (WT) mice. In particular, HBSP treatment led to less cell apoptosis and F4/80+ macrophage infiltration in the interstitium of PKO IR kidneys compared to the WT control. In addition, the expression of EPOR/βcR was increased by IR in WT kidneys, and furthered increased in IR PKO kidneys, but greatly reduced by HBSP in the IR kidneys of PKO mice. HBSP also increased PCNA expression in IR kidneys of both genotypes. Moreover, iridium-labelled HBSP (HBSP-Ir) was localized mainly in the tubular epithelia after 17-h renal IR in WT mice. HBSP-Ir also anchored to mouse kidney epithelial (TCMK-1) cells treated by H2O2. Both EPOR and EPOR/βcR were significantly increased by H2O2 treatment, while further increased EPOR was showed in cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting properdin, but a lower level of EPOR was seen in EPOR siRNA and HBSP-treated cells. The number of early apoptotic cells was increased by EPOR siRNA in H2O2-treated TCMK-1, but markedly reversed by HBSP. The phagocytic function of TCMK-1 cells assessed by uptake fluorescence-labelled E.coli was enhanced by HBSP dose-dependently. Our data demonstrate for the first time that HBSP improves the phagocytic function of tubular epithelial cells and kidney repair post IR injury, via upregulated EPOR/βcR triggered by both IR and properdin deficiency.\n",

      "Oxidative stress and inflammation are both involved in the pathogenesis of lung ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural product with cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The present study hypothesized that SFN may protect against lung I/R injury via the regulation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory-related pathways. A rat model of lung I/R injury was established, and rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Sham group, I/R group, and SFN group. It was shown that SFN protected against a pathological inflammatory response via inhibition of neutrophil accumulation and in the reduction of the serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. SFN treatment also significantly inhibited lung reactive oxygen species production, decreased the levels of 8-OH-dG and malondialdehyde, and reversed the decrease in the antioxidant activities of the enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in the lungs of the I/R treated rats. In addition, SFN ameliorated I/R-induced lung apoptosis in rats by suppressing Bax and cleaved caspase-3 levels and increased Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, SFN treatment activated an Nrf2-related antioxidant pathway, as indicated by the increased nuclear transfer of Nrf2 and the downstream HO-1 and NADPH quinone oxidoreductase-1. In conclusion, these findings suggested that SFN protected against I/R-induced lung lesions in rats via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the accompanied anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects.\n",

      "Retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) injury is involved in the pathogenesis of various vision-threatening diseases. The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is thought to be the main cause of RIR injury. A variety of natural products, including quercetin (Que), exhibit potent antioxidant activity. However, the lack of an efficient delivery system for hydrophobic Que and the presence of various intraocular barriers limit the effective retinal delivery of Que in clinical settings. In this study, we encapsulated Que into ROS-responsive mitochondria-targeted liposomes (abbreviated to Que@TPP-ROS-Lips) to achieve the sustained delivery of Que to the retina. The intracellular uptake, lysosome escape ability, and mitochondria targeting ability of Que@TPP-ROS-Lips were evaluated in R28 retinal cells. Treating R28 cells with Que@TPP-ROS-Lips significantly ameliorated the decrease in ATP content, ROS generation, and increase in the release of lactate dehydrogenase in an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model of retinal ischemia. In a rat model, the intravitreal injection of Que@TPP-ROS-Lips 24 h after inducing retinal ischemia significantly enhanced retinal electrophysiological recovery and reduced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Que@TPP-ROS-Lips were taken up by retina for at least 14 days after intravitreal administration. Molecular docking and functional biological experiments revealed that Que targets FOXO3A to inhibit oxidative stress and inflammation. Que@TPP-ROS-Lips also partially inhibited the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, which contributes to oxidative stress and inflammation. In conclusion, our new platform for ROS-responsive and mitochondria-targeted drug release shows promise for the treatment of RIR injury and promotes the clinical application of hydrophobic natural products.\n",

      "Noninvasive delivery of near-infrared light (IRL) to human tissues has been researched as a treatment for several acute and chronic disease conditions. We recently showed that use of specific IRL wavelengths, which inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX), leads to robust neuroprotection in animal models of focal and global brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. These life-threatening conditions can be caused by an ischemic stroke or cardiac arrest, respectively, two leading causes of death. To translate IRL therapy into the clinic an effective technology must be developed that allows efficient delivery of IRL to the brain while addressing potential safety concerns. Here, we introduce IRL delivery waveguides (IDWs) which meet these demands. We employ a low-durometer silicone that comfortably conforms to the shape of the head, avoiding pressure points. Furthermore, instead of using focal IRL delivery points via fiberoptic cables, lasers, or light-emitting diodes, the distribution of the IRL across the entire area of the IDW allows uniform IRL delivery through the skin and into the brain, preventing \"hot spots\" and thus skin burns. The IRL delivery waveguides have unique design features, including optimized IRL extraction step numbers and angles and a protective housing. The design can be scaled to fit various treatment areas, providing a novel IRL delivery interface platform. Using fresh (unfixed) human cadavers and isolated cadaver tissues, we tested transmission of IRL via IDWs in comparison to laser beam application with fiberoptic cables. Using the same IRL output energies IDWs performed superior in comparison to the fiberoptic delivery, leading to an up to 95% and 81% increased IRL transmission for 750 and 940 nm IRL, respectively, analyzed at a depth of 4 cm into the human head. We discuss the unique safety features and potential further improvements of the IDWs for future clinical implementation.\n",

Furthermore, the pharmacological inhibition of AhR activation after ischemia has been shown to attenuate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Here, we investigated whether AhR antagonist administration after ischemia was also effective in ameliorating hepatic IR injury. A 70% partial hepatic IR (45-min ischemia and 24-h reperfusion) injury was induced in rats. We administered 6,2',4'-trimethoxyflavone (TMF, 5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally 10 min after ischemia. Hepatic IR injury was observed using serum, magnetic resonance imaging-based liver function indices, and liver samples. TMF-treated rats showed significantly lower relative enhancement (RE) values and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase levels than did untreated rats at 3 h after reperfusion. After 24 h of reperfusion, TMF-treated rats had significantly lower RE values, ΔT1 values, serum ALT levels, and necrotic area percentage than did untreated rats. The expression of the apoptosis-related proteins, Bax and cleaved caspase-3, was significantly lower in TMF-treated rats than in untreated rats. This study demonstrated that inhibition of AhR activation after ischemia was effective in ameliorating IR-induced liver injury in rats.\n",

Optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1), an important factor in mitochondrial fusion, has been shown to be upregulated by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i). Also, the antiinflammatory effects of SGLT2i have been demonstrated in renal cells. Thus, we hypothesized that empagliflozin could prevent IRI through inhibiting mitochondrial division and reducing inflammation.\n",

      "Through animal experiments and sequencing analysis, we first confirmed the protection against IRI and the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics-related factors and inflammatory factors by empagliflozin pretreatment. Then, through hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) cellular experiments, we confirmed that empagliflozin could inhibit mitochondrial shortening and division and upregulate OPA1 in human renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) cells. Subsequently, we knocked down OPA1, and mitochondrial division and shortening were observed, which could be alleviated by empagliflozin treatment. Combined with the previous results, we concluded that OPA1 downregulation leads to mitochondrial division and shortening, and empagliflozin can alleviate the condition by upregulating OPA1. We further explored the pathway through which empagliflozin functions. Related studies have shown the activation of AMPK pathway by empagliflozin and the close correlation between the AMPK pathway and OPA1. In our study, we blocked the AMPK pathway, and OPA1 upregulation by empagliflozin was not observed, thus demonstrating the dependence of empagliflozin on the AMPK pathway.\n",

Among them, 15 chemical components, such as salidroside, morin, diosmetin, and gallic acid were identified as key active compounds. Ten core targets, including AKT1, VEGF, PTGS2, and STAT3, were discovered through the analysis of the PPI network constructed from 124 common potential targets. These possible targets were involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and HIF-1/VEGF/PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Furthermore, molecular docking confirmed that the potential bioactive compounds in RG have good potential binding abilities to AKT1, VEGFA, PTGS2, STAT3, and HIF-1α proteins. Then, the animal experiments showed that RG could significantly improve the cardiac function of I/R rats, reduce the size of myocardial infarction, improve the myocardial structure, and reduce the degree of myocardial fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and myocardial cell apoptosis rate in I/R rats. In addition, we also found that RG could decrease the concentration of AGE, Ox-LDL, MDA, MPO, XOD, SDH, Ca2+, and ROS, and increase the concentration of Trx, TrxR1, SOD, T-AOC, NO, ATP, Na+k+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and CCO.

      "Cardiac ischemia/reperfusion(I/R) induced-cardiac vascular endothelial injury is an important pathological process that appears in the early stage of cardiac I/R injury. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. However, in cardiac I/R injury, the role of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway is controversial. The present study aimed to use oxygen-glucose deprivation/oxygen-glucose resupply(OGD/OGR) in human coronary artery endothelial cells(HCAECs) with I/R injury to assess the role of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in I/R-induced endothelial injury. The results revealed lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux in endothelial cells exposed to OGD/OGR. Meanwhile, our data showed that the levels of cathepsin D(CTSD) decreased time-dependently. Knockdown of CTSD caused lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagic flux. Conversely, restoration of CTSD levels protected HCAECs against OGD/OGR induced-defects in autophagy-lysosomal function and cellular damage. Our findings indicated that I/R induced-impaired autophagic flux, rather than excessive autophagic initiation, mediates endothelial cells injury. The maintenance of autophagy-lysosomal function is critical to protect endothelial cells against I/R injury, and CTSD is a key regulator. Thus, strategies focused on restoring CTSD function are potentially novel treatments for cardiac reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα) is a nuclear transcription factor that extensively regulates energy metabolism in cardiovascular diseases. Identification of targeted RXRα drugs for heart failure (HF) therapy is urgently needed. Neocryptotanshinone (NCTS) is a component derived from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, the effect and mechanism of which for treating HF have not been reported. The goal of this study was to explore the pharmacological effects of NCTS on energy metabolism to protect against HF post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) via RXRα. We established a left anterior descending artery ligation-induced HF post-AMI model in mice and an oxygen-glucose deprivation-reperfusion-induced H9c2 cell model to investigate the cardioprotective effect of NCTS. Component-target binding techniques, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), microscale thermophoresis (MST) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection were applied to explore the potential mechanism by which NCTS targets RXRα. The results showed that NCTS protects the heart against ischaemic damage, evidenced by improvement of cardiac dysfunction and attenuation of cellular hypoxic injury. Importantly, the SPR and MST results showed that NCTS has a high binding affinity for RXRα. Meanwhile, the critical downstream target genes of RXRα/PPARα, which are involved in fatty acid metabolism, including Cd36 and Cpt1a, were upregulated under NCTS treatment. Moreover, NCTS enhanced TFAM levels, promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and increased myocardial adenosine triphosphate levels by activating RXRα. In conclusion, we confirmed that NCTS improves myocardial energy metabolism, including fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis, by regulating the RXRα/PPARα pathway in mice with HF post-AMI.\n",

      "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) is a relatively common complication of liver resection and transplantation that is intimately connected to oxidative stress. The superoxide anion radical (O2•-), as the first reactive oxygen species produced by organisms, is an important marker of HIRI. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential site for O2•- production, especially ER oxidative stress, which is closely linked to HIRI. Thus, dynamic variations in ER O2•- may accurately indicate the HIRI extent. However, there is still a lack of tools for the dynamic reversible detection of ER O2•-. Therefore, we designed and prepared an ER-targeted fluorescent reversible probe DPC for real-time tracing of O2•- fluctuations. We successfully observed a marked increase in ER O2•- levels in HIRI mice. A potential NADPH oxidase 4-ER O2•--SERCA2b-caspase 4 signaling pathway in HIRI mice was also revealed. Attractively, DPC was successfully used for precise fluorescent navigation and excision of HIRI sites.\n",

To thoroughly assess the microglial phenotypes, we made the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice to simulate the acute pathological processes of ischemic stroke from normal conditions to acute cerebral ischemia and then to the early reperfusion period. The temporal changes in gene profiles, cell subtypes, and microglial function were comprehensively analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 37,614 microglial cells and divided them into eight distinct subpopulations. Mic_home, Mic_pre1, and Mic_pre2 subpopulations were three clusters mainly composed of cells from the control samples, in which Mic_home was a homeostatic subpopulation characterized by high expression of Hpgd and Tagap, and Mic_pre1 and Mic_pre2 were two clusters with preliminary inflammatory activation characteristics marked by P2ry13 and Wsb1 respectively. Mic_M1L1 and Mic_M1L2 subpopulations exhibited M1-like polarization manifested by the upregulation of inflammatory genes after ischemic stroke, while the intrinsic heterogeneity on the level of inflammatory responses and neurotrophic support properties was observed. Moreover, we identified three unique clusters of cells with low inflammation levels. Mic_np1, Mic_np2, and Mic_np3 were characterized by high expression of Arhgap45, Rgs10, and Pkm respectively. However, these cells did not show significant M2-like characteristics and their classic microglia function was also attenuated. These subpopulations exhibited higher activation of neuropeptide functional pathways. At last, we performed cell-cell communication analysis and identified major couplings contributing to the interaction between microglia and other cell populations. In summary, our study elucidated the temporal heterogeneity of microglia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, which may facilitate the identification of effective neuroprotective targets to curb ischemic damage at an early stage.\n",

This study uncovered the regulatory mechanisms of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis during cardiac I/R injury. H9c2 cells were stimulated with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Cell viability and pyroptosis were detected by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. Western blotting or RT-qPCR was performed to analyze target molecule expression. NLRP3 and Caspase-1 expression was observed by immunofluorescence staining. IL-18 and IL-1β production was detected by ELISA. The total m6A and m6A level of CBL was determined by dot blot assay and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR, respectively. The interaction between IGF2BP3 and CBL mRNA was confirmed by RNA pull-down and RIP assays. The protein interaction between CBL and β-catenin and β-catenin ubiquitination were evaluated by Co-IP. Myocardial I/R model was established in rats. We determined infarct size by TTC staining and pathological changes by H&E staining. LDH, CK-MB, LVFS, and LVEF were also assessed. FTO and β-catenin were down-regulated, while CBL was up-regulated by OGD/R stimulation. FTO/β-catenin overexpression or CBL silencing restrained OGD/R-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. CBL repressed β-catenin expression via ubiquitination and degradation. FTO reduced the mRNA stability of CBL by inhibiting m6A modification. CBL-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin were involved in FTO-induced pyroptosis inhibition during myocardial I/R injury.

      "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of death in cardiovascular disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an important method for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD), and it has greatly reduced the mortality of ACS patients since its application. However, a series of new problems may occur after PCI, such as in-stent restenosis, no-reflow phenomenon, in-stent neoatherosclerosis, late stent thrombosis, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias, which result in the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) that seriously reduce the postoperative benefit for patients. The inflammatory response is a key mechanism of MACE after PCI. Therefore, examining effective anti-inflammatory therapies after PCI in patients with ACS is a current research focus to reduce the incidence of MACE. The pharmacological mechanism and clinical efficacy of routine Western medicine treatment for the anti-inflammatory treatment of CHD have been verified. Many Chinese medicine (CM) preparations have been widely used in the treatment of CHD. Basic and clinical studies showed that effectiveness of the combination of CM and Western medicine treatments in reducing incidence of MACE after PCI was better than Western medicine treatment alone. The current paper reviewed the potential mechanism of the inflammatory response and occurrence of MACE after PCI in patients with ACS and the research progress of combined Chinese and Western medicine treatments in reducing incidence of MACE.

      "Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in dying cells undergoing pyroptosis or apoptosis requires the cell-surface protein NINJ11. PMR releases proinflammatory cytoplasmic molecules, collectively called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), that activate immune cells. Therefore, inhibiting NINJ1 and PMR may limit the inflammation that is associated with excessive cell death. Here we describe an anti-NINJ1 monoclonal antibody, specifically targeting murine NINJ1, that blocks oligomerization of NINJ1 and prevents PMR. By electron microscopy, this antibody prevented NINJ1 from forming oligomeric filaments. In mice, inhibition of NINJ1 or Ninj1 deficiency ameliorated hepatocellular PMR induced with TNF plus D-Galactosamine, concanavalin A, Jo2 anti-Fas agonist antibody, or ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Accordingly, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver enzymes alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and DAMPs interleukin 18 (IL-18) and HMGB1 were reduced. Moreover, in the liver IRI model, there was an attendant reduction in neutrophil infiltration. These data indicate that NINJ1 mediates PMR and inflammation in diseases driven by aberrant hepatocellular death.\n",

      "Ischemic stroke has extremely high mortality and disability rates worldwide. miR-204-5p has been reported to be associated with neurological diseases. However, the relationship linking miR-204-5p to ischemic stroke and its molecular mechanism remain unclear. Herein, we found that expression of miR-204-5p was significantly decreased while EphA4 increased in vivo and vitro, which reached the peak at 24 h after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Then, we altered miR-204-5p expression in rats by cerebroventricular injection. Our study showed that miR-204-5p overexpression obviously reduced the brain infarction area and neurological score. We successfully cultured neurons to investigate the downstream mechanism. Upregulation of miR-204-5p increased cell viability and suppressed the release of LDH. Moreover, the proportion of apoptotic cells tested by TUNEL and flow cytometry and protein expression of Cleaved Caspase3 and Bax were inhibited. The relative expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β was repressed. In contrary, knockdown of miR-204-5p showed the opposite results. Bioinformatics and a dual luciferase assay illustrated that EphA4 was a target gene. Further research studies demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of miR-204-5p could be partially mitigated by upregulating EphA4. Next, we proved that the miR-204-5p/EphA4 axis furtherly activated the PI3K/AKT pathway. We thoroughly illustrated the role of neuroinflammation and apoptosis. However, whether there are other mechanisms associated with the EphA4/PI3K/AKT pathway needs further investigation. Altogether, the miR-204-5p axis ameliorates neurological injury via the EphA4/PI3K/AKT pathway, which is expected to serve as an effective treatment for ischemic stroke.\n",

      "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a serious neurological disease. Normobaric hyperoxia (NBHO) is both a non-invasive and easy method that seems to be able to improve outcomes after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In clinical trials, normal low-flow oxygen has been shown to be ineffective, but NBHO has been shown to have a transient brain-protective effect. Today, NBHO combined with recanalization is the best treatment available. NBHO combined with thrombolysis is considered to improve neurological scores and long-term outcomes. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), however, are still needed to determine the role they will have in stroke treatment. RCTs of NBHO combined with thrombectomy have both improved infarct volume at 24 hours and the long-term prognosis. These two mechanisms most likely play key roles in the neuroprotective actions of NBHO after recanalization, including the increase in penumbra oxygen supply and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Considering the mechanism of action of NBHO, oxygen should be given as early as possible to increase the duration of oxygen therapy before recanalization is initiated. NBHO can further prolong the existence time of penumbra, so that more patients may benefit from it. Overall, however, recanalization therapy is still essential.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remains a grievous health threat, and herein effective therapy is urgently needed. This study explored the protection of neuroglobin (Ngb) in rats with cerebral I/R injury. The focal cerebral I/R rat models were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and neuronal injury models were established by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment. The brain injury of rats was assessed. Levels of Ngb, Bcl-2, Bax, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related markers, and Syt1 were measured by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. The cytotoxicity in neurons was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Levels of intracellular Ca2+ and mitochondrial function-related indicators were determined. The binding between Ngb and Syt1 was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. Ngb was upregulated in cerebral I/R rats and its overexpression alleviated brain injury. In OGD/R-induced neurons, Ngb overexpression decreased LDH level and neuronal apoptosis, decreased Ca2+ content, and mitigated mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS-related apoptosis. However, Ngb silencing imposed the opposite effects. Importantly, Ngb could bind to Syt1. Syt1 knockdown partially counteracted the alleviation of Ngb on OGD/R-induced injury in neurons and cerebral I/R injury in rats. Briefly, Ngb extenuated cerebral I/R injury by repressing mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated neuronal apoptosis through Syt1.\n",

      "Background: Neurologic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 include potentially malignant cerebrovascular events arising from complex hemodynamic, hematologic, and inflammatory processes occurring in concert. Objective: This study concerns the hypothesis that, despite angiographic reperfusion, COVID-19 promotes continued consumption of at-risk tissue volumes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) unlike what is seen with COVID-negative individuals, yielding critical insights into prognostication and monitoring paradigms in vaccine-naïve patients experiencing AIS. Methods: This retrospective study compared 100 consecutively presenting patients with COVID-19 and AIS between March 2020 and April 2021 with a contemporaneous cohort of 282 patients with AIS who did not have COVID-19. Reperfusion classes were dichotomized into positive (extended thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia [eTICI] score = 2c-3) and negative (eTICI score < 2c) groups. All patients underwent endovascular therapy following initial CT perfusion imaging (CTP) to document infarction core and total hypoperfusion volumes. Results: Ten COVID-positive (mean age ± SD, 67 ± 6 years; seven men, three women) and 144 COVID-negative patients (mean age, 71 ± 10 years; 76 men, 68 women) undergoing endovascular reperfusion with antecedent CTP and follow-up imaging comprised the final dataset. Initial infarction core and total hypoperfusion volumes were 1.5 ± 18 mL and 85 ± 100 mL in COVID-negative patients and 30.5 ± 34 mL and 117 ± 80.5 mL in COVID-positive patients, respectively. Final infarction volumes were significantly larger in patients with COVID-19, with median volumes of 77.8 mL versus 18.2 mL among control patients (p = .01), as were normalized measures of infarction growth relative to baseline infarction volume (p = .05). In adjusted logistic parametric regression models, COVID positivity emerged as a significant predictor for continued infarct growth (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.0-25.95]; p = .05). Conclusion: These findings support the potentially aggressive clinical course of cerebrovascular events in patients with COVID-19, suggesting greater infarction growth and ongoing consumption of at-risk tissues, even following angiographic reperfusion. Clinical Impact: SARS-CoV-2 infection may promote continued infarction progression, despite angiographic reperfusion, in vaccine-naïve patients with large-vessel occlusion AIS. The findings carry potential implications for prognostication, treatment selection, and surveillance for infarction growth among revascularized patients in future waves of infection by novel viral strains.\n",

Our previous study found that LIPUS treatment could halt the chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in mice; unexpectedly, we observed the improvement of CKD-reduced muscle weights by LIPUS treatment. Here, we further tested the protective potential of LIPUS on CKD-associated muscle wasting/sarcopenia using the CKD mouse models. Mouse models of both unilateral renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) with nephrectomy and adenine administration were used to induce CKD. LIPUS with condition of 3 MHz, 100 mW/cm2, 20 min/day was applied to the kidney of CKD mice. LIPUS treatment significantly reversed the increased serum BUN/creatinine levels in CKD mice. LIPUS effectively prevented the decrease in grip strength, muscle weight (soleus, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles), cross-section areas of muscle fibres, and muscular phosphorylated Akt protein expression by immunohistochemistry, and the increase in muscular atrogenes Atrogin1 and MuRF1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in CKD mice. These results indicated that LIPUS could help improve weak muscle strength, muscle mass loss, muscle atrophy-related protein expression, and Akt inactivation. LIPUS application may be an alternative non-invasive therapeutic intervention on the management of CKD-associated muscle wasting.\n",

Eighteen female Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups (Sham (SG), ischemia-reperfusion (OIR), and ischemia-reperfusion+tocilizumab (OIRT)). Degeneration, necrosis, vascular dilatation/congestion, interstitial edema, hemorrhage, and polymorphonuclear lymphocyte (PMNL) infiltration scores were significantly different between the groups (p=0.001 for all parameters). Moreover, the OIRT group had a significant improvement in these criteria compared to the OIR group (p<0.05). Additionally, there was a considerable difference between OIRT and OIR groups in the number of primordial, developing, and atretic follicles groups (p<0.05), while there was no difference in the number of corpus luteum (p=0.052). Stress markers or cytokines, such as MDA, tGSH, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, were significantly different between groups (p<0.05).

In this study, we investigated the role of SDMA in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis and explored its underlying mechanisms.\n",

SDMA was injected into kidneys through ureter retrogradely. TGF-β stimulated human renal epithelial (HK2) cells were used as an in vitro model and treated with SDMA. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 (STAT4) was inhibited by berbamine dihydrochloride or siRNA or overexpressed by plasmids in vitro. Masson staining and Western blotting were performed to evaluate renal fibrosis. Quantitative PCR was performed to validate findings derived from RNA sequencing analysis.\n",

      "We observed that SDMA (from 0.01 to 10 µM) dose-dependently inhibited the expression of pro-fibrotic markers in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells. Intrarenal administration of SDMA (2.5 µmol/kg or 25 µmol/kg) dose-dependently attenuated renal fibrosis in UUO kidneys. A significant increase in SDMA concentration (from 19.5 to 117.7 nmol/g, p < 0.001) in mouse kidneys was observed after renal injection which was assessed by LC-MS/MS. We further showed that intrarenal administration of SDMA attenuated renal fibrosis in UIRI induced mouse fibrotic kidneys. Through RNA sequencing analysis, we found that the expression of STAT4 was reduced by SDMA in UUO kidneys, which was further confirmed by quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis in mouse fibrotic kidneys and renal cells. Inhibition of STAT4 by berbamine dihydrochloride (0.3 mg/ml or 3.3 mg/ml) or siRNA reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic markers in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells. Furthermore, blockage of STAT4 attenuated the anti-fibrotic effect of SDMA in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells. Conversely, overexpression of STAT4 reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of SDMA in TGF-β stimulated HK2 cells.\n",

      "Recent studies have shown that the potential regulatory role of N6-methyladenine (m6A) modification may affect the occurrence and development of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the regulatory mechanism of m6A modification on myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI) is rarely reported. A mouse model of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R) was established by ligation and perfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and a cellular model of hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) was conducted in cardiomyocytes (CMs). We found that the protein expression of ALKBH5 in myocardial tissues and cells were decreased, accompanied by increased m6A modification level. Overexpression of ALKBH5 significantly inhibited H/R-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in CMs. Mechanistically, there was an enriched m6A motif in the 3'-UTR of SIRT1 genome, and ALKBH5 overexpression promoted the stability of SIRT1 mRNA. Furthermore, results using overexpression or knockdown of SIRT1 confirmed the protective effect of SIRT1 on H/R induced CMs apoptosis. Together, our study reveals a critical role of ALKBH5-medicated m6A on CM apoptosis, supplying an important regulating effect of m6A methylation in ischemic heart disease.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury contributes to severe injury for cardiomyocytes. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of TFAP2C on cell autophagy in MI/R injury. MTT assay measured cell viability. The cells injury was evaluated by commercial kits. IF detected the level of LC3B. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay, ChIP or RIP assay were performed to verify the interactions between crucial molecules. We found that TFAP2C and SFRP5 expression were decreased while miR-23a-5p and Wnt5a increased in AC16 cells in response to H/R condition. H/R induction led to cell injury and induced autophagy, which were reversed by TFAP2C overexpression or 3-MA treatment (an autophagy inhibitor). Mechanistically, TFAP2C suppressed miR-23a expression through binding to miR-23a promoter, and SFRP5 was a target gene of miR-23a-5p. Moreover, miR-23a-5p overexpression or rapamycin reversed the protective impacts of TFAP2C overexpression on cells injury and autophagy upon H/R condition. In conclusion, TFAP2C inhibited autophagy to improve H/R-induced cells injury by mediating miR-23a-5p/SFRP5/Wnt5a axis.\n",

      "Ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) expression was reported to be increased in response to ischemic brain damage, but the biological role and underlying mechanism remain little understood. USP22 shRNA was intravenously injected into the mouse brain, and then a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) mouse model was constructed, and the infarct volume, neurobehavioral deficit score, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy in vivo were evaluated. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) treated pheochromocytoma-12 (PC12) cells were used as an in vitro model of ischemia/reperfusion. The effects of USP22 on proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy were explored by CCK-8, flow cytometry, ELISA, and Western blot assays. The relationship between USP22 and the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was measured by Co-IP and Western blot assays. Both USP22 and PTEN were highly expressed in MCAO/R mouse brain tissues and OGD/R-induced PC12 cells. In vitro, USP22 knockdown strongly improved OGD/R-mediated changes in cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production in PC12 cells. USP22 bound to PTEN and stabilized PTEN expression by decreasing its ubiquitination. PTEN overexpression reversed the promoting effect of USP22 knockdown on cell viability and the inhibitory effects of USP22 knockdown on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and LDH release rate in PC12 cells subjected to OGD/R. PTEN silencing elevated the protein levels of p62, p-mTOR, TFEB, and LAMP1 and reduced the protein levels of LC3-II/LC3-I. USP22 expression levels were negatively correlated with mTOR expression levels, and USP22-shRNA-mediated expression of p62, p-mTOR, TFEB, and LAMP1 was reversed by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR. In vivo, USP22 silencing significantly alleviated infarct volume, neurobehavioral impairments, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and autophagy in MCAO/R mice. USP22 knockdown exerts neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by downregulating PTEN and activating the mTOR/TFEB pathway.\n",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and reactive sulfur species (RSS) are direct participants and important biomarkers of oxidative stress. A comprehensive understanding of their changes can help us evaluate disease pathogenesis and progression and facilitate early diagnosis and drug development. In recent years, fluorescent probes have been developed for real-time monitoring of ROS, RNS and RSS levels in vitro and in vivo. In this review, conventional design strategies of fluorescent probes for ROS, RNS, and RSS detection are discussed from three aspects: fluorophores, linkers, and recognition groups. We introduce representative fluorescent probes for ROS, RNS, and RSS detection in cells, physiological/pathological processes (e.g., Inflammation, Drug Induced Organ Injury and Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury etc.), and specific diseases (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy, depression, diabetes and cancer, etc.).

      "During aging, heart structure and function gradually deteriorate, which subsequently increases susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion (IR). Maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis is critical for cardiac contractility. We used Langendorff's model to monitor the susceptibility of aging (6-, 15-, and 24-month-old) hearts to IR, with a specific focus on Ca2+-handling proteins. IR, but not aging itself, triggered left ventricular changes when the maximum rate of pressure development decreased in 24-month-olds, and the maximum rate of relaxation was most affected in 6-month-old hearts. Aging caused a deprivation of Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, and ryanodine receptor contents. IR-induced damage to ryanodine receptor stimulates Ca2+ leakage in 6-month-old hearts and elevated phospholamban (PLN)-to-SERCA2a ratio can slow down Ca2+ reuptake seen at 2-5 μM Ca2+. Total and monomeric PLN mirrored the response of overexpressed SERCA2a after IR in 24-month-old hearts, resulting in stable Ca2+-ATPase activity. Upregulated PLN accelerated inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity at low free Ca2+ in 15-month-old after IR, and reduced SERCA2a content subsequently impairs the Ca2+-sequestering capacity. In conclusion, our study suggests that aging is associated with a significant decrease in the abundance and function of Ca2+-handling proteins. However, the IR-induced damage was not increased during aging.\n",

      "Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Neurogenesis plays a crucial role in postischemic functional recovery. Alcohol dose-dependently affects the prognosis of ischemic stroke. We investigated the impact of light alcohol consumption (LAC) on neurogenesis under physiological conditions and following ischemic stroke. C57BL/6J mice (three months old) were fed with 0.7 g/kg/day ethanol (designed as LAC) or volume-matched water (designed as control) daily for eight weeks. To evaluate neurogenesis, the numbers of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)+/doublecortin (DCX)+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ neurons were assessed in the subventricular zone (SVZ), dentate gyrus (DG), ischemic cortex, and ischemic striatum. The locomotor activity was determined by the accelerating rotarod and open field tests. LAC significantly increased BrdU+/DCX+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the SVZ under physiological conditions. Ischemic stroke dramatically increased BrdU+/DCX+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the DG, SVZ, ischemic cortex, and ischemic striatum. The increase in BrdU+/DCX+ cells was significantly greater in LAC mice compared to the control mice. In addition, LAC significantly increased BrdU+/NeuN+ cells by about three folds in the DG, SVZ, and ischemic cortex. Furthermore, LAC reduced ischemic brain damage and improved locomotor activity. Therefore, LAC may protect the brain against ischemic stroke by promoting neurogenesis.\n",

Patients (n = 120) were randomly assigned to an HHP and a control group. A safe, inhaled oxygen fraction for the hypoxic preconditioning phase (10-14% oxygen for 10 min) was determined by measuring the anaerobic threshold. At the hyperoxic phase, a 75-80% oxygen fraction was used for 30 min. The cumulative frequency of postoperative complications was 14 (23.3%) in the HHP vs. 23 (41.1%), p = 0.041.

However, the role of the celiac ganglion (CG) in HIRI remains unclear. Adeno-associated virus was used to silence Bmal1 expression in the CG of twelve beagles that were randomly assigned to the Bmal1 knockdown group (KO-Bmal1) and the control group. After four weeks, a canine HIRI model was established, and CG, liver tissue, and serum samples were collected for analysis. The virus significantly downregulated Bmal1 expression in the CG. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed a lower proportion of c-fos+ and NGF+ neurons in TH+ cells in the KO-Bmal1 group than in the control group. The KO-Bmal1 group exhibited lower Suzuki scores and serum ALT and AST levels than the control group. Bmal1 knockdown significantly reduced liver fat reserve, hepatocyte apoptosis, and liver fibrosis, and it increased liver glycogen accumulation. We also observed that Bmal1 downregulation inhibited the hepatic neurotransmitter norepinephrine, neuropeptide Y levels, and sympathetic nerve activity in HIRI. Finally, we confirmed that decreased Bmal1 expression in CG reduces TNF-α, IL-1β, and MDA levels and increases GSH levels in the liver. The downregulation of Bmal1 expression in CG suppresses neural activity and improves hepatocyte injury in the beagle model after HIRI.\n",

      "Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me) is an oleanane triterpenoid in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of patients with diabetic kidney disease. Preclinical studies in rodents demonstrate the efficacy of triterpenoids against carcinogenesis and other diseases including renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury and immune hepatitis. Genetic disruption of NRF2 abrogates protection by triterpenoids, suggesting that induction of the NRF2 pathway may drive this protection. Herein, we examined the effect of a point mutation (C151S) in KEAP1, a repressor of NRF2 signaling, at cysteine 151 in mouse embryo fibroblasts and mouse liver. Induction of target gene transcripts and enzyme activity by CDDO-Me was lost in C151S mutant fibroblasts compared to wild-type. Protection against menadione toxicity was also nullified in the mutant fibroblasts. In mouse liver, CDDO-Me evoked the nuclear translocation of NRF2 followed by increased transcript and activity levels of a prototypic target gene Nqo1 in wild-type, but not C151S mutant mice. To test the role of KEAP1 Cys151 in governing the broader pharmacodynamic action of CDDO-Me, wild-type and C151S mutant mice were challenged with concanavalin A to induce immune hepatitis. Strong protection was seen in wild-type but not C151S mutant mice. RNA-seq analysis of mouse liver from wild-type, C151S mutant and Nrf2-knockout mice revealed a vigorous response of the Nrf2 transcriptome in wild-type, but in neither C151S mutant nor Nrf2-knockout mice. Activation of \"off-target\" pathways by CDDO were not observed. These data highlight the singular importance of the KEAP1 cysteine 151 sensor for activation of NRF2 signaling by CDDO-Me. Significance Statement Keap1 serves as a key sensor for induction of the cytoprotective signaling pathway driven by the transcription factor NRF2. Mutation of a single cysteine (C151) in KEAP1 abrogates the induction of NRF2 signaling and its downstream cytoprotective actions in vitro and in vivo by bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), a drug in late-stage clinical development. Further, at these bioeffective concentrations/doses, activation of \"off-target\" pathways by CDDO-Me are not observed, highlighting the singular importance of NRF2 in its mode of action.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury is an important global health concern as it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Polyamines, essential for cell growth and proliferation, are known to inhibit cardiovascular disease. However, under conditions of cellular damage, toxic acrolein is produced from polyamines by the enzyme spermine oxidase (SMOX). We used a mouse renal ischemia-reperfusion model and human proximal tubule cells (HK-2) to investigate whether acrolein exacerbates acute kidney injury by renal tubular cell death. Acrolein visualized by acroleinRED was increased in ischemia-reperfusion kidneys, particularly in tubular cells. When HK-2 cells were cultured under 1% oxygen for 24 h, then switched to 21% oxygen for 24 h (hypoxia-reoxygenation), acrolein accumulated and SMOX mRNA and protein levels were increased. Acrolein induced cell death and fibrosis-related TGFB1 mRNA in HK-2 cells. Administration of the acrolein scavenger cysteamine suppressed the acrolein-induced upregulation of TGFB1 mRNA. Cysteamine also inhibited a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential observed by MitoTrackerCMXRos, and cell death induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of SMOX also suppressed hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced acrolein accumulation and cell death. Our study suggests that acrolein exacerbates acute kidney injury by promoting tubular cell death during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Treatment to control the accumulation of acrolein might be an effective therapeutic option for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Dexmedetomidine has been shown to protect against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Nevertheless, the precise mechanism is obscure. In order to explore the effect of dexmedetomidine pre-conditioning on autophagy against CIRI in rats, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was conducted to establish cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model in male SD rats with 2 h ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. Dexmedetomidine was delivered to rats at 10, 50 and 100 µg/kg doses respectively, and LY294002, a PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitor, was administered at 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally 30 min before MCAO. Neurological deficit score was assessed and cerebral infarct size was detected by TTC staining. Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to estimate spatial learning and memory ability. Furthermore, to detect activity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and autophagy, p-Akt, p-mTOR, Beclin-1 and LC3 were measured by western blot. Our findings revealed that 50 and 100 µg/kg of dexmedetomidine pretreatment could improve the neurological deficit score and reduce cerebral infarct size after CIRI, while these effects were markedly suppressed by LY294002. In MWM test, dexmedetomidine was confirmed to shorten escape latency and increase times across platform after CIRI. Nevertheless, LY294002 pretreatment eliminated the improvement of dexmedetomidine on spatial learning and memory ability. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine pretreatment reduced ratios of Beclin-1 and LC3II/LC3I and elevated p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR after CIRI. However, above effects of dexmedetomidine were partly reversed by LY294002. Overall, dexmedetomidine pretreatment exerted neuroprotection against CIRI in rats by attenuating autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is rapidly increasing nowadays and at a high risk to progress into chronic kidney disease (CKD). Of note, men are more susceptive to AKI, suggesting gender differences in AKI patients. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. To test it, we adopted two experimental models of AKI, including ischemia/reperfusion injury and rhabdomyolysis, which were constructed in age-matched male and female mice. We found severe damages of tubular apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and loss of renal function showing in male mice, while female mice only had very mild injury. We further tested the expression of Sirtuins, and found that female mice could preserve more Sirtuin members' expression in case of kidney damage. Among Sirtuin family, Sirtuin 6 was maximally preserved in injured kidney in female mice, suggesting its important role involved in the gender differences of AKI pathogenesis. We then found that knockdown of androgen receptor (AR) attenuated tubular damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and retarded the loss of renal function. Overexpression of Sirtuin 6 also showed similar results. Furthermore, in cultured tubular cells, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) decreased Sirtuin 6 expression and exacerbated cell apoptosis. Ectopic expression of Sirtuin 6 sufficiently inhibited DHT-induced cell apoptosis. Mechanically, we found AR inhibited Sirtuin 6, leading to the repression of binding of Sirtuin 6 with PGC-1α. This resulted in acetylation of PGC-1α and inhibition of its activity, further triggered the loss of mitochondrial homeostasis. Our results provided new insights to the underlying mechanisms of gender differences in AKI, suggesting Sirtuin 6 maybe a new therapeutic target for preventing AKI in male patients.\n",

However, all 13 mt-mRNAs could not display continuously up-regulated consistency at 0-15-30-60 min during WII. High throughput analysis of miRNA expression in both purified mitochondria and liver tissues suggested miR-23b-5p was a potential mitochondrial microRNA (mitomiR) biomarker with high sensitivity and 0-15-30-60 min change consistency. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization and RT-qPCR further confirmed the results. Through overexpression and inhibition, the functionality of this mitomiR during WII was identified as a protective regulator in vitro and then verified in Dicer1fl/flAlbCre mice by down-regulation of other miRNAs and supplementation of mature mitomiR-23b-5p. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and the Seahorse XF analyzer determined that mitomiR-23b-5p reduced mitochondrial respiratory function by silencing mtRNR2 (16S). Clinically, mitomiR-23b-5p was positively correlated with serum ALT levels 3 days after the operation (P=0.032), and the C-statistic for 90-day graft survival rate was 0.698.\n",

What is the main finding and its importance? Cardiomyocyte BH4 has a physiological role in cardiac metabolism. There was a shift of substrate preference from fatty acid to glucose in hearts with targeted deletion of BH4 synthesis. The changes in fatty-acid metabolic profile were associated with a protective effect in response to ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, and reduced infarct size. Manipulating fatty acid metabolism via BH4 availability could play a therapeutic role in limiting IR injury.\n",

      "Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is an essential cofactor for nitric oxide (NO) synthases in which its production of NO is crucial for cardiac function. However, non-canonical roles of BH4 have been discovered recently and the cell-specific role of cardiomyocyte BH4 in cardiac function and metabolism remains to be elucidated. Therefore, we developed a novel mouse model of cardiomyocyte BH4 deficiency, by cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Gch1, which encodes guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I, a required enzyme for de novo BH4 synthesis. Cardiomyocyte (cm)Gch1 mRNA expression and BH4 levels from cmGch1 KO mice were significantly reduced compared to Gch1flox/flox (WT) littermates. Transcriptomic analyses and protein assays revealed downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in cmGch1 KO hearts compared with WT, accompanied by increased triacylglycerol concentration within the myocardium. Deletion of cardiomyocyte BH4 did not alter basal cardiac function. However, the recovery of left ventricle function was improved in cmGch1 KO hearts when subjected to ex vivo ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, with reduced infarct size compared to WT hearts. Metabolomic analyses of cardiac tissue after IR revealed that long-chain fatty acids were increased in cmGch1 KO hearts compared to WT, whereas at 5 min reperfusion (post-35 min ischaemia) fatty acid metabolite levels were higher in WT compared to cmGch1 KO hearts. These results indicate a new role for BH4 in cardiomyocyte fatty acid metabolism, such that reduction of cardiomyocyte BH4 confers a protective effect in response to cardiac IR injury. Manipulating cardiac metabolism via BH4 could play a therapeutic role in limiting IR injury.\n",

      "The acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden cardiac death (SCD), both associated with acute cardiac ischemia, are one of the leading causes of adult death in economically developed countries. The development of new approaches for the treatment and prevention of AMI and SCD remains the highest priority for medicine. A study on the cardiovascular effects of chronic hypoxia (CH) may contribute to the development of these methods. Chronic hypoxia exerts both positive and adverse effects. The positive effects are the infarct-reducing, vasoprotective, and antiarrhythmic effects, which can lead to the improvement of cardiac contractility in reperfusion. The adverse effects are pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. This review presents a comprehensive overview of how CH enhances cardiac tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion. It is an in-depth analysis of the published data on the underlying mechanisms, which can lead to future development of the cardioprotective effect of CH.

      "Cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury could emanate a cascade of events ensuing in neural death and severe neurobehavioural deficits. The currently available interventions have failed to target the multimodal, interlinked mechanisms that operate cerebral ischemia-induced damage and functional loss. So an integrative intervention has become a mandate to overcome the deleterious mechanisms involved in cerebral ischemic pathophysiology. In this study, adult male Sprague dawley rats were exposed to 2 hours of right middle cerebral artery occlusion (rMCAo) followed by reperfusion, and the intervention group received Fucoidan alone at a dose of 50mg/kg, i.p (intraperitoneal), Cerebrolysin alone at a dose of 2.5mg/kg body weight and the combination of both. The sham rats were exposed to surgical procedures, except for the rMCAo. The assessments of the groups were made 24 hours after the rMCAo. The stand-alone treatment with Fucoidan, Cerebrolysin has shown a better outcome in the neurobehavioral and, histopathological assessments and the combination has made a significant reduction in the neurological deficits and the infarct volume when compared to the standalone groups. The BBB integrity was well preserved in the combination group when compared with the lesion and standalone groups. Moreover, the combined intervention reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, NFkB, IL1α, IL1-β, IL-6, CD68, COX-2, and mRNA expression of inflammatory genes IL1α, IL1-β, IL-6, IBA-1, and COX-2 effectively. In conclusion, the present study suggests that rMCAo induced neuroinflammation and neurobehavioural alterations were attenuated by intervention with a combination of Fucoidan and cerebrolysin; Further, Fucoidan and Cerebrolysin combination improved the ischemic tolerance level by promoting the proteins and genes that regulate the inflammatory cytokines and in aiding better recovery after ischemic reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been the focus of cellular therapy studies. The use of iPSCs in regenerative medicine is limited by their tumorigenic potential. This study sought to determine whether iPSCs-derived podocytes attenuate acute kidney injury (AKI) and the molecular mechanism. Inoculation of iPSCs-podocytes significantly promoted the repair of kidney injury in AKI mice, reduced the levels of kidney injury factors Scr, BUN, and urinary NAG, and alleviated the inflammatory response. Histological analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of M2 macrophages and a significant decrease in M1 macrophages in the kidney tissues. Subsequently, the genes and signaling pathways that may be associated with kidney injury repair in mice were analyzed by RNA-seq and bioinformatics prediction. The polarization of M2 macrophages was promoted by MAF bZIP transcription factor B (Mafb)-mediated activation of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (Ccr5) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) signaling pathway. Taken together, these results show that iPSCs-podocytes depend on Mafb to activate the Nampt signaling pathway through transcriptional activation of Ccr5, thereby promoting the repair of AKI caused by ischemia-reperfusion.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious disease with no effective treatment. Abnormal opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) is an important pathological process in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), the key factor of AKI. It is essential to elucidate MPTP regulation mechanism. Here, we identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L7/L12 (MRPL12) specifically binds to adenosine nucleotide translocase 3 (ANT3) under normal physiological conditions, stabilizes MPTP and maintains mitochondrial membrane homeostasis in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs). During AKI, MRPL12 expression was significantly decreased in TECs, and MRPL12-ANT3 interaction was reduced, leading to ANT3 conformation change, MPTP abnormal opening, and cell apoptosis. Importantly, MRPL12 overexpression protected TECs from MPTP abnormal opening and apoptosis during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). Our results suggest MRPL12-ANT3 axis involves in AKI by regulating MPTP, and MRPL12 could be potential intervention target for treatment of AKI.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury to the lower extremities causes damage to various tissues, notably the limbs. Because research in recent years have demonstrated that saffron and its components are useful in ischemic strokes, the goal of this study was to see whether Crocin (Cr), one of the active constituents in saffron, could protect the gastrocnemius muscle from IR injury. A total number of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups randomly: control, Cr, IR, and IR + Cr. Xylazine and ketamine were used to anesthetize all of the rats. The left lower limbs of the other two groups were subjected to 2 hr of ischemia and 2 hr of reperfusion with tourniquet, with the exception of the control and Cr groups. Tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels were assessed in the blood as well as muscle IL-6, IL1β, SOD1-2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression. According to the IR group, increases in TAS levels and decreases in TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β levels were substantial in the Cr therapy group. Cr significantly reduced IL-6 and IL-1β mRNA expression levels in the muscle of the IR group and increased superoxide dismutases 1 (SOD1), SOD2, catalase (CAT), and GPx. Our data showed that Cr protected the gastrocnemius muscle from IR injury in rats and reduced inflammatory markers significantly. These effects of Cr might have been mediated by improved antioxidant enzyme activity, suppression of free radical generation and reduction of oxidative stress.\n",

      "Ischemic stroke is a disease with worldwide economic and social negative effects. It is a serious disease with high disability and mortality. Ionic imbalance, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation are induced during and after ischemic stroke. Cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, and necrosis are activated directly or indirectly mechanisms. The studies about neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases have increased in recent years. Data about the mechanisms of progressive molecular improvement in the brain tissue are increasing in acute ischemic stroke. Based on these data, preclinical and clinical studies on new neuroprotective treatments are being designed. An effective neuroprotective strategy can prolong the indication period of recanalization treatments in the acute stage of ischemic stroke. In addition, it can reduce neuronal necrosis and protect the brain against ischemia-related reperfusion injury. The current review has evaluated the recent clinical and experimental studies. The molecular mechanism of each of the neuroprotective strategies is also summarized. This review may help develop future strategies for combination treatment to protect the cerebral tissue from ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and clinically devastating disease that causes respiratory failure. Morbidity and mortality of patients in intensive care units are stubbornly high, and various complications severely affect the quality of life of survivors. The pathophysiology of ARDS includes increased alveolar-capillary membrane permeability, an influx of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid, and surfactant dysfunction leading to severe hypoxemia. At present, the main treatment for ARDS is mechanical treatment combined with diuretics to reduce pulmonary edema, which primarily improves symptoms, but the prognosis of patients with ARDS is still very poor. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal cells that possess the capacity to self-renew and also exhibit multilineage differentiation. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as the umbilical cord, endometrial polyps, menstrual blood, bone marrow, and adipose tissues. Studies have confirmed the critical healing and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Recently, the potential of stem cells in treating ARDS has been explored via basic research and clinical trials. The efficacy of MSCs has been shown in a variety of in vivo models of ARDS, reducing bacterial pneumonia and ischemia-reperfusion injury while promoting the repair of ventilator-induced lung injury. This article reviews the current basic research findings and clinical applications of MSCs in the treatment of ARDS in order to emphasize the clinical prospects of MSCs.\n",

      "The present study aimed to explore the cardioprotective effects of Rhodiola wallichiana var.cholaensis (RW) against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced H9c2 cell injury and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced myocardial injury. Following treatment with RW, H9c2 cells were subjected to 4 h of hypoxia/3 h of reoxygenation. MTT assay, LDH assay, and flow cytometry were employed to detect cell viability and changes of ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, after RW treatment, rats underwent 30 min of ischemia, followed by 120 min of reperfusion. Masson and TUNEL staining were performed to measure myocardial damage and apoptosis, respectively. The changes in the levels of proteins were detected by ELISA and western blot. The results showed that RW attenuated the H/R-induced increase in LDH release and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as the apoptosis in H9c2 cells. Meanwhile, RW significantly reduces the ST-segment elevation and improves cardiomyocytes' injury, inhibit the apoptosis induced by I/R in rats. Furthermore, RW could decrease the levels of MDA and increase the levels of SOD, T-AOC. GSH-Px and GSH both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, RW increased the expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, ARE and NQO1, and decreased the expressions of Keap1, activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggested that RW exerts cardioprotection on H/R injury in H9c2 cells and I/R injury in rats by attenuating oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis via enhancing Nrf2 signaling.\n",

However, the I/R group showed hippocampal structure disorders, interstitial edema, deep nuclear staining, karyopyknosis, and karyorrhexis in brain tissues. The study results further revealed that TIMP2 could aggravate the pathological damage of brain tissues in the I/R+TIMP2 group compared with the I/R group and significantly reduced it in the TIMP2-KD group. Furthermore, the Western blotting results demonstrated that the protein expression levels of TIMP2, p-ERK1/2, t-ERK1/2, NLRP3, IL-1β, IL-18, GSDMD, Caspase-1, and ASC in brain tissues and hippocampal neurons were significantly higher in the experimental groups than those in the control group. The I/R+TIMP2 group displaying the highest increase and the TIMP2-KD group showing a significant decrease. In conclusion, TIMP2 can contribute to the occurrence and progression of CIRI by activating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis.\n",

      "Evidence suggests that the microRNA-181 (miR-181) family performs various roles in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury (CIRI). MiR-181a has been identified as a critical determinant of neuronal survival. Moreover, the significance of miR-181a in controlling neuronal death after CIRI has received little attention. The objective of this study was to assess the role of miR-181a in neuronal cell injury after CIRI. To mimic the in-vitro and in-vivo CIRI, we developed an oxygen-glucose deficiency/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model in SH-SY5Y cells and a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats. MiR-181a expression was significantly higher in both in-vivo and in-vitro CIRI models. The overexpression of miR-181a increased cell damage and oxidative stress caused by OGD/R, whereas inhibition of miR-181a reduced both. PTEN has also been found to be a direct miR-181a target. PTEN overexpression reduced cell apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by miR-181a upregulation under an OGD/R condition. Furthermore, we found that the rs322931 A allele was related to increased miR-181a levels in IS peripheral blood and higher susceptibility to IS. The current results offer new insights into the understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of CIRI, as well as possible new treatment candidates.\n",

      "The use of high-risk renal grafts for transplantation requires the optimization of pretransplant assessment and preservation reconditioning strategies to decrease the organ discard rate and to improve short- and long-term clinical outcomes. Active oxygenation is increasingly recognized to play a central role in dynamic preservation strategies, independent of preservation temperature, to recondition mitochondria and to restore the cellular energy profile. The oxygen-related decrease in mitochondrial succinate accumulation ameliorates the harmful effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury. The differences between normothermic and hypothermic machine perfusion with regard to organ assessment, preservation, and reconditioning, as well as the logistic and economic implications, are factors to take into consideration for implementation at a local level. Therefore, these different techniques should be considered complementary to the perfusion strategy selected depending on functional intention and resource availability. This review provides an overview of the current clinical evidence of normothermic and oxygenated hypothermic machine perfusion, either as a continuous or end-ischemic preservation strategy, and future perspectives.\n",

      "Warm ischemia-reperfusion injury is a prognostic factor for hepatectomy and liver transplantation. However, its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. This study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms and identify the predictive markers of post-reperfusion injury. Rats with normal livers were subjected to 70% hepatic warm ischemia for 15, 30, or 90 min, while those with steatotic livers were subjected to 70% hepatic warm ischemia for only 30 min. The liver and blood were sampled at the end of ischemia and 1, 6, and 24 h after reperfusion. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, Suzuki injury scores, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) products were evaluated. The ALT activity and Suzuki scores increased with ischemic duration and peaked at 1 and 6 h after reperfusion, respectively. Steatotic livers subjected to 30 min ischemia and normal livers subjected to 90 min ischemia showed comparable injury. A similar trend was observed for LPO products. Imaging mass spectrometry of normal livers revealed an increase in lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI (18:0)) and a concomitant decrease in phosphatidylinositol (PI (18:0/20:4)) in Zone 1 (central venous region) with increasing ischemic duration; they returned to their basal values after reperfusion. Similar changes were observed in steatotic livers. Hepatic warm ischemia time-dependent acceleration of PI (18:0/20:4) to LPI (18:0) conversion occurs initially in Zone 1 and is more pronounced in fatty livers. Thus, the LPI (18:0)/PI (18:0/20:4) ratio is a potential predictor of post-reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a global health problem and has recently been recognized as a risk factor for developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments to reduce or prevent AKI, which results in high morbidity and mortality rates. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has emerged as a promising strategy to prevent, to the extent possible, renal tissue from AKI. Several studies have used this strategy, which involves short or long cycles of ischemia/reperfusion (IR) prior to a potential fatal ischemic injury. In most of these studies, IPC was effective at reducing renal damage. Since the first study that showed renoprotection due to IPC, several studies have focused on finding the best strategy to activate correctly and efficiently reparative mechanisms, generating different modalities with promising results. In addition, the studies performing remote IPC, by inducing an ischemic process in distant tissues before a renal IR, are also addressed. Here, we review in detail existing studies on IPC strategies for AKI pathophysiology and the proposed triggering mechanisms that have a positive impact on renal function and structure in animal models of AKI and in humans, as well as the prospects and challenges for its clinical application.\n",

      "Transient cerebral ischemia induces neuronal degeneration, followed in time by secondary delayed neuronal death that is strongly correlated with a permanent inhibition of protein synthesis in vulnerable brain regions, while protein translational rates are recovered in resistant areas. In the translation-regulation initiation step, the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E is a key player regulated by its association with eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), mostly 4E-BP2 in brain tissue. In a previous work, we identified dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP2) as a 4E-BP2-interacting protein. Here, using a proteomic approach in a model of transient cerebral ischemia, a detailed study of DRP2 was performed in order to address the challenge of translation restoration in vulnerable regions. In this report, several DRP2 isoforms that have a specific interaction with both 4E-BP2 and eIF4E were identified, showing significant and opposite differences in this association, and being differentially detected in resistant and vulnerable regions in response to ischemia reperfusion. Our results provide the first evidence of DRP2 isoforms as potential regulators of the 4E-BP2-eIF4E association that would have consequences in the delayed neuronal death under ischemic-reperfusion stress. The new knowledge reported here identifies DRP2 as a new target to promote neuronal survival after cerebral ischemia.\n",

      "The mechanisms of hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs during liver transplantation or surgery, are poorly understood. The purpose of the current study was to generate and characterize a HepG2 cell line with a stable overexpression of CYP2E1 to investigate the role of the enzyme in hypoxia/reperfusion (H/R) injury in an ex vivo setting. GFP-tagged CYP2E1 and control clones were developed, and their gene expression and protein levels of GFP and CYP2E1 were determined using RT-PCR and ELISA/Western blot analysis, respectively. Additionally, the CYP2E1 catalytic activity was determined by UPLC-MS/MS analysis of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone formed from the chlorzoxazone substrate. The CYP2E1 and control clones were subjected to hypoxia (10 h) and reoxygenation (0.5 h), and cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were quantitated using LDH and flow cytometry, respectively. Compared with the control clone, the selected CYP2E1 clone showed a 720-fold increase in CYP2E1 expression and a prominent band in the western blot analysis, which was associated with a 150-fold increase in CYP2E1 catalytic activity. The CYP2E1 clone produced 2.3-fold more ROS and 1.9-fold more cell death in the H/R model. It is concluded that the constitutive CYP2E1 in the liver may play a detrimental role in hepatic I/R injury.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a frequent cause of AKI, resulting in vasoconstriction, cellular dysfunction, inflammation and the induction of oxidative stress. DNA damage, including physical DNA strand breaks, is also a potential consequence of renal IRI. The histone H2A variants, primary H2AX and H2AZ participate in DNA damage response pathways to promote genome stability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical pattern of histone H2A variants' (H2AX, γH2AX(S139), H2AXY142ph and H2AZ) expression in an experimental model of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Comparing the immunohistochemical nuclear expression of γH2AX(S139) and H2AXY142ph in AKI, we observed that there is an inverse ratio of these two histone H2AX variants. If we follow different regions from the subcapsular structures to the medulla, there is an increasing extent gradient in the nuclear expression of H2AXY142ph, accompanied by a decreasing nuclear expression of γH2AX. In addition, we observed that different structures dominated when γH2AX and H2AXY142ph expression levels were compared. γH2AX was expressed only in the proximal tubule, with the exception of when they were dilated. In the medulla, H2AXY142ph is predominantly expressed in the loop of Henle and the collecting ducts. Our results show moderate sporadic nuclear H2AZ expression mainly in the cells of the distal tubules and the collecting ducts that were surrounded by dilated tubules with PAS (periodic acid-Schiff stain)-positive casts. These findings may indicate the degree of DNA damage, followed by postischemic AKI, with potential clinical and prognostic implications regarding this condition.\n",

      "We previously showed that SerpinA3K is present in urine from rats and humans with acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the specific role of SerpinA3K during renal pathophysiology is unknown. To begin to understand the role of SerpinA3K on AKI, SerpinA3K-deficient (KOSA3) mice were studied 24 h after inducing ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and compared to wild type (WT) mice. Four groups were studied: WT+S, WT+IR, KOSA3+S, and KOSA3+IR. As expected, I/R increased serum creatinine and BUN, with a GFR reduction in both genotypes; however, renal dysfunction was ameliorated in the KOSA3+IR group. Interestingly, the increase in UH2O2 induced by I/R was not equally seen in the KOSA3+IR group, an effect that was associated with the preservation of antioxidant enzymes' mRNA levels. Additionally, FOXO3 expression was initially greater in the KOSA3 than in the WT group. Moreover, the increase in BAX protein level and the decrease in Hif1a and Vegfa induced by I/R were not observed in the KOSA3+IR group, suggesting that these animals have better cellular responses to hypoxic injury. Our findings suggest that SerpinA3K is involved in the renal oxidant response, HIF1α/VEGF pathway, and cell apoptosis.\n",

      "The autofluorescence of specific fatty acids, retinoids, and bilirubin in crude serum can reflect changes in liver functional engagement in maintaining systemic metabolic homeostasis. The role of these fluorophores as intrinsic biomarkers of pharmacological actions has been investigated here in rats administered with obeticholic acid (OCA), a Farnesoid-X Receptor (FXR) agonist, proven to counteract the increase of serum bilirubin in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been applied to an assay serum collected from rats submitted to liver I/R (60/60 min ± OCA administration). The I/R group showed changes in the amplitude and profiles of emission spectra excited at 310 or 366 nm, indicating remarkable alterations in the retinoid and fluorescing fatty acid balance, with a particular increase in arachidonic acid. The I/R group also showed an increase in bilirubin AF, detected in the excitation spectra recorded at 570 nm. OCA greatly reversed the effects observed in the I/R group, confirmed by the biochemical analysis of bilirubin and fatty acids. These results are consistent with a relationship between OCA anti-inflammatory effects and the acknowledged roles of fatty acids as precursors of signaling agents mediating damaging responses to harmful stimuli, supporting serum autofluorescence analysis as a possible direct, real-time, cost-effective tool for pharmacological investigations.\n",

      "Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) is a metabolite of curcumin (CUR). It shares many of CUR's beneficial biological activities in addition to being more water-soluble, chemically stable, and bioavailable compared to CUR. However, its mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. This paper addresses the preventive role of THC on various brain dysfunctions as well as its effects on brain redox processes, traumatic brain injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease in various animal or cell culture models. In addition to its strong antioxidant properties, the effects of THC on the reduction of amyloid β aggregates are also well documented. The therapeutic potential of THC to treat patterns of mitochondrial brain dysmorphic dysfunction is also addressed and thoroughly reviewed, as is evidence from experimental studies about the mechanism of mitochondrial failure during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. THC treatment also results in a dose-dependent decrease in ERK-mediated phosphorylation of GRASP65, which prevents further compartmentalization of the Golgi apparatus. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is possibly the most involved mechanism in the anti-apoptotic effect of THC. Overall, studies in various animal models of different brain disorders suggest that THC can be used as a dietary supplement to protect against traumatic brain injury and even improve brain function in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We suggest further preclinical studies be conducted to demonstrate the brain-protective, anti-amyloid, and anti-Parkinson effects of THC. Application of the methods used in the currently reviewed studies would be useful and should help define doses and methods of THC administration in different disease conditions.\n",

      "Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is one of the key effectors of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), ATF4/CHOP pathway-mediated ERS plays an important role in the progression of acute kidney disease (AKI). We have previously reported that Vitamin D receptor (VDR) exert renoprotection in rodent AKI models. However, whether ATF4, as well as ERS, is involved in the protective effect of VDR in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced AKI is unknown. Herein, we showed that VDR agonist paricalcitol and VDR overexpression alleviated I/R-induced renal injury and cells apoptosis with decreased ATF4 and attenuated ERS, while VDR deletion significantly resulted in further increased ATF4, more drastic ERS and renal injury in I/R mice models. In addition, paricalcitol remarkably reduced Tunicamycin (TM) induced ATF4 and ERS with attenuated renal injury, while VDR deletion aggravated the above changes in TM mice models. Moreover, overexpression of ATF4 partially abolished the effect of paricalcitol against TM-induced ERS and apoptosis, while inhibition of ATF4 enhanced the protective effect of paricalcitol. Bioinformatics analysis indicated potential VDR binding sites on ATF4 promotor sequence which were further confirmed by ChIP-qPCR and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. In conclusion, VDR attenuated I/R-induced AKI by suppressing ERS partly via transcriptional regulation of ATF4.\n",

      "Diabetic patients are prone to acute myocardial infarction. Although reperfusion therapy can preserve the viability of the myocardium, it also causes fatal ischemia‒reperfusion injury. Diabetes can exacerbate myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion injury, but the mechanism is unclear. We aimed to characterize the effects of liraglutide on the prevention of ischemia‒reperfusion injury and inadequate autophagy. Liraglutide reduced the myocardial infarction area and improved cardiac function in diabetic mice. We further demonstrated that liraglutide mediated these protective effects by activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy. Liraglutide markedly increased p-AMPK levels and the LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and reduced p-mTOR levels and p62 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR increased cell viability and autophagy levels in high glucose and H/R-treated H9C2 cells. Overall, our study reveals that liraglutide acts upstream of the AMPK/mTOR pathway to effectively counteract high glucose- and H/R-induced cell dysfunction by activating AMPK/mTOR-dependent autophagy, providing a basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of ischemia‒reperfusion in diabetes.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury induces endothelial glycocalyx (GCX) degradation. Several candidate GCX-protective factors including albumin have been identified, few have been demonstrated in in vivo studies and most albumins used to date have been heterologous. Albumin is a carrier protein for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which has protective effects on the cardiovascular system. However, changes inhibited by albumin in the endothelial GCX structure in I/R in vivo via the S1P receptor has not been reported. In this study, we aimed to determine whether albumin prevents the shedding of endothelial GCX in response to I/R in vivo. Rats were divided into four groups: control (CON), I/R, I/R with albumin preload (I/R + ALB), and I/R + ALB with S1P receptor agonist fingolimod (I/R + ALB + FIN). FIN acts as an initial agonist of S1P receptor 1 and downregulates the receptor in an inhibitory manner. The CON and I/R groups received saline and I/R + ALB and I/R + ALB + FIN groups received albumin solution before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. Our study used rat albumin. Shedding of endothelial GCX was evaluated in the myocardium by electron microscopy, and the concentration of serum syndecan-1 was measured. Thus, albumin administration maintained the structure of endothelial GCX and prevented shedding of endothelial GCX via the S1P receptor in myocardial I/R, and FIN annihilated the protective effect of albumin against I/R injury.\n",

      "BRG1 is a key factor in the process of apoptosis and oxidative damage; however, its role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke is unclear. Here, we discovered that during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) reperfusion in mice, microglia were significantly activated in the cerebral cortex of the infarct area, and BRG1 expression was increased in the mouse MCAO/R model, peaking at 4 days. In microglia subjected to OGD/R, BRG1 expression increased and peaked at 12 h after reoxygenation. After ischemic stroke, in vitro changing the expression of BRG1 expression levels greatly altered the activation of microglia and the production of antioxidant and pro-oxidant proteins. Knocking down BRG1 expression levels in vitro increased the inflammatory response, promoted microglial activation, and decreased the expression of the NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway after ischemic stroke. In contrast, overexpression of BRG1 dramatically reduced the expression of NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway and microglial activation. Our research reveals that BRG1 reduces postischemic oxidative damage via the KEAP1-NRF2/HO-1 signaling pathway, protecting against brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. Using BRG1 as a pharmaceutical target to inhibit inflammatory responses to reduce oxidative damage may be a unique way to explore techniques for the treatment of ischemic stroke and other cerebrovascular illnesses.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a key reason for the poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. As only a few neuroprotective medications for cerebral I/R injury have been applied in the clinic, it is necessary to design a new therapeutic strategy to treat cerebral I/R injury. The N-salicyloyl tryptamine derivative LZWL02003, synthesized from melatonin and salicylic acid, exhibits a wide range of biological properties. In this study, we assessed the neuroprotective capabilities of LZWL02003 in vivo and in vitro and investigated its possible mechanisms. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation was utilized to create an in vitro model of cerebral I/R damage. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion was employed to imitate cerebral I/R injury in vivo. Neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation are associated with the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury. Our findings demonstrated that LZWL02003 upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Bax, thus maintaining the homeostasis of Bcl-2/Bax proteins and preventing apoptosis. LZWL02003 also reduced oxidative stress by reducing malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species levels, increasing the superoxide dismutase activity, and resolving mitochondrial malfunction. LZWL02003 can lower interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 levels, which in turn suppress neuroinflammation. Activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway is involved in various pathophysiologies, including cerebral I/R injury. We discovered that LZWL02003 suppressed the phosphorylation activation of NF-κB pathway-related proteins and decreased the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 subunits. Taken together, our results suggest that LZWL02003 is a neuroprotective drug with pleiotropic effects and may be a candidate for treating cerebral I/R injury.\n",

      "Homogeneity and heterogeneity of the cytopathological mechanisms in different etiology-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) are poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell sequencing (scRNA) on mouse kidneys with five common AKI etiologies (CP-Cisplatin, IRI-Ischemia-reperfusion injury, UUO-Unilateral ureteral obstruction, FA-Folic acid, and SO-Sodium oxalate). We constructed a potent multi-model AKI scRNA atlas containing 20 celltypes with 80,689 high-quality cells. The data suggest that compared to IRI and CP-AKI, FA- and SO-AKI exhibit injury characteristics more similar to UUO-AKI, which may due to tiny crystal-induced intrarenal obstruction. Through scRNA atlas, 7 different functional proximal tubular cell (PTC) subtypes were identified, we found that Maladaptive PTCs and classical Havcr1 PTCs but not novel Krt20 PTCs affect the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic levels in different AKI models. And cell death and cytoskeletal remodeling events are widespread patterns of injury in PTCs. Moreover, we found that programmed cell death predominated in PTCs, whereas apoptosis and autophagy prevailed in the remaining renal tubules. We also identified S100a6 as a novel AKI-endothelial injury biomarker. Furthermore, we revealed that the dynamic and active immune (especially Arg1 Macro_2 cells) -parenchymal cell interactions are important features of AKI. Taken together, our study provides a potent resource for understanding the pathogenesis of AKI and early intervention in AKI progression at single-cell resolution.\n",

      "Sperm associated antigen 6 (Spag6) is the PF16 homolog of Chlamydomonas and participates in the regulation of cilia movement. Studies have shown that Spag6 is expressed in the brain, and its loss will lead to cerebral edema caused by a defect in motor cilium function in ependymal cells. However, it has not been reported whether the limited or extensive cerebral edema resulting from ischemic strokes is related to the expression regulation of Spag6. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and related mechanism of Spag6 in alleviating Cerebral Ischemic stroke-reperfusion (CIS/R) damage. Our experimental results showed that Spag6 overexpression alleviated CIS/R-mediated motor cilia structural disorder, improved cerebral edema, inhibited nerve injuries in rats with cerebral ischemia, and alleviated synaptic and dendritic spinal injuries by regulating the expressions of synaptic-related proteins such as CaMKII, PSD95, and CREB. Based on significant changes in PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway activity after CIS/R determination, we determined that Spag6 regulates the abnormal expression of CIS/R-induced inflammatory factors NF-κB, NLRP3, IL-10, and the autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1, LC3, and P62 by activating the PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. This inhibits inflammation and autophagy in the brain tissue. In summary, this study revealed that Spag6 alleviates brain edema damage after CIS/R by maintaining the structural function of the motor cilium, regulating the PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, and inhibiting inflammation and autophagy reaction.\n",

To decipher the dynamic process of AKI caused by IRI (with prolonged ischemia phase), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of clinically relevant IRI murine model with different ischemic intervals. We discovered that Slc5a2hi proximal tubular cells were susceptible to AKI and highly expressed neutral amino acid transporter gene Slc6a19, which was dramatically decreased over the time course. With the usage of mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis, we detected that the level of neutral amino acid isoleucine dropped off in AKI mouse plasma metabolites. And the reduction of plasma isoleucine was also verified in patients with cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI). The findings advanced the understanding of dynamic process of AKI and introduced reduction of isoleucine as a potential biomarker for CSA-AKI.\n",

      "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. After heart injury triggered by myocardial ischemia or myocardial infarction, extensive zones of tissue are damaged and some of the tissue dies by necrosis and/or apoptosis. The loss of contractile mass activates a series of biochemical mechanisms that allow, through cardiac remodeling, the replacement of the dysfunctional heart tissue by fibrotic material. Our previous studies have shown that primary cilia, non-motile antenna-like structures at the cell surface required for the activation of specific signaling pathways, are present in cardiac fibroblasts and required for cardiac fibrosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in mice. I/R-induced myocardial fibrosis promotes the enrichment of ciliated cardiac fibroblasts where the myocardial injury occurs. Given discussions about the existence of cilia in specific cardiac cell types, as well as the functional relevance of studying cilia-dependent signaling in cardiac fibrosis after I/R, here we describe our methods to evaluate the presence and roles of primary cilia in cardiac fibrosis after I/R in mice.\n",

      "Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are a cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). Our knowledge of these DAMPs remains incomplete. Here, we report serum peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) as a novel DAMP for AKI. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and kidney ischemia/reperfusion injury instigated AKI with concurrent increases in serum Prdx1 and reductions of Prdx1 expression in kidney tubular epithelial cells. Genetic knockout of Prdx1 or use of a Prdx1-neutralizing antibody protected mice from AKI and this protection was impaired by introduction of recombinant Prdx1 (rPrdx1). Mechanistically, lipopolysaccharide increased serum and kidney proinflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration, and the content of M1 macrophages. All these events were suppressed in Prdx1-/- mice and renewed upon introduction of rPrdx1. In primary peritoneal macrophages, rPrdx1 induced M1 polarization, activated macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) signaling, and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine production. Prdx1 interacted with Mincle to initiate acute kidney inflammation. Of note, rPrdx1 upregulated Mincle and the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk system in the primary peritoneal macrophages, while knockdown of Mincle abolished the increase in activated Syk. Additionally, rPrdx1 treatment enhanced the downstream events of Syk, including transcription factor NF-κB signaling pathways. Furthermore, serum Prdx1 was found to be increased in patients with AKI; the increase of which was associated with kidney function decline and inflammatory biomarkers in patient serum. Thus, kidney-derived serum Prdx1 contributes to AKI at least in part by activating Mincle signaling and downstream pathways.\n",

Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a common anesthetic and sedative drug, can considerably boost glutathione (GSH), which has anti-copper influx effects. Focusing on cuproptosis, the mechanism of DEX in the I/R was revealed. Using the I/R rat model, the effects of DEX and the copper chelator D-penicillamine on cerebral infarct volume, copper levels, mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential, GSH content, and enrichment of cuproptosis functional proteins were examined. The involvement of ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) in the DEX regulatory pathway was verified by overexpressing FDX1 in vitro. DEX could significantly reduce cerebral infarction in rats, reduce copper levels, maintain mitochondrial functions, increase GSH, and reduce the content of key proteins related to cuproptosis. These aspects were replicated in vitro and revealed that FDX1 overexpression partially reversed the impacts of DEX. Together, cuproptosis occurs in the brain I/R process and DEX can enhance cell survival by blocking the primary pathway mediated by FDX1.KEY MESSAGESDexmedetomidine reduces cerebral infarction in the I/R rat models.Dexmedetomidine reduces cuproptosis in the I/R rat models.FDX1, an upstream of protein fatty acylation, mediates regulation of Dexmedetomidine.\n",

      "It has been confirmed that BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1) are involved in ferroptosis related diseases. However, the function of BACH1 in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) induced ferroptosis remains to be largely unrevealed. Firstly, analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CIRI based on the GEO dataset GSE119121 revealed that BACH1 was upregulated in CIRI. BACH1 level was prominently increased in MCAO/reperfusion model and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) cell model. Further, knock-down of BACH1 markedly reduced iron ion concentration, ROS production, 4-HNE and lipid peroxidation levels, and facilitated GSH content, cell viability, and protein levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11, while an pcDNA-KDM4C or pcDNA-COX2 combined with BACH1 siRNA could not enhance this effect. Mechanistically, BACH1 bound on the KDM4C promoter to transcriptionally activate its expression. Besides, KDM4C could occupy the promoter locus of the COX2 gene, promoting the COX2 expression by eliminating H3K9me3. Overexpression of KDM4C or COX2 overturned the effects of BACH1 inhibition. In vivo findings displayed that brain infraction, pathological damage, and neuronal loss rate in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice were conspicuously decreased after BACH1 knock-down. This study reveals that BACH1 encourages ferroptosis in neuroblastoma cells and CIRI mouse brain tissues by activating KDM4C-mediated COX2 demethylation.\n",

Our study aims to investigate the potential involvement of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and autophagy in renoprotection generated by I-PostC. A rat model of LIR-induced AKI was established and rats were randomly assigned to five groups: (i) sham-operated control, (ii) I/R, (iii) I/R + I-PostC, (iv) I/R + I-PostC + rapamycin (autophagy activator), and (v) I/R + I-PostC + 3-methyladenine (autophagy inhibitor). Morphological changes in the kidneys were assessed by histology, and ultrastructural changes in renal tubular epithelial cells and glomerular podocytes were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of kidney function parameters, serum inflammatory factors, and autophagy markers were detected. The results showed that the levels of HMGB1, Beclin1, LC3-II/LC3-I, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) were significantly higher in the I/R group compared to the sham control in serum and in renal tissues. I-PostC significantly reduced the levels of HMGB1, Beclin1, LC3-II/LC3-I, and inflammatory cytokines in renal tissues and improved renal function. Renal histopathology and ultrastructural observations indicated that I-PostC alleviated renal tissue injury. In addition, rapamycin (autophagy activator) treatment increased the levels of inflammatory cytokine expression levels and decreased renal function, reversed the protective effect of I-PostC against LIR-induced AKI. In conclusion, I-PostC could play a protective role against AKI by regulating the release of HMGB1 and inhibiting autophagy activation.\n",

      "Preparation of the ionic liquid (IL) form of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), termed API-IL, has attracted attention because it can improve upon certain disadvantages of APIs, such as poor water solubility and low stability. Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one) is a clinically approved cerebroprotective agent against ischemic stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while new formulations that enable improvement of its physicochemical properties and biodistribution are desired. Herein, we report a newly developed API-IL of edaravone (edaravone-IL), in which edaravone is used as an anionic molecule. We investigated the physicochemical properties of edaravone-IL and its therapeutic effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a secondary injury after an ischemic stroke. Among the cationic molecules used for edaravone-IL preparation, the IL prepared with tetrabutylphosphonium cation existed as a liquid at room temperature, and significantly increased the water solubility of edaravone without decreasing its antioxidative activity. Importantly, edaravone-IL formed negatively charged nanoparticles upon suspension in water. Intravenous administration of edaravone-IL showed significantly higher blood circulation time and lower distribution in the kidney compared with edaravone solution. Moreover, edaravone-IL significantly suppressed brain cell damage and motor functional deficits in model rats of cerebral I/R injury and showed comparable cerebroprotective effect to edaravone. Taken together, these results suggest that edaravone-IL could be a new form of edaravone with superior physicochemical properties and could be useful for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury.\n",

      "Intestinal ischemia underlies several clinical conditions and can result in the loss of the intestinal mucosal barrier. Ischemia-induced damage to the intestinal epithelium is repaired by stimulation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), and paracrine signaling from the vascular niche regulates intestinal regeneration. Here, we identify FOXC1 and FOXC2 as essential regulators of paracrine signaling in intestinal regeneration after ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)- and lymphatic EC (LEC)-specific deletions of Foxc1, Foxc2, or both in mice worsen I/R-induced intestinal damage by causing defects in vascular regrowth, expression of chemokine CXCL12 and Wnt activator R-spondin 3 (RSPO3) in blood ECs (BECs) and LECs, respectively, and activation of Wnt signaling in ISCs. Both FOXC1 and FOXC2 directly bind to regulatory elements of the CXCL12 and RSPO3 loci in BECs and LECs, respectively. Treatment with CXCL12 and RSPO3 rescues the I/R-induced intestinal damage in EC- and LEC-Foxc mutant mice, respectively.

      "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury accompanied by oxidative stress is responsible for postoperative liver dysfunction and failure of liver surgery. However, the dynamic non-invasive mapping of redox homeostasis in deep-seated liver during hepatic I/R injury remains a great challenge. Herein, inspired by the intrinsic reversibility of disulfide bond in proteins, a kind of reversible redox-responsive magnetic nanoparticles (RRMNs) is designed for reversible imaging of both oxidant and antioxidant levels (ONOO-/GSH), based on sulfhydryl coupling/cleaving reaction. We develop a facile strategy to prepare such reversible MRI nanoprobe via one-step surface modification. Owing to the significant change in size during the reversible response, the imaging sensitivity of RRMNs is greatly improved, which enables RRMNs to monitor the tiny change of oxidative stress in liver injury. Notably, such reversible MRI nanoprobe can non-invasively visualize the deep-seated liver tissue slice by slice in living mice. Moreover, this MRI nanoprobe can not only report molecular information about the degree of liver injury but also provide anatomical information about where the pathology occurred. The reversible MRI probe is promising for accurately and facilely monitoring I/R process, accessing injury degree and developing powerful strategy for precise treatment.\n",

      "Purpose: The aim is to investigate the effect of toludesvenlafaxine (Tdv), a reuptake inhibitor of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, on the neurological function in cerebral ischemic rats and the underlying mechanisms. Material and Methods: Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was induced in rats and the neuroprotective effects of Tdv were evaluated by infarct size, Garcia test, and beam walking test. Neuronal apoptosis in the peri-infarct area was observed by TUNEL staining. And the apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated with Western blotting. The role of CREB pathway in effect of Tdv was also investigated using Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Results: In the MCAO/R model, administration of Tdv reduced the infarct size, promoted neural functional recovery, decreased the expression of Bax and Caspase-3, and increased the expression of Bcl-2 and BDNF. In addition, Tdv reduced neuronal apoptosis in the peri-infarct area. Tdv increased the expression of phosphorylated CREB. The application of the specific CREB inhibitor, compound 666-15, could reverse the anti-ischemic cerebral injury of Tdv in MCAO/R rats. Conclusion: Tdv ameliorated cerebral ischemic injury through reducing neuronal apoptosis and increasing the expression of BDNF via the activation of CREB pathway.\n",

And the NF-кB decoy ODN is a specific inhibitor that suppresses the expression of NF-κB. Herein, we revealed the effect and possible mechanism of mAb2G4/ODN/lip on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI). As shown in the results, post-treatment with mAb2G4/ODN/lip improved the impaired histological morphology in the MI/RI model and elevated cell viability in the H/R model. The mAb2G4/ODN/lip complex inhibited the NLRP3 signaling pathway and decreased the expression of LDH, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and MDA. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that post-treatment with mAb2G4/ODN/lip exerted protective effects against I/R injuries by inhibiting the NF-кB-related inflammatory response.

      "Recently, cuproptosis has been demonstrated to be a new non-apototic cell death mode that is characterized by copper dependence and the regulation of mitochondrial respiration. Cuproptosis is distinct from known cell death modes such as apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis, or ferroptosis. Excessive copper induces cuproptosis by promoting protein toxic stress reactions via copper-dependent anomalous oligomerization of lipoylation proteins in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and reducing iron-sulfur cluster protein levels. Ferredoxin1 (FDX1) promotes dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (DLAT) lipoacylation and abates iron-sulfur cluster proteins by reducing Cu2+ to Cu+, inducing cell death. Copper homeostasis depends on the copper transporter, and disturbances to this homeostasis cause cuproptosis. Recent evidence has shown that cuproptosis plays a significant role in the occurrence and development of many cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, heart failure, atherosclerosis, and arrhythmias. Copper chelators, such as ammonium tetrathiomolybdate(VI) and DL-Penicillamine, may ease the above cardiovascular diseases by inhibiting the cuproptosis pathway. Oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors may inhibit cuproptosis by inhibiting protein stress response. In conclusion, cuproptosis plays an essential role in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of cardiovascular cuproptosis is expected to become a potential treatment. Here, we will thoroughly review the molecular mechanisms involved in cuproptosis and its significance in cardiovascular disease.\n",

      "The translocation of Drp1 from the cytosol to mitochondria leads to Drp1 activation and mitochondrial fission in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). However, the molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial Drp1 translocation remains poorly understood. Mitochondrial Drp1 recruitment relies on 4 binding partners including MiD49, MiD51, Mff and Fis1. This study was to elucidate which one facilitate mitochondrial Drp1 translocation and its role in MI/R injury. MI/R was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min and subsequent reperfusion for 3 h. Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia for 2 h and reoxygenation for 4 h. SiRNA or Adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing shRNA was used to knock down the key binding partner in vitro or in vivo respectively. The expression of MiD51 rather than other binding partners (MiD49, Mff or Fis1) was increased after MI/R. MiD51 knockdown inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) or ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced mitochondrial Drp1 translocation. SiRNA-induced knockdown of MiD51 suppressed mitochondrial oxidative stress, improved mitochondrial function and alleviate cellular injury in H/R cardiomyocytes. AAV-mediated knockdown of MiD51 reduced myocardial injury and improved cardiac function in the I/R hearts, while mitochondrial Drp1 translocation and cardiac function were not affected by MiD51 knockdown in the hearts without I/R. MiD51 is identified as the binding partner that promotes mitochondrial Drp1 translocation and contributes to MI/R injury. Inhibition of MiD51 may be a potential therapeutic target to alleviate MI/R injury.\n",

      "Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of regulated cellular demise, characterized by the accumulation of intracellular oxidative stress that is dependent on iron. Ferroptosis plays a crucial role not only in the development and treatment of tumors but also in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and illnesses related to ischemia-reperfusion injury. This mode of cell death possesses distinctive properties that differentiate it from other forms of cell death, including unique morphological changes at both the cellular and subcellular levels, as well as molecular features that can be detected using specific methods. The use of fluorescent probes has become an invaluable means of detecting ferroptosis, owing to their high sensitivity, real-time in situ monitoring capabilities, and minimal damage to biological samples. This review comprehensively elucidates the physiological mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, while also detailing the development of fluorescent probes capable of detecting ferroptosis-related active species across various cellular compartments, including organelles, the nucleus, and the cell membrane. Additionally, the review explores how the dynamic changes and location of active species from different cellular compartments can influence the ignition and execution of ferroptotic cell death. Finally, we discuss the future challenges and opportunities for imaging ferroptosis. We believe that this review will not only aid in the elucidation of ferroptosis's physiological mechanisms but also facilitate the identification of novel treatment targets and means of accurately diagnosing and treating ferroptosis-related diseases.\n",

Given the influence of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, skin flaps are prone to several complications, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Numerous attempts have been undertaken to enhance the survival rate of skin flaps entailing pre/post-conditioning with surgical and pharmacological modalities. Various cellular and molecular mechanisms are employed in these approaches in order to reduce inflammation, promote angiogenesis and blood perfusion, and induce apoptosis and autophagy. With the emerging role of multiple stem cell lineages and their ability to improve skin flap viability, these approaches are increasingly being used to develop even more translationally applicable methods.

      "As a transcriptional activator widely expressed in various tissues, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is involved in the regulation of the immune system, the development of the heart and brain systems, and classically mediating pathological processes such as cardiac hypertrophy. Oxidative stress is an imbalance of intracellular redox status, characterized by excessive generation of reactive oxygen species, accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium overload, and subsequent lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Oxidative stress occurs during various pathological processes, such as chronic hypoxia, vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype switching, ischemia-reperfusion, and cardiac remodeling. Calcium overload leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, while NFAT can be activated through calcium-calcineurin, which is also the main regulatory mode of NFAT factors. This review focuses on the effects of NFAT transcription factors on reactive oxygen species production, calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, redox reactions, lipid peroxidation, inflammation, and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress. We hope to provide a reference for the functions and characteristics of NFAT involved in various stages of oxidative stress as well as related potential targets.\n",

DJ-1, a multifunctional protein that participated in transcription regulation and antioxidant defense, was shown to provide a significant protective impact in cardiac cells treated with ischemia-reperfusion. We created a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model in vivo and in vitro by ligating the left anterior descending branch of rats and subjecting H9c2 cells to anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) to investigate whether RES reduces myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by upregulating DJ-1. We discovered that RES dramatically enhanced cardiac function in rats with I/R. Subsequently, we found that RES prevented the rise in autophagy (P62 degradation and LC3-II/LC3-I increase) induced by cardiac ischemia-reperfusion in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the autophagic agonist rapamycin (RAPA) eliminated RES-induced cardioprotective effects. In addition, Further data showed that RES significantly increased the expression of DJ-1 in the myocardium with the treatment of I/R. At the same time, pretreatment with RES reduced phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1) and Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) stimulated by cardiac ischemia-reperfusion, and Beclin-1 mRNA and protein levels while decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and improving cell viability. However, the lentiviral shDJ-1 and JNK agonist anisomycin disrupted the effects of RES. In summary, RES could inhibit autophagy against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through DJ-1 modulation of the MEKK1/JNK pathway, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for cardiac homeostasis.\n",

      "In ischemia-reperfusion stroke, microglia play a dual role in brain injury as well as brain repair, and promoting their switch from a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype is considered to be a potential therapeutic strategy. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid that exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, but its effect on microglia polarization is unknown. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of DHA on rat brain following ischemia-reperfusion injury, and to investigate the mechanism by which DHA regulates microglia polarization. We administered DHA 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily for 3 d following a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion model in rats. The protective effects of DHA on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury were detected by TTC staining, HE staining, Nissler staining, and TUNEL staining. Quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of M1 and M2 microglia-associated markers and PPARγ-mediated ERK/AKT signaling pathway proteins. We found that DHA significantly improved brain injury by decreasing the expression of the M1 phenotypic marker (iNOS, CD16) and increasing the expression of the M2 phenotypic marker (Arg-1, CD206). DHA also increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mRNA and protein, increased the expression of the pathway protein AKT, and decreased the expression of ERK1/2. In addition, DHA promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors TNF-α and IL-1β. However, the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 greatly blocked these beneficial effects. These results suggest that DHA may activate PPARγ to inhibit ERK and activate AKT signaling pathways to regulate microglia polarization, thereby reducing neuroinflammation and promoting neurological recovery to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n",

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the modulatory effect of Reba on SIRT1/β-catenin/FOXO1-NFκB signaling cascade. Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups: G1 (sham): rats were subjected to surgical stress without I/R, GII (I/R): rats were subjected to 60 min/4-h I/R, GIII (Reba + I/R): rats received Reba 100 mg/kg/day, p.o. for three weeks, then were subjected to 60 min/4-h I/R, and GIV (Reba + EX527 + I/R): rats received Reba (100 mg/kg/day p.o.) + EX527 (10 mg/kg/day, ip) for three weeks before I/R. Reba pretreatment decreased the serum levels of ALT and AST, improved I/R-induced histological alterations of both intestine and liver, increased hepatic Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) expression/content, β-catenin expression/immunoreactivity, and FOXO1 expression, while suppressed NF-κB p65 expression/protein content. In addition, Reba increased hepatic total antioxidant capacity (TAC), while suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor (TNFα), and caspase-3 activity.

This study aimed to delineate the biological functions of heterogenous CD34+ cell populations and investigate the net effect of CD34+ cell intervention on cardiac remodeling. We confirmed, by combining single-cell RNA sequencing on human and mouse ischemic hearts and an inducible Cd34 lineage-tracing mouse model, that Cd34+ cells mainly contributed to the commitment of mesenchymal cells, endothelial cells (ECs), and monocytes/macrophages during heart remodeling with distinct pathological functions. The Cd34+-lineage-activated mesenchymal cells were responsible for cardiac fibrosis, while CD34+Sca-1high was an active precursor and intercellular player that facilitated Cd34+-lineage angiogenic EC-induced postinjury vessel development. We found through bone marrow transplantation that bone marrow-derived CD34+ cells only accounted for inflammatory response. We confirmed using a Cd34-CreERT2; R26-DTA mouse model that the depletion of Cd34+ cells could alleviate the severity of ventricular fibrosis after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury with improved cardiac function. This study provided a transcriptional and cellular landscape of CD34+ cells in normal and ischemic hearts and illustrated that the heterogeneous population of Cd34+ cell-derived cells served as crucial contributors to cardiac remodeling and function after the I/R injury, with their capacity to generate diverse cellular lineages.\n",

This study aimed to clarify the combined effects of these treatments. Rat livers were subjected to 48-hour CS and a subsequent 90-minute reperfusion in an isolated perfused rat liver system. The experimental groups were the immediately reperfused control group (CT), the CS with University of Wisconsin solution (UW) group, the CS with Dsol group, the CS with UW and post-reperfusion H2 treatment group (UW-H2), and the CS with Dsol and post-reperfusion H2 group (Dsol-H2). We first compared the Dsol-H2, UW, and CT groups to evaluate this alternative method to conventional CS. The protective potential of the Dsol-H2 group was superior to that of the UW group, as evidenced by lower portal venous resistance and lactate dehydrogenase leakage, a higher oxygen consumption rate, and increased bile production. Multiple comparison tests among the UW, Dsol, UW-H2, and Dsol-H2 groups revealed that both treatments, during CS and after reperfusion, conferred a similar extent of protection and showed additive effects in combination therapy. Furthermore, the variance in all treatment groups appeared smaller than that in the no-treatment or no-stress groups, with excellent reproducibility. In conclusion, combination therapy with Dsol during CS and hydrogen gas after reperfusion additively protects against graft injury.\n",

Neurological deficits were assessed with the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Western blot (WB) analysis was used to detect the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the cerebral cortex. The inflammatory state was quantitatively evaluated by measuring the expression of phospho-Nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF-κB), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) using WB analysis and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemical staining. The protein expression of zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1), occludin, caudin-5 and CD31 was examined by immunohistochemical staining to determine blood‒brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Exosomes were extracted from the brain interstitial space by ultracentrifugation and identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), WB analysis and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The origin of exosomes was clarified by measuring the specific mRNAs within exosomes via Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT‒qPCR). Differential miRNAs in exosomes were identified using microarray screening and were validated by RT‒qPCR. Exosomes were labelled with fluorescent dye (PKH26) and incubated with bEnd.3 cells, the supernatant was collected, IL-1β/TNF-α expression was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), total RNA was extracted, and miR-200a-3p/141-3p expression was examined by RT‒qPCR. In addition, the levels of miR-200a-3p/141-3p in oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced bEnd.3 cells were quantified. The direct interaction between miR-200a-3p/141-3p and the SIRT1 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) was measured by determining SIRT1 expression in bEnd.3 cells transfected with the miR-200a-3p/141-3p mimic/inhibitor.\n",

Furthermore, we found that miR-200a-3p/141-3p was enriched in astrocyte-derived exosomes from GCI/R-induced mice and could be inhibited by treatment with a medium dose of AA. The exosomes mediated the transfer of miR-200a-3p/141-3p into bEnd.3 cells, promoted IL-1β and TNF-α release and downregulated the expression of SIRT1.

Ramelteon has neuroprotection for chronic ischemia animals, but the effect and the biological mechanism of it on PSD is still unclear. This study explored the effects of ramelteon with prophylactic administration on blood-brain barrier in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and the oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) bEnd.3 cells and found that ramelteon pretreatment improved the depressive-like behaviors and decreased infarct area in MCAO rats. Also, this study found ramelteon pretreatment improved viability and inhibited permeability in OGD/R cells. In addition, this study found that MCP-1, TNF-α, and IL-1 levels were raised in the MCAO rats and that occludin protein and mRNA levels were decreased in the MCAO and the OGD/R models, while the Egr-1 level was up-regulated. All of these were antagonized by ramelteon pretreatment. In addition, overexpression of Egr-1 could reverse the effect of 100 nM ramelteon pretreatment on FITC and occludin levels in OGD/R cells. In short, this study has demonstrated that the protective effect on PSD of ramelteon pretreatment on MCAO rats is related to the development of BBB permeability and that ramelteon regulates occludin to protect the BBB by inhibiting Egr-1.\n",

      "The dysregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and/or solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) is believed to contribute to ferroptosis in the hearts suffered ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), but the mechanisms behind the dysregulation of them are not fully elucidated. Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) can function as a paracaspase to cleave specified substrates and it is predicted to interact with Nrf2. This study aims to explore whether targeting MALT1 can reduce I/R-induced ferroptosis via enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway. The SD rat hearts were subjected to 1h-ischemia plus 3h-reperfusion to establish the I/R injury model, which showed myocardial injuries (increase in infarct size and creatine kinase release) and up-regulation of MALT1 while downregulation of Nrf2 and SLC7A11 concomitant with the increased ferroptosis, reflecting by an increase in glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) level while decreases in the levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4), total iron, Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation (LPO); these phenomena were reversed in the presence of MI-2, a specific inhibitor of MALT1. Consistently, similar results were achieved in the cultured cardiomyocytes subjected to 8h-hypoxia plus 12h-reoxygenation. Furthermore, micafungin, an antifungal drug, could also exert beneficial effect on mitigating myocardial I/R injury via inhibition of MALT1. Based on these observations, we conclud that inhibition of MALT1 can reduce I/R-induced myocardial ferroptosis through enhancing the Nrf2/SLC7A11 pathway; and MALT1 may be used as a potential target to seek novel or existing drugs (such as micafungin) for treating myocardial infarction.\n",

      "Susceptibility to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in type-2 diabetes (T2DM) remains disputed, although studies have reported that ferroptosis is associated with myocardial IR injury. Nobiletin, a flavonoid isolated from citrus peels, is an antioxidant that possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. However, it remains unknown whether nobiletin has any protective effects on susceptibility to myocardial IR injury during T2DM in rats via ferroptosis. To investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of nobiletin on myocardial IR injury during T2DM, we induced myocardial IR model in rats at T2DM onset vs mature disease. We also established a high-fat high-glucose (HFHG) and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model in H9c2 cells to imitate abnormal glycolipid metabolism during T2DM. Myocardial injury, oxidative stress and ferroptosis towards myocardial IR in rats with mature T2DM but not at T2DM onset were increased. These changes were restored under treatment with ferrostain-1 or nobiletin. Both ferrostain-1 and nobiletin decreased the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins including Acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4) but not glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in rats with mature T2DM and cells with HFHG and H/R injury. Nobiletin strengthened the effect of si-ACSL4 on inhibiting ACSL4 expression, and also inhibited the effect of Erastin or oe-ACSL4 on increasing ACSL4 expression. Taken together, our data indicates that ferroptosis involves in susceptibility to myocardial IR injury in rats during T2DM. Nobiletin has therapeutic potential for alleviating myocardial IR injury associated with ACSL4- and NCOA4-related ferroptosis.\n",

The bioinformatic analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs further confirmed that STAT3 signaling might be involved in the cardioprotection of DEX. Upon H/R treatment in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, 5 μM DEX pretreatment improved cell viability (P = .0005), inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and calcium overload (both P ≤ .0040), decreased cell apoptosis (P = .0470), and promoted STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 (0.102 ± 0.0224 vs 0.297 ± 0.0937; P < .0001) and Ser727 (0.586 ± 0.177 vs 0.886 ± 0.0546; P = .0157), which could be abolished by Stattic.\n",

      "Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) is a widely used method in sports and rehabilitation therapies to simulate physical exercise. EMS treatment via skeletal muscle activity improves the cardiovascular functions and the overall physical condition of the patients. However, the cardioprotective effect of EMS has not been proven so far, therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential cardiac conditioning effect of EMS in an animal model. Low-frequency 35-min EMS was applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of male Wistar rats for three consecutive days. Their isolated hearts were then subjected to 30 min global ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. At the end of reperfusion cardiac specific creatine kinase (CK-MB) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme release and myocardial infarct size were determined. Additionally, skeletal muscle-driven myokine expression and release were also assessed. Phosphorylation of cardioprotective signaling pathway members AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 proteins were also measured. EMS significantly attenuated cardiac LDH and CK-MB enzyme activities in the coronary effluents at the end of the ex vivo reperfusion. EMS treatment considerably altered the myokine content of the stimulated gastrocnemius muscle without altering circulating myokine levels in the serum. Additionally, phosphorylation of cardiac AKT, ERK1/2, and STAT3 was not significantly different in the two groups. Despite the lack of significant infarct size reduction, the EMS treatment seems to influence the course of cellular damage due to ischemia/reperfusion and favorably modifies skeletal muscle myokine expressions. Our results suggest that EMS may have a protective effect on the myocardium, however, further optimization is required.\n",

      "Diabetes-aggravated myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury remains an urgent medical issue, and the molecular mechanisms involved with diabetes and MI/R injury remain largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that inflammation and P2X7 signaling participate in the pathogenesis of the heart under individual conditions. It remains to be explored if P2X7 signaling is exacerbated or alleviated under double insults. We established a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model, and we compared the differences in immune cell infiltration and P2X7 expression between diabetic and nondiabetic mice after 24 h of reperfusion. The antagonist and agonist of P2X7 were administered before and after MI/R. Our study showed that the MI/R injury of diabetic mice was characterized by increased infarct area, impaired ventricular contractility, more apoptosis, aggravated immune cell infiltration, and overactive P2X7 signaling compared with nondiabetic mice. The major trigger of increased P2X7 was the MI/R-induced recruitment of monocytes and macrophages, and diabetes can be a synergistic factor in this process. Administration of P2X7 agonist eliminated the differences in MI/R injury between nondiabetic mice and diabetic mice. Both 2 wk of brilliant blue G injection before MI/R and acutely administered A438079 at the time of MI/R injury attenuated the role of diabetes in exacerbating MI/R injury, as evidenced by decreased infarct size, improved cardiac function, and inhibition of apoptosis. Additionally, brilliant blue G blockade decreased the heart rate after MI/R, which was accompanied by downregulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression and nerve growth factor transcription. In conclusion, targeting P2X7 may be a promising strategy for reducing the risk of MI/R injury in diabetes.\n",

      "Objective: We aimed to explore the protective effect of Panax notoginseng rhizomes (PNR) on renal ischemia and reperfusion injury (RIRI) and the underlying molecular network mechanism based on network pharmacology and combined systemic experimental validation. Methods: A bilateral RIRI model was established, and Cr, SCr, and BUN levels were detected. Then, the PNR was pretreated 1 week before the RIRI model was prepared. To determine the effects of the PNR in RIRI, histopathological damage and the effect of PNRs to the kidney was assessed, using TTC, HE, and TUNEL staining. Furthermore, the underlying network pharmacology mechanism was detected by screening drug-disease intersection targets from PPI protein interactions and GO and KEGG analysis, and the hub genes were screened for molecular docking based on the Degree value. Finally, the expression of hub genes in kidney tissues was verified by qPCR, and the protein expression of related genes was further detected by Western blot (WB). Results: PNR pretreatment could effectively increase Cr level, decrease SCr and BUN levels, reduce renal infarct areas and renal tubular cell injury areas, and inhibit renal cell apoptosis. By using network pharmacology combined with bioinformatics, we screened co-targets both Panax notoginseng (Sanchi) and RIRI, acquired ten hub genes, and successfully performed molecular docking. Of these, pretreatment with the PNR reduced the mRNA levels of IL6 and MMP9 at postoperative day 1 and TP53 at postoperative day 7, and the protein expression of MMP9 at postoperative day 1 in IRI rats. These results showed that the PNR could decrease kidney pathological injury in IRI rats and inhibit apoptotic reaction and cell inflammation so as to improve renal injury effectively, and the core network mechanism is involved in the inhibition of MMP9, TP53, and IL-6. Conclusion: The PNR has a marked protective effect for RIRI, and the underlying mechanism is involved in inhibiting the expression of MMP9, TP53, and IL-6. This striking discovery not only provides fruitful evidence for the protective effect of the PNR in RIRI rats but also provides a novel mechanic explanation.\n",

Moreover, it is unclear whether the JAK2/STAT3 pathway is responsible for the neuroprotective effect of EP. Therefore, we aimed to explore the impact of EP, other than the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic functions, on the Th17/Treg balance via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced model.\n",

Regarding inflammation, EP reduced the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-17 and elevated those of IL-10 and TGF-β.

Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue is divided into superficial and deep layers by a superficial fascia. Adipose tissue easily collected by liposuction is usually obtained from a deep layer, so ASCs derived from a deep layer are generally used for regenerative medicine.

      "Retinal ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common cause of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis and axonal degeneration, resulting in irreversible visual impairment. However, there are no available neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies for retinal I/R injury, and more effective therapeutic approaches are needed. The role of the myelin sheath of the optic nerve after retinal I/R remains unknown. Here, we report that demyelination of the optic nerve is an early pathological feature of retinal I/R and identify sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) as a therapeutic target for alleviating demyelination in a model of retinal I/R caused by rapid changes in intraocular pressure. Targeting the myelin sheath via S1PR2 protected RGCs and visual function. In our experiment, we observed early damage to the myelin sheath and persistent demyelination accompanied by S1PR2 overexpression after injury. Blockade of S1PR2 by the pharmacological inhibitor JTE-013 reversed demyelination, increased the number of oligodendrocytes, and inhibited microglial activation, contributing to the survival of RGCs and alleviating axonal damage. Finally, we evaluated the postoperative recovery of visual function by recording visual evoked potentials and assessing the quantitative optomotor response. In conclusion, this study is the first to reveal that alleviating demyelination by inhibiting S1PR2 overexpression may be a therapeutic strategy for retinal I/R-related visual impairment.\n",

Among these pathways, glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism play important roles in regulating myocardial energy metabolism. Therefore, this article focuses on the roles of glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, including glycolysis, glucose uptake and transport, glycogen metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway; and triglyceride metabolism, fatty acid uptake and transport, phospholipid metabolism, lipoprotein metabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. Finally, due to the different alterations and development of glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, there are also complex interregulatory relationships between them. In the future, modulating the equilibrium between glucose metabolism and lipid metabolism in cardiomyocytes and ameliorating aberrations in myocardial energy metabolism represent highly promising novel strategies for addressing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore, a comprehensive exploration of glycolipid metabolism can offer novel theoretical and clinical insights into the prevention and treatment of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) remain an intractable problem and have high morbidity and mortality worldwide, as well as substantial health and economic burdens, representing an urgent clinical need. In recent years, the focus of research has shifted from the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for transplantation to the use of their secretory exosomes (MSC-exosomes) for the treatment of numerous CVDs, including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), aneurysm, and stroke. MSCs are pluripotent stem cells with multiple differentiation pathways that exert pleiotropic effects by producing soluble factors, the most effective components of which are exosomes. MSC-exosomes are considered to be an excellent and promising cell-free therapy for CVDs due to their higher circulating stability, improved biocompatibility, reduced toxicity, and immunogenicity. In addition, exosomes play critical roles in repairing CVDs by inhibiting apoptosis, regulating inflammation, ameliorating cardiac remodeling, and promoting angiogenesis. Herein, we describe knowledge about the biological characteristics of MSC-exosomes, investigate the mechanism by which MSC-exosomes mediate therapeutic repair, and summarize recent advances in the efficacy of MSC-exosomes in CVDs, with a view toward future clinical applications.\n",

A total of 51 patients will be randomized, 17 in the sham control arm and 34 in the intervention arm. The primary outcome measure will be the feasibility of RIC delivered for 7 days or at the time of discharge. The secondary device-related outcome measures are fidelity of RIC delivery and the completion rate of intervention. The secondary clinical outcome includes a modified Rankin scale, recurrent stroke and cognitive assessment at 90 days.\n",

      "Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has revolutionized large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke management, but often requires advanced imaging. The collateral pattern on CT angiograms may be an alternative because a symmetric collateral pattern correlates with a slowly growing, small ischemic core. We tested the hypothesis that such patients will have favorable outcomes after EVT. Consecutive patients (n = 74) with anterior LVOs who underwent EVT were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were available CTA and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS). CTA collateral patterns were symmetric in 36%, malignant in 24%, or other in 39%. Median NIHSS was 11 for symmetric, 18 for malignant, and 19 for other (p = 0.02). Ninety-day mRS ≤2, indicating independent living, was achieved in 67% of symmetric, 17% of malignant, and 38% of other patterns (p = 0.003). A symmetric collateral pattern was a significant determinant of 90-day mRS ≤2 (aOR = 6.62, 95%CI = 2.24,19.53; p = 0.001) in a multivariable model that included age, NIHSS, baseline mRS, thrombolysis, LVO location, and successful reperfusion. We conclude that a symmetric collateral pattern predicts favorable outcomes after EVT for LVO stroke. Because the pattern also marks slow ischemic core growth, patients with symmetric collaterals may be suitable for transfer for thrombectomy. A malignant collateral pattern is associated with poor clinical outcomes.\n",

      "High-mobility group box1 (HMGB1) induces inflammatory injury, and emerging reports suggest that it is critical for brain ischemia reperfusion. Engeletin, a natural Smilax glabra rhizomilax derivative, is reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity. Herein, we examined the mechanism of engeletin-mediated neuroprotection in rats having transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. Male SD rats were induced using a 1.5 h tMCAO, following by reperfusion for 22.5 h. Engeletin (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg) was intravenously administered immediately following 0.5 h of ischemia. Based on our results, engeletin, in a dose-dependent fashion, reduced neurological deficits, infarct size, histopathological alterations, brain edema and inflammatory factors, namely, circulating IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ. Furthermore, engeletin treatment markedly reduced neuronal apoptosis, which, in turn, elevated Bcl-2 protein levels, while suppressing Bax and Cleaved Caspase-3 protein levels. Meanwhile, engeletin significantly reduces overall expressions of HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-κB and attenuated nuclear transfer of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in ischemic cortical tissue. In conclusion, engeletin strongly prevents focal cerebral ischemia via suppression of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory network.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common occurrence in various surgical procedures used to treat heart diseases. However, the role of insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) during the process of myocardial I/R remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the expression, distribution, and functionality of IGF2R in various I/R-associated models (such as reoxygenation, revascularization, and heart transplant). Loss-of-function studies (including myocardial conditional knockout and CRISPR interference) were performed to clarify the role of IGF2R in I/R injuries. Following hypoxia, IGF2R expression increased, but this effect was reversed upon restoration of oxygen levels. Loss of myocardial IGF2R was found to enhance the cardiac contractile functions, and reduced cell infiltration or cardiac fibrosis of I/R mouse models compared to the genotype control. CRISPR-inhibition of IGF2R decreased cell apoptotic death under hypoxia. RNA sequencing analysis indicated that myocardial IGF2R played a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response, innate immune response, and apoptotic process following I/R. Integrated analysis of the mRNA profiling, pulldown assays, and mass spectrometry identified granulocyte-specific factors as potential targets of myocardial IGF2R in the injured heart. In conclusion, myocardial IGF2R emerges as a promising therapeutic target to ameliorate inflammation or fibrosis following I/R injuries.\n",

      "The kidneys are the most vulnerable organs to severe ischemic insult that results in cellular hypoxia under pathophysiological conditions. Large amounts of oxygen are consumed by the kidneys, mainly to produce energy for tubular reabsorption. Beyond high oxygen demand and the low oxygen supply, different other factors make kidneys vulnerable to ischemia which is deemed to be a major cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). On the other hand, kidneys are capable of sensing and responding to oxygen alternations to evade harms resulting from inadequate oxygen. The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the main conserved oxygen-sensing mechanism that maintains homeostasis under hypoxia through direct/indirect regulation of several genes that contribute to metabolic adaptation, angiogenesis, energy conservation, erythropoiesis, and so on. In response to oxygen availability, prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) control the HIF stability. This review focuses on the oxygen-sensing mechanisms in kidneys, particularly in proximal tubular cells (PTCs) and discusses the molecules involved in ischemic response and metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, the possible roles of non-coding RNAs (microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) in the development of ischemic AKI are put forward.\n",

Nevertheless, there are few reports on its action on intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In this study, we mainly explored the effect of Bryo-1 on intestinal I/R injury and determined the mechanism. C57BL/6J mice underwent temporary superior mesenteric artery (SMA) obturation to induce I/R, on the contrary, Caco-2 cells suffered to oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) to establish the in vitro model. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS to induce macrophage inflammation. The drug gradient experiment was used to demonstrate in vivo and in vitro models. Bryo-1 ameliorated the intestinal I/R-induced injury of multiple organs and epithelial cells. It also alleviated intestinal I/R-induced barrier disruption of intestines according to the histology, intestinal permeability, intestinal bacterial translocation rates, and tight junction protein expression results. Bryo-1 significantly inhibited oxidative stress damages and inflammation, which may contribute to the restoration of intestinal barrier function. Further, Bryo-1 significantly activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in vivo. However, the deletion of Nrf2 in Caco-2 and RAW264.7 cells attenuated the protective functions of Bryo-1 and significantly abolished the anti-inflammatory effect of Bryo-1 on LPS-induced macrophage inflammation. Bryo-1 protects intestines against I/R-induced injury.

IRI was surgically induced in mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R). Quantitative genetic analysis and western blotting were performed to assess mRNA and protein levels, respectively, of PPARγ, as well as of different inflammatory, fibrosis, and apoptosis markers in cells and tissues. PPARγ was overexpressed in the heart of mice and NRCMs by viral transfection. Apoptosis and fibrosis were detected by TUNEL and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect M1 and M2 macrophage-related inflammatory factors present in mouse sera. PPARγ overexpression significantly inhibited OGD/R- and IRI-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PPARγ overexpression inhibited IRI-induced secretion of M1-related proinflammatory factors, whereas it supported the secretion of M2-related anti-inflammatory factors. Notably, these events were found to be mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway. In conclusion, PPARγ regulates macrophage polarization upon IRI via the JAK/STAT pathway, which will in turn prevent myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis. Hence, PPARγ may represent a valuable target for myocardial IRI treatment.\n",

Increased activation-recovery interval heterogeneity correlated with enhanced arrhythmia susceptibility. Cellular population studies (ncells=635-862 cells per region) demonstrated greater heterogeneity of action potential duration in the BZ (SD, 105.9±17.0 ms versus remote: 73.9±8.6 ms; P=0.001; npigs=6), which correlated with heterogeneity of activation-recovery interval in vivo. Cell-cell gene expression heterogeneity in the BZ was evidenced by increased Euclidean distances between nuclei of the BZ (12.1 [9.2-15.0] versus 10.6 [7.5-11.6] in remote; P<0.0001). Differentially expressed genes characterizing BZ cardiomyocyte remodeling included hypertrophy-related and ion channel-related genes with high cell-cell variability of expression. These gene expression changes were driven by stress-responsive TFs (transcription factors). In addition, heterogeneity of left ventricular wall thickness was greater in the BZ than in remote.\n",

Ginkgolide B (GB) can antagonize the platelet activating factor receptor and has shown a significant curative effect on cerebral ischemia. However, GB and other drugs for IS have shown poor clinical efficacy due to their inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Herein, red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) were developed as biocompatible nanocarriers to deliver GB to the brain tissue. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments verified the ability of GB-CPDs to penetrate the BBB, and GB-CPDs remained in the brain significantly longer than unmodified CPDs. In a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), circulatory administration of GB-CPDs effectively reduced cerebral infarct size and neuronal apoptosis, with a significantly better therapeutic effect compared to GB.

Procyanidin B2 (PB2), a naturally occurring flavonoid in large quantities in various fruits, has been demonstrated to exhibit several significant pharmacological properties. However, the effect of PB2 on flap viability is not clearly known. Here, using Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining, we observed that PB2 significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammation and enhanced angiogenesis. Mechanically, we provided evidence for the first time that the beneficial effects of PB2 occur through the activation of the Sirt1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, co-administration of PB2 and EX527, a selective inhibitor of Sirt1, resulted in down-regulation of the expression of Sirt1, Nrf2, and downstream antioxidants. In summary, our study showed that PB2 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the survival of random-pattern skin flaps.\n",

Then, based on the HK-2 cell model of hypothermic OGD, we found that CIRP silencing significantly stimulated the expression of the TGF-β1/p38 MAPK inflammatory pathway by activating the PHD3/HIF-1α axis, and induced more severe apoptosis through the mitochondrial cytochrome c-Apaf-1-caspase 9 and FADD-caspase 8 death receptor pathways compared with untransfected cells. However, silencing PHD3 remarkably activated the expression of HIF-1α and alleviated the apoptosis of HK-2 cells in hypothermic OGD.

To understand the mechanisms that underpin CA-induced brain injury and, subsequently, develop effective treatments, experimental CA research is essential. To this end, a few mouse CA models have been established. In most of these models, the mice are placed in the supine position in order to perform chest compression for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, this resuscitation procedure makes the real-time imaging/monitoring of brain physiology during CA and resuscitation challenging. To obtain such critical knowledge, the present protocol presents a mouse asphyxia CA model that does not require the chest compression CPR step. This model allows for the study of dynamic changes in blood flow, vascular structure, electrical potentials, and brain tissue oxygen from the pre-CA baseline to early post-CA reperfusion.

      "Effective amelioration of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced intestinal injury and revealing its mechanisms remain the challenges in both preclinic and clinic. Potential mechanisms of naringin in ameliorating I/R-induced intestinal injury remain unknown. Based on pre-experiments, I/R-injured rat intestine in vivo and hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-injured IEC-6 cells in vitro were used to verify that naringin-alleviated I/R-induced intestinal injury was mediated via deactivating cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Naringin improved intestinal damage using hematoxylin and eosin staining and decreased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase contents in plasma. Naringin decreased inflammation characterized by reducing IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-β contents in both plasma and IEC-6 cells. Naringin mitigated oxidative stress via recovering superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde levels in the I/R-injured intestine. Naringin reduced the expression of apoptotic proteins, including Bax, caspase-3, and Bcl-2, and reduced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling-positive cells both in vivo and in vitro, and decreased Hoechst 33342 signals in vitro. cGAS, STING, p-TBK1, p-IRF3, and NF-κB expressions were up-regulated both in vivo and in vitro respectively and the up-regulated indexes were reversed by naringin. Transfection of cGAS-siRNA and cGAS-cDNA significantly down-regulated and up-regulated cGAS-STING signaling-related protein expressions, respectively, and partially weakened naringin-induced amelioration on these indexes, suggesting that deactivation of cGAS-STING signaling is the crucial target for naringin-induced amelioration on I/R-injured intestine.\n",

      "Glaucoma is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with age. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aß) proteins in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and subsequent retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss is an established pathological hallmark of the disease. The mechanism through which Aß provokes RGC loss remains unclear. The receptor for the advanced glycation end product (RAGE), and its ligand Aß, have been shown to mediate neuronal loss via internalizing Aß within the neurons. In this study, we investigated whether the RAGE-Aß axis plays a role in RGC loss in experimental glaucoma.\n",

      "This is a mini review on the biotechnological aspects of the most extensively developed hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers The emphasis is on the most recent Polyhemoglobin-catalase-superoxide dismutase-carbonic anhydrase (PolyHb-CAT-SOD-CA), which is a nanobiotechnological complex that is being investigated and scaled up with the potential for clinical use as nanobiotherapeutics. Hemoglobin, a tetramer, is an excellent oxygen carrier. However, in the body it is converted into toxic dimers. Diacid or glutaraldehyde can crosslink hemoglobin into polyhemoglobin (PolyHb) and prevent its breakdown into toxic dimers. This has been developed and tested in clinical trials. A bovine polyhemoglobin has been approved for routine clinical use for surgical procedures in South Africa and Russia. Clinical trials with human PolyHb in hemorrhagic shock were effective but with a very slight increase in non-fatal myocardial ischemia. This could be due to a number of reasons. For those conditions with ischemia-reperfusion, one would need an oxygen carrier with antioxidant properties. One approach to remedy this is with prepared polyhemoglobin-catalase-superoxide dismutase (PolyHb-CAT-SOD). Another reason is an increase in intracellular pCO2. We therefore added an enhanced level of carbonic anhydrase to prepare a PolyHb-CAT-SOD-CA. The result is an oxygen carrier with enhanced Carbonic Anhydrase for CO2 transport and enhanced Catalase and Superoxide Dismutase for antioxidant functions. Detailed efficacy and safety studies have led to the industrial scale up towards clinical trial. In the meantime, oxygen carriers are being investigated around the world for use in ex vivo biotechnological fluid for organ preservation for transplantation, with one already approved in France.\n",

      "The identification of novel treatments for severe burn wounds relies on accurate clinical assessments of the extent of injury. However, evaluation of burn wound depth can be challenging due to the tendency for burn wounds to progress over time in a little-understood process known as 'burn wound conversion'. Local factors affecting the burn wound, such as inflammation, oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, vasostasis and bacterial infections, lead to increased cell death by apoptosis or oncosis, while systemic events may promote burn wound conversion. Acute shock, metabolic derangements, age or immunomodulation can modify cytokine secretion, lower immune responses, decrease blood flow or cause bacterial infection at the burn wound site. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting specific mechanisms that reduce cell death, improve wound reperfusion and promote tissue regrowth should favourably enhance burn wound healing, and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Our current understanding of these mechanisms mostly comes from animal studies, underscoring the need for extensive research in humans. A streamlined approach would be to investigate the parallels in other disease states that exhibit ischaemia and potential reperfusion, such as ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Moreover, in view of the limited knowledge available on the subject, the need exists for further clinical research into burn wound conversion and novel target pathways to ameliorate its effects. This review describes events that affect the viability of cells at the burn wound site resulting in burn wound conversion, and identifies potential targets for clinical interventions that may diminish burn wound conversion.\n",

      "The polyamines spermidine and spermine and their common precursor molecule putrescine are involved in tissue injury and repair. Here, we test the hypothesis that impaired polyamine homeostasis contributes to various kidney pathologies in mice during experimental models of ischemia-reperfusion, transplantation, rhabdomyolysis, cyclosporine treatment, arterial hypertension, diabetes, unilateral ureteral obstruction, high oxalate feeding, and adenine-induced injuries. We found a remarkably similar pattern in most kidney pathologies with reduced expression of enzymes involved in polyamine synthesis together with increased expression of polyamine degrading enzymes. Transcript levels of amine oxidase copper-containing 1 (Aoc1), an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of putrescine, were barely detectable by in situ mRNA hybridization in healthy kidneys. Aoc1 was highly expressed upon various experimental kidney injuries resulting in a significant reduction of kidney putrescine content. Kidney levels of spermine were also significantly reduced, whereas spermidine was increased in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Increased Aoc1 expression in injured kidneys was mainly accounted for by an Aoc1 isoform that harbors 22 additional amino acids at its N-terminus and shows increased secretion. Mice with germline deletion of Aoc1 and injured kidneys showed no decrease of kidney putrescine content; although they displayed no overt phenotype, they had fewer tubular casts upon ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hyperosmotic stress stimulated AOC1 expression at the transcriptional and post-transcription levels in metanephric explants and kidney cell lines. AOC1 expression was also significantly enhanced after kidney transplantation in humans. These data demonstrate that the kidneys respond to various forms of injury with down-regulation of polyamine synthesis and activation of the polyamine breakdown pathway. Thus, an imbalance in kidney polyamines may contribute to various etiologies of kidney injury.\n",

      "Retinal ischemic disease is a major type of retinal diseases causing vision loss. Identifying the molecular mechanisms mediating the retinal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) is the key to targeted intervention. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis of the retinal tissues of a retinal ischemia-reperfusion model of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, followed by differential gene expression analysis, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. After studying we found that: The major biological processes affected after RIR was the regulation of vascular development. PPI analysis unveiled a regulatory module in which Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Beta (PDGFRB) was upregulated. In the RIR cell model of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRCEC) induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R), silencing PDGFRB at least partially rescued the detrimental effect on cell proliferation and in vitro angiogenic ability. In the rat model of RIR, the administration of PDGFR inhibitor alleviated the damages in the retinal microvascular system. Besides, we further demonstrated the protective effect of procyanidin against RIR induced damages in both the cell and animal model by dampening the overexpression of PDGFRB. Together, our data indicate that the upregulation of PDGFRB contributes to RIR-induced damages in retinal microvascular system, which provides a targetable strategy for therapeutic intervention.\n",

      "Resuscitation induced ischemia/reperfusion predisposes trauma patients to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. We investigated the effect of remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), a treatment shown to prevent ischemia/reperfusion injury in experimental models of hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation, on the systemic immune-inflammatory profile in trauma patients in a randomized trial. We conducted a prospective, single-centre, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving trauma patients sustaining blunt or penetrating trauma in hemorrhagic shock admitted to a Level 1 trauma centre. Patients were randomized to receive RIC (four cycles of 5-min pressure cuff inflation at 250 mmHg and deflation on the thigh) or a Sham intervention. The primary outcomes were neutrophil oxidative burst activity, cellular adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of myeloperoxidase, cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood samples, drawn at admission (pre-intervention), 1 h, 3 h, and 24 h post﻿-admission. Secondary outcomes included ventilator, ICU and hospital free days, incidence of nosocomial infections, 24 h and 28 day mortality. 50 eligible patients were randomized; of which 21 in the Sham group and 18 in the RIC group were included in the full analysis. No treatment effect was observed between Sham and RIC groups for neutrophil oxidative burst activity, adhesion molecule expression, and plasma levels of myeloperoxidase and cytokines. RIC prevented significant increases in Th2 chemokines﻿ TARC/CCL17 (P < 0.01) and MDC/CCL22 (P < 0.05) at 24 h post-intervention in comparison to the Sham group. Secondary clinical outcomes were not different between groups. No adverse events in relation to the RIC intervention were observed. Administration of RIC was safe and did not adversely affect clinical outcomes. While trauma itself modified several immunoregulatory markers, RIC failed to alter expression of the majority of markers. However, RIC may influence Th2 chemokine expression in the post resuscitation period. Further investigation into the immunomodulatory effects of RIC in traumatic injuries and their impact on clinical outcomes is warranted.ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02071290.\n",

I3C administration to CIRI rats decreased levels of oxidative stress markers and improved aerobic metabolism compared to the animals with CIRI. A decrease in myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokines mRNA levels, and expression of redox-sensitive factor Nuclear Factor-κB was observed in rats with CIRI that received I3C. I3C-treated rats with pathology showed decreased caspase activity and apoptosis-inducing factor expression, compared to the animals in the CIRI group.

      "Cetaceans exhibit physiological adaptations that allowed the transition to aquatic life, including a robust antioxidant defense system that prevents injury from repeated exposure to ischemia/reperfusion events associated with breath-hold diving. The signaling cascades that characterize ischemic inflammation in humans are well characterized. In contrast, cetaceans' molecular and biochemical mechanisms that confer tolerance to inflammatory events are poorly understood. Heme oxygenase (HO) is a cytoprotective protein with anti-inflammatory properties. HO catalyzes the first step in the oxidative degradation of heme. The inducible HO-1 isoform is regulated by various stimuli, including hypoxia, oxidant stress, and inflammatory cytokines. The objective of this study was to compare the response of HO-1 and cytokines to a proinflammatory challenge in leukocytes isolated from humans and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). We measured changes in HO activity, and abundance and expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) in leukocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 and 48 h. HO activity increased (p < 0.05) in dolphin (48 h) but not human cells. TNF-α expression increased in human (24 h, 48 h), but not dolphin cells following LPS stimulation. LPS-induced cytokine expression was lower in dolphin than in human leukocytes, suggesting a blunted cytokine response in bottlenose dolphin leukocytes treated with LPS. Results suggest species-specific regulation of inflammatory cytokines in leukocytes treated with LPS, which may lead to differential responses to a pro-inflammatory challenge between marine and terrestrial mammals.\n",

      "Mitochondrial complex II is traditionally studied for its participation in two key respiratory processes: the electron transport chain and the Krebs cycle. There is now a rich body of literature explaining how complex II contributes to respiration. However, more recent research shows that not all of the pathologies associated with altered complex II activity clearly correlate with this respiratory role. Complex II activity has now been shown to be necessary for a range of biological processes peripherally related to respiration, including metabolic control, inflammation, and cell fate. Integration of findings from multiple types of studies suggests that complex II both participates in respiration and controls multiple succinate-dependent signal transduction pathways. Thus, the emerging view is that the true biological function of complex II is well beyond respiration. This review uses a semichronological approach to highlight major paradigm shifts that occurred over time. Special emphasis is given to the more recently identified functions of complex II and its subunits because these findings have infused new directions into an established field.\n",

      "Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning (IHP) is a well-established cardioprotective intervention in models of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Nevertheless, the significance of IHP in different cardiac pathologies remains elusive. In order to investigate the role of IHP and its effects on calcium-dependent signalization in HF, we employed a model of cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Dox), a widely used drug from the class of cardiotoxic antineoplastics, which was i.p. injected to Wistar rats (4 applications of 4 mg/kg/week). IHP-treated group was exposed to IHP for 2 weeks prior to Dox administration. IHP ameliorated Dox-induced reduction in cardiac output. Western blot analysis revealed increased expression of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) while the expression of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1-α, which is a crucial regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes, was not changed. Animals administered with Dox had further decreased expression of TRPV1 and TRPV4 (transient receptor potential, vanilloid subtype) ion channels along with suppressed Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation. In summary, IHP-mediated improvement in cardiac output in the model of Dox-induced cardiomyopathy is likely a result of increased SERCA2a expression which could implicate IHP as a potential protective intervention in Dox cardiomyopathy, however, further analysis of observed effects is still required.\n",

      "Ferroptosis is a novel type of regulated cell death (RCD) discovered in recent years, where abnormal intracellular iron accumulation leads to the onset of lipid peroxidation, which further leads to the disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis and triggers cell death. Iron accumulation with lipid peroxidation is considered a hallmark of ferroptosis that distinguishes it from other RCDs. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is a process of increased myocardial cell injury that occurs during coronary reperfusion after myocardial ischemia and is associated with high post-infarction mortality. Multiple experiments have shown that ferroptosis plays an important role in MIRI pathophysiology. This review systematically summarized the latest research progress on the mechanisms of ferroptosis. Then we report the possible link between the occurrence of MIRI and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. Finally, we discuss and analyze the related drugs that target ferroptosis to attenuate MIRI and its action targets, and point out the shortcomings of the current state of relevant research and possible future research directions. It is hoped to provide a new avenue for improving the prognosis of the acute coronary syndrome.\n",

Along with other tissue resident immune populations, distinct subsets of ILCs have important roles in either promoting or inhibiting immune tolerance in a variety of contexts, including cancer and autoimmunity. In solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, both donor and recipient derived ILCs could contribute to immune tolerance or rejection, yet understanding of protective or pathogenic functions are only beginning to emerge. In addition to roles in directing or regulating immune responses, ILCs interface with parenchymal cells to support tissue homeostasis and even regeneration. Whether specific ILCs are tissue-protective or enhance ischemia reperfusion injury or fibrosis is of particular interest to the field of transplantation, beyond any roles in limiting or promoting allograft rejection or graft-versus host disease. Within this review, we discuss the current understanding of ILCs functions in promoting immune tolerance and tissue repair at homeostasis and in the context of transplantation, and highlight where targeting or harnessing ILCs could have applications in novel transplant therapies.\n",

      "Geraniol (GE), an acyclic monoterpene, is a chief constituent of essential oils of herbs and fruits. It possesses diverse pharmacological actions like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-parkinson. However, its neuroprotective potential in stroke is yet to be explored at large. The present study evaluated the neuroprotective potential of GE against the global model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury in rats. Bilateral common carotid artery (BCCA) occlusion for 30 min followed by 7 days of reperfusion caused varied biochemical/enzymatic alterations viz. increase in levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitric oxide (NO), xanthine oxidase (XO), and decrease in the levels of cerebroprotectives like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), total thiols, and glutathione (GSH). GE-pretreatment markedly reversed these changes and restored the levels of protective enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants near to normal compared to I/R group. Besides, GE treatment showed marked improvement in anxiety-related behavior and neuronal deficits in animals subjected to I/R injury. Moreover, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained rat brain coronal sections and histopathological studies revealed neuronal protection against I/R-injury, as evidenced by a reduction in infarct area (%) and an increase in hippocampal CA1 neuronal density in the GE-treated groups. The results of this study revealed that GE exhibited potential neuroprotective activity by reducing oxidative stress and infarction area, and protecting hippocampal CA1 neurons against I/R-injury in the global stroke model in rats.\n",

      "The current study aimed to explore the role of autophagy in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injuries (CIRI) and elucidate the efficacy of liensinine treatment. An in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) neuronal cell model was established and pretreated with liensinine or rapamycin (RAPA). Cell proliferation and survival were detected using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, while cell damage and apoptosis were detected using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage rate and flow cytometry. Autophagy activity was detected using monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining. Thereafter, I/R models were established in vivo in rats and the presence of neurological deficits was examined. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to detect pathological damage in brain tissue and the volume ratio of the cerebral infarction. The levels of PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins and autophagy-related proteins (mTOR, LC3, P62, and TSC2) were detected using Western blot. The findings showed that liensinine treatment increased cell viability, decreased cell injury and apoptosis, and inhibited autophagy. The addition of RAPA to promote autophagy inhibited cell viability and enhanced cell injury and apoptosis. The I/R rats in the model group exhibited deficient neurological function, while those in the liensinine treatment group showed restoration of normal neural function and reduction of the necrotic area and infarct volume ratio in the brain tissue. Furthermore, liensinine treatment also inhibited the PI3K/Akt pathway activity and autophagy. However, addition of RAPA reversed the effects of liensinine treatment and aggravated brain tissue injury. Therefore, liensinine can play a neuroprotective role in CIRI by inhibiting autophagy through regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.\n",

      "Zinc is an important component of cellular antioxidant defenses and dysregulation of zinc homeostasis is a risk factor for coronary heart disease and ischemia/reperfusion injury. Intracellular homeostasis of metals, such as zinc, iron and calcium are interrelated with cellular responses to oxidative stress. Most cells experience significantly lower oxygen levels in vivo (2-10 kPa O2) compared to standard in vitro cell culture (18kPa O2). We report the first evidence that total intracellular zinc content decreases significantly in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), but not in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC), after lowering of O2 levels from hyperoxia (18 kPa O2) to physiological normoxia (5 kPa O2) and hypoxia (1 kPa O2). This was paralleled by O2-dependent differences in redox phenotype based on measurements of glutathione, ATP and NRF2-targeted protein expression in HCAEC and HCASMC. NRF2-induced NQO1 expression was attenuated in both HCAEC and HCASMC under 5 kPa O2 compared to 18 kPa O2. Expression of the zinc efflux transporter ZnT1 increased in HCAEC under 5 kPa O2, whilst expression of the zinc-binding protein metallothionine (MT) decreased as O2 levels were lowered from 18 to 1 kPa O2. Negligible changes in ZnT1 and MT expression were observed in HCASMC. Silencing NRF2 transcription reduced total intracellular zinc under 18 kPa O2 in HCAEC with negligible changes in HCASMC, whilst NRF2 activation or overexpression increased zinc content in HCAEC, but not HCASMC, under 5 kPa O2. This study has identified cell type specific changes in the redox phenotype and metal profile in human coronary artery cells under physiological O2 levels. Our findings provide novel insights into the effect of NRF2 signaling on Zn content and may inform targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases.\n",

The animals received the MCAO operation on day 0. The daily administrations of DK (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o) and edaravone (6 mg/kg, i.v), a reference drug with radical scavenging activity, were started 7 days before (pre-treatment) or immediately after the MCAO operation (post-treatment) and continued during the experimental period. Histochemical, biochemical, and neurological changes and cognitive performance were evaluated. MCAO caused cerebral infarction and neuronal cell loss in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus in a manner accompanied by spatial cognitive deficits. These neurological and cognitive impairments caused by MCAO were significantly attenuated by pre- and post-ischemic treatments with DK and edaravone, suggesting that DK, like edaravone, has therapeutic potential for cerebral ischemia-induced brain damage. DK and edaravone suppressed MCAO-induced changes in biomarkers for apoptosis (TUNEL-positive cell number and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression) and oxidative stress (glutathione and malondialdehyde contents) in the brain. Interestingly, DK, but not edaravone, mitigated an increase in blood-brain permeability and down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor protein expression caused by MCAO. Although the exact chemical constituents implicated in the effects of DK remain to be clarified, the present results indicate that DK exerts neuroprotective and therapeutic activity against transient focal cerebral ischemia-induced injury probably by suppressing oxidative stress, apoptotic process, and mechanisms impairing blood-brain barrier integrity in the brain.\n",

The right middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h followed by reperfusion. The experimental rats were divided into five groups: a sham, or control group; vehicle group; and 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg bodyweight isosakuranetin-treated I/R groups. After 24 h of reperfusion, the rats were tested using a six-point neurological function score. The percentage of cerebral infarction was evaluated using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. BBB leakage was determined by Evan Blue injection assay and brain morphology changes were observed under light microscopy following staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The results of neurological function score revealed that isosakuranetin reduced the severity of neurological damage. A dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg bodyweight of isosakuranetin significantly decreased the infarct volume. All three doses of isosakuranetin significantly decreased Evan Blue leakage. The penumbra area of the I/R brains revealed the characteristics of apoptotic cell death. Therefore, isosakuranetin-treated I/R attenuated the brain damage from cerebral I/R injury and further investigation of the mechanisms warrant further investigation to assist in the development of protective strategies against cerebral I/R injury in clinical trials.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      "Neuroprotective drugs to protect the brain against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury are urgently needed. Mammalian cell-produced recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPOM) has been demonstrated to have excellent neuroprotective functions in preclinical studies, but its neuroprotective properties could not be consistently translated in clinical trials. The clinical failure of rhuEPOM was thought to be mainly due to its erythropoietic activity-associated side effects. To exploit its tissue-protective property, various EPO derivatives with tissue-protective function only have been developed. Among them, asialo-rhuEPO, lacking terminal sialic acid residues, was shown to be neuroprotective but non-erythropoietic. Asialo-rhuEPO can be prepared by enzymatic removal of sialic acid residues from rhuEPOM (asialo-rhuEPOE) or by expressing human EPO gene in glycoengineered transgenic plants (asialo-rhuEPOP). Both types of asialo-rhuEPO, like rhuEPOM, displayed excellent neuroprotective effects by regulating multiple cellular pathways in cerebral I/R animal models. In this review, we describe the structure and properties of EPO and asialo-rhuEPO, summarize the progress on neuroprotective studies of asialo-rhuEPO and rhuEPOM, discuss potential reasons for the clinical failure of rhuEPOM with acute ischemic stroke patients, and advocate future studies needed to develop asialo-rhuEPO as a multimodal neuroprotectant for ischemic stroke treatment.\n",

      "Ischemia and perfusion (I/R) induce inflammation and oxidative stress, which play a notable role in tissue damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) in the protection of the heart from I/R injury. Hearts isolated from Wistar rats (n = 8 per group) were perfused with a modified Langendorff preparation. Left ventricular (LV) contractility and cardiovascular hemodynamics were evaluated by a data acquisition program, and infarct size was evaluated by 2,3,5-Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Furthermore, the effect of apocynin on the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) was evaluated using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Hearts were subjected to 30 min of regional ischemia, produced by ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, followed by 30 min of reperfusion. Hearts were infused with apocynin before ischemia, during ischemia or at reperfusion. To understand the potential pathways of apocynin protection of the heart, a nitric oxide donor (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP), nitric oxide blocker (N (gamma)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, L-Name), nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) inhibiter (Ned-K), cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) agonist, or CD38 blocker (Thiazoloquin (az)olin (on)e compound, 78c) was infused with apocynin. Antioxidants were evaluated by measuring superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity. Apocynin infusion before ischemia or at reperfusion protected the heart by normalizing cardiac hemodynamics and decreasing the infarct size. Apocynin treatment resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and a significant increase (p < 0.05) in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant levels. Apocynin infusion protected the heart by improving LV hemodynamics and coronary vascular dynamics. This treatment decreased the infarct size and inflammatory cytokine levels and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine and antioxidant levels. This protection follows a pathway involving CD38, nitric oxide and acidic stores.\n",

In this paper, the botanical sources, phytochemical characteristics, chemical and biological transformations, pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties, and drug-likeness of SI are reviewed through a comprehensive literature survey, in order to provide support for its further research and applications. In general, SI is mainly distributed in Umbelliferae plants, and it is relatively stable to heat, acid, and oxygen, with good blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Substantial studies have established reliable methods for the isolation, purification, and content determination of SI. Its pharmacological effects include analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-thrombotic, anti-tumor effects, alleviating ischemia-reperfusion injury, etc. Pharmacokinetic parameters indicate that its metabolic pathway is mainly phase Ⅱ metabolism, and it is rapidly absorbed in vivo and widely distributed in the kidneys, liver, and lungs.\n",

      "Procyanidins (PCs), which are organic antioxidants, suppress oxidative stress, exhibit anti-apoptotic properties, and chelate metal ions. The potential defense mechanism of PCs against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) was investigated in this study. Pre-administration for 7 days of a PC enhanced nerve function and decreased cerebellar infarct volume in a mouse middle cerebral artery embolization paradigm. In addition, mitochondrial ferroptosis was enhanced, exhibited by mitochondrial shrinkage and roundness, increased membrane density, and reduced or absent ridges. The level of Fe2+ and lipid peroxidation that cause ferroptosis was significantly reduced by PC administration. According to the Western blot findings, PCs altered the expression of proteins associated with ferroptosis, promoting the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11 while reducing the expression of TFR1, hence inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, the treatment of PCs markedly elevated the expression of HO-1 and Nuclear-Nrf2. The PCs' ability to prevent ferroptosis due to CIRI was decreased by the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. Our findings showed that the protective effect of PCs may be achieved via activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and inhibiting ferroptosis. This study provides a new perspective on the treatment of CIRI with PCs.\n",

      "The mitochondrial splice variant of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR2A-55) is associated with protection from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, increased mitochondrial ATP sensitive K+ channel activity (mitoKATP) and altered glucose metabolism. While mitoKATP channels composed of CCDC51 and ABCB8 exist, the mitochondrial K+ pore regulated by SUR2A-55 is unknown. We explored whether SUR2A-55 regulates ROMK to form an alternate mitoKATP. We assessed glucose uptake in mice overexpressing SUR2A-55 (TGSUR2A-55) compared with WT mice during IR injury. We then examined the expression level of ROMK and the effect of ROMK modulation on mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in WT and TGSUR2A-55 mice. TGSUR2A-55 had increased glucose uptake compared to WT mice during IR injury. The expression of ROMK was similar in WT compared to TGSUR2A-55 mice. ROMK inhibition hyperpolarized resting cardiomyocyte Δψm from TGSUR2A-55 mice but not from WT mice. In addition, TGSUR2A-55 and ROMK inhibitor treated WT isolated cardiomyocytes had enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling. ROMK inhibition blocked diazoxide induced Δψm depolarization and prevented preservation of Δψm from FCCP perfusion in WT and to a lesser degree TGSUR2A-55 mice. In conclusion, cardio-protection from SUR2A-55 is associated with ROMK regulation, enhanced mitochondrial uncoupling and increased glucose uptake.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury causes high disability and mortality. Hydrogen (H2) enhances tolerance to an announced ischemic event; however, the therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of CI/R injury remain uncertain. Long non-coding RNA lincRNA-erythroid prosurvival (EPS) (lincRNA-EPS) regulate various biological processes, but their involvement in the effects of H2 and their associated underlying mechanisms still needs clarification. Herein, we examine the function of the lincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/autophagy pathway in the neuroprotection of H2 against CI/R injury. HT22 cells and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model were used to mimic CI/R injury in vitro. H2, 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor), and RAPA (an autophagy agonist) were then administered, respectively. Autophagy, neuro-proinflammation, and apoptosis were evaluated by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that H2 attenuated HT22 cell injury, which would be confirmed by the improved cell survival rate and decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Furthermore, H2 remarkably improved cell injury after OGD/R insult via decreasing pro-inflammatory factors, as well as suppressing apoptosis. Intriguingly, the protection of H2 against neuronal OGD/R injury was abolished by rapamycin. Importantly, the ability of H2 to promote lincRNA-EPS and Sirt1 expression and inhibit autophagy were abrogated by the siRNA-lincRNA-EPS. Taken together, the findings proved that neuronal cell injury caused by OGD/R is efficiently prevented by H2 via modulating lincRNA-EPS/Sirt1/autophagy-dependent pathway. It was hinted that lincRNA-EPS might be a potential target for the H2 treatment of CI/R injury.\n",

      "Liver transplantation is the only treatment for hepatic insufficiency as a result of acute and chronic liver injuries/pathologies that fail to recover. Unfortunately, there remains an enormous and growing gap between organ supply and demand. Although recipients on the liver transplantation waitlist have significantly higher mortality, livers are often not allocated because they are (i) classified as extended criteria or marginal livers and (ii) subjected to longer cold preservation time (>6 h) with a direct correlation of poor outcomes with longer cold ischemia. Downregulating the recipient's innate immune response to successfully tolerate a graft having longer cold ischemia times or ischemia-reperfusion injury through induction of immune tolerance in the graft and the host would significantly improve organ utilization and post-transplant outcomes. Broadly, technologies proposed for development aim to extend the life of the transplanted liver through post-transplant or recipient conditioning. In this review, we focus on the potential benefits of nanotechnology to provide unique pre-transplant grafting and recipient conditioning of extended criteria donor livers using immune tolerance induction and hyperthermic pre-conditioning.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) in acute coronary syndromes is a condition in which ischemic/hypoxic injury to cells subtended by the occluded vessel continues despite successful resolution of the thrombotic obstruction. For decades, most efforts to attenuate IRI have focused on interdicting singular molecular targets or pathways, but none have successfully transitioned to clinical use. In this work, we investigate a nanoparticle-based therapeutic strategy for profound but local thrombin inhibition that may simultaneously mitigate both thrombosis and inflammatory signaling pathways to limit myocardial IRI. Perfluorocarbon nanoparticles (PFC NP) were covalently coupled with an irreversible thrombin inhibitor, PPACK (Phe[D]-Pro-Arg-Chloromethylketone), and delivered intravenously to animals in a single dose prior to ischemia reperfusion injury. Fluorescent microscopy of tissue sections and 19F magnetic resonance images of whole hearts ex vivo demonstrated abundant delivery of PFC NP to the area at risk. Echocardiography at 24 h after reperfusion demonstrated preserved ventricular structure and improved function. Treatment reduced thrombin deposition, suppressed endothelial activation, inhibited inflammasome signaling pathways, and limited microvascular injury and vascular pruning in infarct border zones. Accordingly, thrombin inhibition with an extraordinarily potent but locally acting agent suggested a critical role for thrombin and a promising therapeutic strategy in cardiac IRI.\n",

      "Reperfusion is the fundamental treatment for ischaemic stroke; however, many ischaemic stroke patients cannot undergo reperfusion treatment. Furthermore, reperfusion can cause ischaemic reperfusion injuries. This study aimed to determine the effects of reperfusion in an in vitro ischaemic stroke model-oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) (0.3% O2)-with rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and cortical neurons. In PC12 cells, OGD resulted in a time-dependent increase in cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and reduction in MTT activity from 2 h onwards. Reperfusion following shorter periods (4 and 6 h) of OGD recovered apoptotic PC12 cells, whereas after 12 h, OGD increased LDH release. In primary neurons, 6 h OGD led to significant increase in cytotoxicity, reduction in MTT activity and dendritic MAP2 staining. Reperfusion following 6 h OGD increased the cytotoxicity. HIF-1a was stabilised by 4 and 6 h OGD in PC12 cells and 2 h OGD onwards in primary neurons. A panel of hypoxic genes were upregulated by the OGD treatments depending on the duration. In conclusion, the duration of OGD determines the mitochondrial activity, cell viability, HIF-1a stabilization, and hypoxic gene expression in both cell types. Reperfusion following OGD of short duration is neuroprotective, whereas OGD of long duration is cytotoxic.\n",

      "In the United States, about one million people are seen to visit the operating theater for cardiac surgery annually. However, nearly half of these visits result in complications such as renal, neurological, and cardiac injury of varying degrees. Historically, many mechanisms and approaches have been explored in attempts to reduce injuries associated with cardiac surgery and percutaneous procedures. Devices such as cardioplegia, mechanical circulatory support, and other methods have shown promising results in managing and preventing life-threatening cardiac-surgery-related outcomes such as heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Comparably, cardioprotective devices such as TandemHeart, Impella family devices, and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) have also been proven to show significant cardioprotection through mechanical support. However, their use as interventional agents in the prevention of hemodynamic changes due to cardiac surgery or percutaneous interventions has been correlated with adverse effects. This can lead to a rebound increased risk of mortality in high-risk patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Further research is necessary to delineate and stratify patients into appropriate cardioprotective device groups. Furthermore, the use of one device over another in terms of efficacy remains controversial and further research is necessary to assess device potential in different settings. Clinical research is also needed regarding novel strategies and targets, such as transcutaneous vagus stimulation and supersaturated oxygen therapy, aimed at reducing mortality among high-risk cardiac surgery patients.

      "Mitochondrial inner membrane protein (Mitofilin/Mic60) is part of a big complex that constituent the mitochondrial inner membrane organizing system (MINOS), which plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial architecture and function. We recently showed that Mitofilin physically binds to Cyclophilin D, and disruption of this interaction promotes the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and determines the extent of I/R injury. Here, we investigated whether Mitofilin knockout in the mouse enhances myocardial injury and inflammation after I/R injury. We found that full-body deletion (homozygote) of Mitofilin induces a lethal effect in the offspring and that a single allele expression of Mitofilin is sufficient to rescue the mouse phenotype in normal conditions. Using non-ischemic hearts from wild-type (WT) and Mitofilin+/- (HET) mice, we report that the mitochondria structure and calcium retention capacity (CRC) required to induce the opening of mPTP were similar in both groups. However, the levels of mitochondrial dynamics proteins involved in both fusion/fission, including MFN2, DRP1, and OPA1, were slightly reduced in Mitofilin+/- mice compared to WT. After I/R, the CRC and cardiac functional recovery were reduced while the mitochondria structure was more damaged, and myocardial infarct size was increased in Mitofilin+/- mice compared to WT. Mitofilin+/- mice exhibited an increase in the mtDNA release in the cytosol and ROS production, as well as dysregulated SLC25As (3, 5, 11, and 22) solute carrier function, compared to WT. In addition, Mitofilin+/- mice displayed an increase in the transcript of pro-inflammatory markers, including IL-6, ICAM, and TNF-α. These results suggest that Mitofilin knockdown induces mitochondrial cristae damage that promotes dysregulation of SLC25As solute carriers, leading to an increase in ROS production and reduction in CRC after I/R. These effects are associated with an increase in the mtDNA release into the cytosol, where it activates signaling cascades leading to nuclear transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines that aggravate I/R injury.\n",

      "Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A main cause of brain damage by stroke is ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury due to the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and energy failure caused by changes in mitochondrial metabolism. Ischemia causes a build-up of succinate in tissues and changes in the mitochondrial NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) activity that promote reverse electron transfer (RET), in which a portion of the electrons derived from succinate are redirected from ubiquinol along complex I to reach the NADH dehydrogenase module of complex I, where matrix NAD+ is converted to NADH and excessive ROS is produced. RET has been shown to play a role in macrophage activation in response to bacterial infection, electron transport chain reorganization in response to changes in the energy supply, and carotid body adaptation to changes in the oxygen levels. In addition to stroke, deregulated RET and RET-generated ROS (RET-ROS) have been implicated in tissue damage during organ transplantation, whereas an RET-induced NAD+/NADH ratio decrease has been implicated in aging, age-related neurodegeneration, and cancer. In this review, we provide a historical account of the roles of ROS and oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, summarize the latest developments in our understanding of RET biology and RET-associated pathological conditions, and discuss new ways to target ischemic stroke, cancer, aging, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases by modulating RET.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) often impairs the function of other organs leading to distant organ injury. The liver is the major organ that regulates metabolism and lipid homeostasis in the body. It has been reported that AKI causes liver injury with increased oxidative stress, inflammatory response and steatosis. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms by which ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI caused hepatic lipid accumulation. Kidney ischemia (45 min)-reperfusion (24 h) led to a significant increase in plasma creatinine and transaminase in Sprague Dawley rats, indicating kidney and liver injury. Histological and biochemical analyses revealed hepatic lipid accumulation with a significant elevation of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the liver. This was accompanied by a decreased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, indicating the reduced activation of AMPK, which is an energy sensor that regulates lipid metabolism. The expression of AMPK-regulated genes that were responsible for fatty acid oxidation (CPTIα, ACOX) was significantly decreased, while the expression of lipogenesis genes (SREPB-1c, ACC1) was significantly elevated. The oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde was elevated in the plasma and liver. Incubation of HepG2 cells with an oxidative stress inducer hydrogen peroxide inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and caused cellular lipid accumulation. This was accompanied by decreased expression of genes responsible for fatty acid oxidation and increased expression of genes responsible for lipogenesis. These results suggest that AKI elicits hepatic lipid accumulation through decreased fatty acid metabolism and increased lipogenesis. Oxidative stress may contribute, in part, to the downregulation of the AMPK signaling pathway leading to hepatic lipid accumulation and injury.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) events are involved in the development of various ocular pathologies, e.g., retinal artery or vein occlusion. We tested the hypothesis that resveratrol is protective against I/R injury in the murine retina. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was elevated in anaesthetized mice to 110 mm Hg for 45 min via a micropipette placed in the anterior chamber to induce ocular ischemia. In the fellow eye, which served as control, IOP was kept at a physiological level. One group received resveratrol (30 mg/kg/day p.o. once daily) starting one day before the I/R event, whereas the other group of mice received vehicle solution only. On day eight after the I/R event, mice were sacrificed and retinal wholemounts were prepared and immuno-stained using a Brn3a antibody to quantify retinal ganglion cells. Reactivity of retinal arterioles was measured in retinal vascular preparations using video microscopy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) were quantified in ocular cryosections by dihydroethidium and anti-3-nitrotyrosine staining, respectively. Moreover, hypoxic, redox and nitric oxide synthase gene expression was quantified in retinal explants by PCR. I/R significantly diminished retinal ganglion cell number in vehicle-treated mice. Conversely, only a negligible reduction in retinal ganglion cell number was observed in resveratrol-treated mice following I/R. Endothelial function and autoregulation were markedly reduced, which was accompanied by increased ROS and RNS in retinal blood vessels of vehicle-exposed mice following I/R, whereas resveratrol preserved vascular endothelial function and autoregulation and blunted ROS and RNS formation. Moreover, resveratrol reduced I/R-induced mRNA expression for the prooxidant enzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2 (NOX2). Our data provide evidence that resveratrol protects from I/R-induced retinal ganglion cell loss and endothelial dysfunction in the murine retina by reducing nitro-oxidative stress possibly via suppression of NOX2 upregulation.\n",

      "Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP) leading to repetitive ischemia and reperfusion (IR) stress, is the first recognizable sign of systemic sclerosis (SSc) leading to increased oxidative stress. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear factor released by apoptotic and necrotic cells after oxidative stress. Since HMGB1 can signal through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), we investigated whether an RP attack promotes the release of HMGB1, leading to fibroblast activation and the upregulation of interferon (IFN)-inducible genes. A cold challenge was performed to simulate an RP attack in patients with SSc, primary RP (PRP), and healthy controls. We measured levels of HMGB1 and IFN gamma-induced Protein 10 (IP-10) at different time points in the serum. Digital perfusion was assessed by photoplethysmography. In vitro, HMGB1 or transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) (as control) was used to stimulate healthy human dermal fibroblasts. Inflammatory, profibrotic, and IFN-inducible genes, were measured by RT-qPCR. In an independent cohort, sera were obtained from 20 patients with SSc and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls to determine HMGB1 and IP-10 levels. We found that HMGB1 levels increased significantly 30 min after the cold challenge in SSc compared to healthy controls. In vitro stimulation with HMGB1 resulted in increased mRNA expression of IP-10, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) while TGF-β1 stimulation promoted IL-6 and Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF). In serum, both HMGB1 and IP-10 levels were significantly higher in patients with SSc compared to healthy controls. We show that cold challenge leads to the release of HMGB1 in SSc patients. HMGB1 induces IP-10 expression in dermal fibroblasts partly through the soluble RAGE (sRAGE) axis suggesting a link between RP attacks, the release of HMGB1 and IFN-induced proteins as a putative early pathogenetic mechanism in SSc.\n",

      "Metabolic stress and the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two main contributors to neuronal damage and synaptic plasticity in acute ischemic stroke. The superoxide scavenger MnTMPyP has been previously reported to have a neuroprotective effect in organotypic hippocampal slices and to modulate synaptic transmission after in vitro hypoxia and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). However, the mechanisms involved in the effect of this scavenger remain elusive. In this study, two concentrations of MnTMPyP were evaluated on synaptic transmission during ischemia and post-ischemic synaptic potentiation. The complex molecular changes supporting cellular adaptation to metabolic stress, and how these are modulated by MnTMPyP, were also investigated. Electrophysiological data showed that MnTMPyP causes a decrease in baseline synaptic transmission and impairment of synaptic potentiation. Proteomic analysis performed on MnTMPyP and hypoxia-treated tissue indicated an impairment in vesicular trafficking mechanisms, including reduced expression of Hsp90 and actin signalling. Alterations of vesicular trafficking may lead to reduced probability of neurotransmitter release and AMPA receptor activity, resulting in the observed modulatory effect of MnTMPyP. In OGD, protein enrichment analysis highlighted impairments in cell proliferation and differentiation, such as TGFβ1 and CDKN1B signalling, in addition to downregulation of mitochondrial dysfunction and an increased expression of CAMKII. Taken together, our results may indicate modulation of neuronal sensitivity to the ischemic insult, and a complex role for MnTMPyP in synaptic transmission and plasticity, potentially providing molecular insights into the mechanisms mediating the effects of MnTMPyP during ischemia.\n",

      "Succinate is enhanced during initial reperfusion in blood from the coronary sinus in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients and in pigs submitted to transient coronary occlusion. Succinate levels might have a prognostic value, as they may correlate with edema volume or myocardial infarct size. However, blood from the coronary sinus is not routinely obtained in the CathLab. As succinate might be also increased in peripheral blood, we aimed to investigate whether peripheral plasma concentrations of succinate and other metabolites obtained during coronary revascularization correlate with edema volume or infarct size in STEMI patients. Plasma samples were obtained from peripheral blood within the first 10 min of revascularization in 102 STEMI patients included in the COMBAT-MI trial (initial TIMI 1) and from 9 additional patients with restituted coronary blood flow (TIMI 2). Metabolite concentrations were analyzed by 1H-NMR. Succinate concentration averaged 0.069 ± 0.0073 mmol/L in patients with TIMI flow ≤ 1 and was significantly increased in those with TIMI 2 at admission (0.141 ± 0.058 mmol/L, p < 0.05). However, regression analysis did not detect any significant correlation between most metabolite concentrations and infarct size, extent of edema or other cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) variables. In conclusion, spontaneous reperfusion in TIMI 2 patients associates with enhanced succinate levels in peripheral blood, suggesting that succinate release increases overtime following reperfusion. However, early plasma levels of succinate and other metabolites obtained from peripheral blood does not correlate with the degree of irreversible injury or area at risk in STEMI patients, and cannot be considered as predictors of CMR variables.Trial registration: Registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02404376) on 31/03/2015.

      "Autologous skin flap transplantation is a common method for repairing complex soft tissue defects caused by cancer, trauma, and congenital malformations. Limited blood supply range and post-transplantation ischemia-reperfusion injury can lead to distal necrosis of the flap and long-term functional loss, which severely restricts the decision-making regarding the optimal surgical plan. To address this issue, we develop a hydrogel patch that releases carbon monoxide and nitric oxide gases on demand, to afford a timely blood supply for skin flap transplantation during surgery. Using an ischemia-reperfusion dorsal skin flap model in rats, we show that the hydrogel patch maintains the immediate opening of blood flow channels in transplanted tissue and effective blood perfusion throughout the perioperative period, activating perfusion of the hemodynamic donor site. We demonstrate that the hydrogel patch promotes distal vascularization and long-term functional reconstruction of transplanted tissues by inhibiting inflammatory damage and accelerating blood vessel formation.\n",

The expense associated with surgery is typically less with early lesion correction. The challenge is making an early diagnosis of intestinal strangulation. Although for some horses with a strangulating obstruction, the need for surgery is made based on severe colic signs or lack of response to analgesia, in other horses, it is less obvious. Signalment, history, and meticulous physical examination, combined with some targeted diagnostic procedures can help with early diagnosis of intestinal strangulation. Improving the outcome of these horses requires diligence and a team-based approach from the owner or caregiver, primary care veterinarian, and specialists.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a critical liver condition during hepatic transplantation, trauma, or shock. An ischemic deprivation of antioxidants and energy characterizes liver injury in such cases. In the face of increased reactive oxygen production, hepatocytes are vulnerable to the reperfusion driving ROS generation and multiple cell-death mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the importance of hydrogen sulfide as part of the liver's antioxidant pool and the therapeutic potency of the hydrogen sulfide donors sodium sulfide (Na2S, fast releasing) and sodium thiosulfate (STS, Na2S2O3, slow releasing). The mitoprotection and toxicity of STS and Na2S were investigated on isolated mitochondria and a liver perfusion oxidative stress model by adding text-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen sulfide donors. The respiratory capacity of mitochondria, hepatocellular released LDH, glutathione, and lipid-peroxide levels were quantified. In addition, wild-type and cystathionine-γ-lyase knockout mice were subjected to warm selective ischemia-reperfusion injury by clamping the main inflow for 1 h followed by reperfusion of 1 or 24 h. A subset of animals was treated with STS shortly before reperfusion. Glutathione, plasma ALT, and lipid-peroxide levels were investigated alongside mitochondrial changes in structure (electron microscopy) and function (intravital microscopy). Liver tissue necrosis quantified 24 h after reperfusion indicates the net effects of the treatment on the organ. STS refuels and protects the endogenous antioxidant pool during liver ischemia-reperfusion injury. In addition, STS-mediated ROS scavenging significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial damage, resulting in better molecular and histopathological preservation of the liver tissue architecture. STS prevents tissue damage in liver ischemia-reperfusion injury by increasing the liver's antioxidant pool, thereby protecting mitochondrial integrity.\n",

      "Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has been proved to promote functional rehabilitation of brain lesions including ischemic stroke. However, the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation are limited by the low survival and differentiation rates of NSCs due to the harsh environment in the brain after ischemic stroke. Here, we employed NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells together with exosomes extracted from NSCs to treat cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion in mice. The results showed that NSC-derived exosomes significantly reduced the inflammatory response, alleviated oxidative stress after NSC transplantation, and facilitated NSCs differentiation in vivo. The combination of NSCs with exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarction, neuronal death, and glial scarring, and promoted the recovery of motor function. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of NSC-derived exosomes and the potential downstream genes.

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the rapid reduction in renal function. It is often difficult to detect at an early stage. Biofluid microRNAs (miRs) have been proposed as novel biomarkers due to their regulatory role in renal pathophysiology. The goal of this study was to determine the overlap in AKI miRNA profiles in the renal cortex, urine, and plasma samples collected from a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI. Bilateral renal ischemia was induced by clamping the renal pedicles for 30 min, followed by reperfusion. Urine was then collected over 24 h, followed by terminal blood and tissue collection for small RNA profiling. Differentially expressed (IR vs. sham) miRs within the urine and renal cortex sample types demonstrated a strong correlation in normalized abundance regardless of injury (IR and sham: R2 = 0.8710 and 0.9716, respectively). Relatively few miRs were differentially expressed in multiple samples. Further, there were no differentially expressed miRs with clinically relevant sequence conservation common between renal cortex and urine samples. This project highlights the need for a comprehensive analysis of potential miR biomarkers, including analysis of pathological tissues and biofluids, with the goal of identifying the cellular origin of altered miRs.

      "In neonates, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious condition involving oxidative stress and inflammation. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a potentially useful technique to protect distant organs from the damage induced by ischemia. RIC has been verified as effective to protect against NEC; however, its mechanism is unclear. This study aimed to assess the mechanism and efficacy of RIC to treat experimental NEC in mice. Between postnatal day (P) 5 and P9, we induced NEC in C57BL/6 mice and Grx1-/- mice. Intermittent occlusion of the blood flow to the right hind limb for 4 cycles of 5 min ischemia followed by 5 min reperfusion during NEC induction on P6 and P8 was used to apply RIC. We sacrificed the mice on p9 and evaluated oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines, proliferation, apoptosis, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway in mice ileal tissue. RIC decreased intestinal injury and prolonged survival in NEC pups. RIC significantly inhibited inflammatory, attenuated oxidative stress, reduced apoptosis, promoted proliferation, and activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR in vivo. RIC activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to control oxidative stress and inflammation. RIC might provide a new therapeutic strategy for NEC.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a disease process that affects several vital organs. There is widespread agreement that the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway plays a crucial role in the development of I/R injury. We have developed transferrin-conjugated, pH-responsive nanomicelles for the entrapment of MCC950 drug. These nanomicelles specifically bind to the transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) expressed on the cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thus help the cargo to cross the BBB. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of nanomicelles was assessed using in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo models of I/R injury. Nanomicelles were injected into the common carotid artery (CCA) of a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model to achieve maximum accretion of nanomicelles into the brain as blood flows toward the brain in the CCA. The current study reveals that the treatment with nanomicelles significantly alleviates the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome biomarkers which were found to be increased in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated SH-SY5Y cells, the I/R-damaged right vitelline artery (RVA) of chick embryos, and the MCAO rat model. The supplementation with nanomicelles significantly enhanced the overall survival of MCAO rats. Overall, nanomicelles exerted therapeutic effects against I/R injury, which might be due to the suppression of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.\n",

      "Renal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common renal functional disorder with high morbidity and mortality. Stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING) is the cytosolic DNA-activated signaling pathway that mediates inflammation and injury. Our recent study showed that extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP), a newly identified damage-associated molecular pattern, activates STING and exacerbates hemorrhagic shock. H151 is a small molecule that selectively binds to STING and inhibits STING-mediated activity. We hypothesized that H151 attenuates eCIRP-induced STING activation in vitro and inhibits RIR-induced AKI in vivo. In vitro, renal tubular epithelial cells incubated with eCIRP showed increased levels of IFN-β, STING pathway downstream cytokine, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, whereas coincubation with eCIRP and H151 diminished those increases in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, 24 h after bilateral renal ischemia-reperfusion, glomerular filtration rate was decreased in RIR-vehicle-treated mice, whereas glomerular filtration rate was unchanged in RIR-H151-treated mice. In contrast to sham, serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were increased in RIR-vehicle, but in RIR-H151, these levels were significantly decreased from RIR-vehicle. In contrast to sham, kidney IFN-β mRNA, histological injury score, and TUNEL staining were also increased in RIR-vehicle, but in RIR-H151, these levels were significantly decreased from RIR-vehicle. Importantly, in contrast to sham, in a 10-day survival study, survival decreased to 25% in RIR-vehicle, but RIR-H151 had a survival of 63%. In conclusion, H151 inhibits eCIRP-induced STING activation in renal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, STING inhibition by H151 can be a promising therapeutic intervention for RIR-induced AKI.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Renal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR)-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common renal functional disorder with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is the cytosolic DNA-activated signaling pathway responsible for mediating inflammation and injury.

      "How to reduce the damage caused by myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in a timely manner to save patients' lives is still a great clinical challenge. Although dexmedetomidine (DEX) has been reported to protect the myocardium, the regulatory mechanism of gene translation responding to IR injury and DEX protection is poorly understood. In this study, IR rat model with DEX and the antagonist yohimbine (YOH) pretreatment were established, and RNA sequencing was carried out to seek the important regulators in differential expressed genes. A series of cytokines and chemokine as well as eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (EEF1A2) were induced by IR compared to control and compromised by DEX pretreatment compared to IR, then reversed by YOH. Immunoprecipitation was conducted to identify that peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) interacted with EEF1A2 and contributed to the recruitment of EEF1A2 on mRNA molecules of cytokines and chemokine. Knockdown of PRDX1 could weaken the enhancive effect of EEF1A2 for gene translation of IL6, CXCL2 and CXCL11 under the IR condition, and indeed reduce cell apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. We also determined that the RNA motif \"USCAGDCU\" at 5' UTR could be particularly recognized by PRDX1. Destruction of this motif at the 5' UTR of IL6, CXCL2 and CXCL11 by CRISPR-CAS9 could result in the loss occupancies of EEF1A2 and PRDX1 on the mRNA of these three genes. Our observations showed the importance of PRDX1 in the reasonable control of cytokine and chemokine expression to prevent excessive inflammatory response to cell damage.\n",

      "Intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH), a reperfusion therapy-associated complication, is the extravasation of red blood cells caused by severe microvascular injury. IMH is an independent predictor of adverse ventricular remodeling (AVR) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Hepcidin, a major regulator of iron uptake and systemic distribution, is a key factor affecting AVR. However, the role of cardiac hepcidin in the development of IMH has not been completely elucidated. This study aimed to explore if sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) exerts therapeutic effects on IMH and AVR by suppressing hepcidin and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. SGLT2i alleviated IMH and AVR in the ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) mouse model. Additionally, SGLT2i downregulated the cardiac levels of hepcidin in IRI mice, suppressed M1-type macrophage polarization, and promoted M2-type macrophage polarization. The effects of hepcidin knockdown on macrophage polarization were similar to those of SGLT2i in RAW264.7 cells. SGLT2i treatment or hepcidin knockdown inhibited the expression of MMP9, an inducer of IMH and AVR, in RAW264.7 cells. Regulation of macrophage polarization and reduction of MMP9 expression by SGLT2i and hepcidin knockdown is achieved through activation of pSTAT3. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that SGLT2i alleviated IMH and AVR by regulating macrophage polarization. The potential mechanism through which SGLT2i exerted its therapeutic effect seems to involve the downregulation of MMP9 via the hepcidin-STAT3 pathway.\n",

      "Apoptotic vesicles (ApoVs) hold great promise for inflammatory regulation and tissue repair. However, little effort has been dedicated to developing ApoV-based drug delivery platforms, while the insufficient targeting capability of ApoVs also limits their clinical applications. This work presents a platform architecture that integrates apoptosis induction, drug loading, and functionalized proteome regulation, followed by targeting modification, enabling the creation of an apoptotic vesicle delivery system to treat ischemic stroke. Briefly, α-mangostin (α-M) was utilized to induce mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) apoptosis while being loaded onto MSC-derived ApoVs as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Matrix metalloproteinase activatable cell-penetrating peptide (MAP), a microenvironment-responsive targeting peptide, was modified on the surface of ApoVs to obtain the MAP-functionalized α-M-loaded ApoVs. Such engineered ApoVs targeted the injured ischemic brain after systemic injection and achieved an enhanced neuroprotective activity due to the synergistic effect of ApoVs and α-M. The internal protein payloads of ApoVs, upon α-M activation, were found engaged in regulating immunological response, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation, all of which contributed to the therapeutic effects of ApoVs. The findings provide a universal framework for creating ApoV-based therapeutic drug delivery systems for the amelioration of inflammatory diseases and demonstrate the potential of MSC-derived ApoVs to treat neural injury.\n",

      "Oxidative stress is considered a key factor contributing to the initiation and development of cardiac injury following ischaemia‒reperfusion (I/R). Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is a rate-limiting enzyme for leukotriene biosynthesis. MK-886 is an inhibitor of ALOX5 that exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. However, the significance of MK-886 in preventing I/R-mediated cardiac injury and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Cardiac I/R model was produced by ligation/release of the left anterior descending artery. MK-886 (20 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally into mice at 1 and 24 h before I/R. Our results indicated that MK-886 treatment significantly attenuated I/R-mediated cardiac contractile dysfunction and decreased the infarct area, myocyte apoptosis, and oxidative stress accompanied with reduction of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (keap1) and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). Conversely, administration of the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin and NRF2 inhibitor ML385 greatly abrogated MK-886-mediated cardioprotection after I/R injury. Mechanistically, MK-886 enhanced the expression of the immunoproteasome subunit β5i, which interacted with keap1 and enhanced its degradation, leading to activation of the NRF2-dependent antioxidant response and improvement of mitochondrial fusion-fission balance in the I/R-treated heart. In summary, our present findings indicated that MK-886 could protect the heart against I/R injury and highlight that MK-886 may represent a promising therapeutic candidate for preventing ischaemic disease.\n",

      "Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation is a deleterious molecular mechanism that drives acute kidney injury (AKI) and manifests in transplanted kidneys as delayed graft function. The TNFAIP3 gene encodes A20, a cytoplasmic ubiquitin ligase and a master negative regulator of the NF- κB signaling pathway. Common population-specific TNFAIP3 coding variants that reduce A20's enzyme function and increase NF- κB activation have been linked to heightened protective immunity and autoimmune disease, but have not been investigated in AKI. Here, we functionally identified a series of unique human TNFAIP3 coding variants linked to the autoimmune genome-wide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms of F127C; namely F127C;R22Q, F127C;G281E, F127C;W448C and F127C;N449K that reduce A20's anti-inflammatory function in an NF- κB reporter assay. To investigate the impact of TNFAIP3 hypomorphic coding variants in AKI we tested a mouse Tnfaip3 hypomorph in a model of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). The mouse Tnfaip3 coding variant I325N increases NF- κB activation without overt inflammatory disease, providing an immune boost as I325N mice exhibit enhanced innate immunity to a bacterial challenge. Surprisingly, despite exhibiting increased intra-kidney NF- κB activation with inflammation in IRI, the kidney of I325N mice was protected. The I325N variant influenced the outcome of IRI by changing the dynamic expression of multiple cytoprotective mechanisms, particularly by increasing NF- κB-dependent anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2, BCL-XL, c-FLIP and A20, altering the active redox state of the kidney with a reduction of superoxide levels and the enzyme super oxide dismutase-1, and enhancing cellular protective mechanisms including increased Foxp3+ T cells. Thus, TNFAIP3 gene variants represent a kidney and population-specific molecular factor that can dictate the course of IRI.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/RI) may potentiate cardiac remodeling and heart failure, while effective therapies for I/RI remain lacking. Circulating human plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (hEV) have great potential to protect against I/RI. However, the effective delivery of hEV in vivo remains a limiting factor for clinical application. The present study constructs a biomimetic delivery system of platelet membrane-fused hEV (P-hEV), utilizing the natural affinity of platelets for hEV delivery to the injured vascular and myocardial sites. The results show that platelet membrane and hEV membrane fusion can be achieved through repeated extrusion. Compared to non-modified hEV, P-hEV uptake is greatly enhanced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) stressed by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Functionally, P-hEV inhibits HUVEC and neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRCM) apoptosis and promotes HUVECs migration and tube formation under OGD/R stress in vitro. Intravenous delivery of P-hEV more effectively targets and accumulates at injury sites in the heart. Furthermore, P-hEV significantly enhances protection against acute I/RI and attenuates cardiac remodeling at three weeks post-I/RI. In conclusion, the platelet membrane-fused hEV delivery system enhances the target delivery of EV to protect against myocardial I/RI, presenting a novel drug delivery system for ischemic heart diseases.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) was often observed after surgeries, causing a lot of suffering to patients. Inflammation and apoptosis were critical determinants during MIRI. We conveyed experiments to reveal the regulatory functions of circHECTD1 in MIRI development. The Rat MIRI model was established and determined by 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. We analyzed cell apoptosis using TUNEL and flow cytometry. Proteins expression was evaluated by western blot. The RNA level was determined by qRT-PCR. Secreted inflammatory factors were analyzed by ELISA assay. To predict the interaction sequences on circHECTD1, miR-138-5p, and ROCK2, bioinformatics analysis was performed. Dual-luciferase assay was used to confirm these interaction sequences. CircHECTD1 and ROCK2 were upregulated in the rat MIRI model, while miR-138-5p was decreased. CircHECTD1 knockdown alleviated H/R-induced inflammation in H9c2 cells. Direct interaction and regulation of circHECTD1/miR-138-5p and miR-138-5p/ROCK2 were confirmed by dual-luciferase assay. CircHECTD1 promoted H/R-induced inflammation and cell apoptosis by inhibiting miR-138-5p. miR-138-5p alleviated H/R-induced inflammation, while ectopic ROCK2 antagonized such effect of miR-138-5p. Our research suggested that the circHECTD1-modulated miR-138-5p suppressing is responsible for ROCK2 activation during H/R-induced inflammatory response, providing a novel insight into MIRI-associated inflammation.\n",

Here, we examined the development of ischemic injury in young (9-12-week-old) and adult (72-week-old) C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice exposed to 30 min of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Post-ischemic reperfusion did not differ between young and adult mice. Ischemic injury assessed by infarct area and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity assessed by IgG extravasation analysis was smaller in adult compared with young mice. Microvascular viability and neuronal survival assessed by CD31 and NeuN immunohistochemistry were higher in adult than young mice. Tissue protection was associated with stronger activation of cell survival pathways in adult than young mice. Microglial/macrophage accumulation and activation assessed by F4/80 immunohistochemistry were more restricted in adult than young mice, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses were reduced by aging. By means of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we identified a hitherto unknown proteome profile comprising the upregulation of glycogen degradation-related pathways and the downregulation of mitochondrial dysfunction-related pathways, which distinguished post-ischemic responses of the aged compared with the young brain.

Compared to patients receiving intravenous rt-PA alone, those receiving intravenous rt-PA combined with SAFI had a higher likelihood of achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months. In addition, the use of SAFI for 2 weeks was associated with better neurological recovery. The evidence of benefit was confirmed by trial sequential analysis (TSA). The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage did not differ between the two groups. In patients with AIS, intravenous rt-PA combined with SAFI might achieve better functional outcomes.

LP342 treatment (1 mg/kg, ip) at 20 h or 1 h before ischaemia markedly decreased IRI whereas LP342 treatment upon reperfusion was marginally protective. Nitro-oxidative stress, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to IRI. 4-Hydroxynonenal, 3-nitrotyrosine, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), JNK activation and Sab binding increased markedly after IR, which LP342 blunted. LP342 also induced thioredoxin-1 expression before and after IR. LP342 also decreased mitochondrial depolarisation as detected by intravital microscopy at 2 h after IR. Lastly, LP342 increased acetylation of both histone-3 (class I HDAC substrate) and NFκB p65 but not tubulin (class II HDAC substrate) before and after IR.\n",

The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of a calpain inhibitor in CIRI using a rat model of CA. CA was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, and MDL28170 (a calpain inhibitor) was administered to the rats within 30 min after the return of spontaneous circulation. Differences between groups were evaluated by measuring survival rate, CPR duration and neurological deficit score. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Nissl staining were performed to assess cerebral injury, and microstructure and autophagy were assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The levels of calpain-1, calpain-2, calpastatin, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, P62, beclin-1 and LC3 in the brain tissues were determined using western blotting and double immunofluorescence staining. There was no significant difference in CPR duration or survival rate among the groups. At 24 h after CPR, the CA group demonstrated damaged tissue morphology; decreased neurological deficit scores, and P62 expression; and upregulated calpain-2, IL-1βp17, TNF-α, beclin-1 and LC3 levels in the cortex. However, MDL28170 improved neuronal function and suppressed inflammation and autophagy by inhibiting calpain-2 level, but there were no differences in the calpain-1 and calpastatin levels. These results suggest that calpain-2, inflammation and autophagy are involved in CA-induced CIRI. MDL28170 inhibited calpain-2 expression, inflammation and autophagy, which suggests its potential efficacy in treating post-CA nerve damage.\n",

It is associated with abnormal glutathione metabolism, lipid peroxidation and iron metabolism, and is involved in the occurrence and development of various diseases. Studies have found that ferroptosis plays an important role in hypoxia-associated brain injury.

      "To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of establishing porcine ischemia-reperfusion models by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, we first randomly divided 16 male Bama pigs into a sham group and a model group. After anesthesia, we separated the arteries and veins. Subsequently, we rapidly located the LAD coronary artery at the beginning of its first diagonal branch through a mid-chest incision. Then, we loosened and released the ligation line after five minutes of pre-occlusion. Finally, we ligated the LAD coronary artery in situ two minutes later and loosened the ligature 60 min after ischemia. Compared with the sham group, electrocardiogram showed multiple continuous lead ST-segment elevations, and ultrasound cardiogram showed significantly lower ejection fraction and left ventricular fractional shortening at one hour and seven days post-operation in the model group. Twenty-four hours after the operation, cardiac troponin T and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme levels significantly increased in the model group, compared with the sham group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed the presence of many inflammatory cells infiltrating the interstitium of the myocardium in the model group but not in the sham group. Masson staining revealed a significant increase in infarct size in the ischemia/reperfusion group. All eight pigs in the model group recovered with normal sinus heart rates, and the survival rate was 100%. In conclusion, the method can provide an accurate and stable large animal model for preclinical research on ischemia/reperfusion with a high success rate and homogeneity of the myocardial infarction area.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a complex pathological condition with high mortality. In particular, reperfusion can stimulate overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of inflammation, causing severe secondary injuries to the brain. Despite tremendous efforts, it remains urgent to rationally design antioxidative agents with straightforward and efficient ROS scavenging capability. Herein, a potent antioxidative agent was explored based on iridium oxide nano-agglomerates (Tf-IrO2 NAs) via the facile transferrin (Tf)-templated biomineralization approach, and innovatively applied to treat CIRI. Containing some small-size IrO2 aggregates, these NAs possess intrinsic hydroxyl radicals (•OH)-scavenging ability and multifarious enzyme activities, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Moreover, they also showed improved blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and enhanced accumulation in the ischemic brain via Tf receptor-mediated transcytosis. Therefore, Tf-IrO2 NAs achieved robust in vitro anti-inflammatory and cytoprotection effects against oxidative stress. Importantly, mice were effectively protected against CIRI by enhanced ROS scavenging activity in vivo, and the therapeutic mechanism was systematically verified. These findings broaden the idea of expanding Ir-based NAs as potent antioxidative agents to treat CIRI and other ROS-mediated diseases. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: (1) The ROS-scavenging activities of IrO2 are demonstrated comprehensively, which enriched the family of nano-antioxidants. (2) The engineering Tf-IrO2 nano-agglomerates present unique multifarious enzyme activities and simultaneous transferrin targeting and BBB crossing ability for cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury therapy. (3) This work may open an avenue to enable the use of IrO2 to alleviate ROS-mediated inflammatory and brain injury diseases.\n",

      "To observe the regulation of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Beclin 1 interaction through electroacupuncture (EA) intervention during reperfusion and to investigate the EA mechanism of apoptosis-autophagy interactive regulation against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI). A total of 48 adult Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the sham-operated group (group Sham), the model group (group Model), the EA group (group EA), and the JNK inhibitor (SP600125) group (group JNK), with 12 rats in each group. Biospecimens were collected randomly from six rats in each group four hours after reperfusion. Evans Blue and triphenyl tetrazolium chloride double-staining were applied to observe each group's myocardial damage area and risk area. We collected 4 ml of blood by abdominal aortic method to detect serum troponin cTnI level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the remaining six in each group, a part of myocardial tissue below the ligation line was stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining; the other amount of myocardial tissue was detected by Western blotting to determine the expression levels of Bcl-2, Beclin1, and the phosphorylation levels of Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 in Bcl-2. In results: electroacupuncture (EA) intervention during reperfusion significantly reduced the myocardial infarction area, cTnI level, and myocardial apoptosis, upregulated Bcl-2 expression, downregulated Beclin 1 expression and inhibited phosphorylation levels of Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 in Bcl-2. We concluded that EA effectively inhibited apoptosis by upregulating Bcl-2 expression and inhibiting the phosphorylation of Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 in Bcl-2. This reduced the separation of Bcl-2 and Beclin 1, restrains excessive autophagy, alleviates MIRI, and has a protective effect on myocardial tissue.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) is a serious obstacle for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) to benefit from post-ischemic reflow. The low immunogenicity and low carcinogenicity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes (exo) offer advantage in treating myocardial injuries. Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is an effective drug for MI/RI treatment. However, the underlying mechanism and targets remain obscure. In this study, we systematically investigated the therapeutic effect and its mechanism of TSA-pretreated MSC-derived exosomes (TSA-MSCexo) in ameliorating MI/RI in rats. Expectedly, the MI/RI was significantly relieved by TSA-MSCexo compared with MSCexo. Moreover, the overexpression of CCR2 in rats' heart was used to determine CCR2 had a regulatory effect on monocyte infiltration and angiogenesis after MI/RI. MiRNA microarray analysis of MSCexo and TSA-MSCexo revealed miR-223-5p an effective candidate mediator for TSA-MSCexo to exert its cardioprotective function and CCR2 as the downstream target. In summary, our findings indicated that miR-223-5p packaged in TSA-MSCexo inhibited CCR2 activation to reduce monocyte infiltration and enhanced angiogenesis to alleviate MI/RI. Thus, the development of cell free therapies for exosomes derived from the combination TSA and MSC provides an effective strategy for the clinical therapies of ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n",

We found that LPS promoted the cerebral I/R-induced A1 astrocytes proliferation in mouse hippocampal tissues and deteriorated the reduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) content in mouse sera, H2S donor NaHS could inhibit A1 astrocytes proliferation. Similarly, knockout of cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), one of endogenous H2S synthases, likewise up-regulated the cerebral I/R-induced A1 astrocytes proliferation, which could also be blocked by NaHS. Besides, supplement with H2S promoted the A2 astrocytes proliferation in hippocampal tissues of CSE knockout (CSE KO) mice or LPS-treated mice following cerebral I/R. In the oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model of astrocytes, H2S also promoted the transformation of astrocytes into A2 subtype. Moreover, we found that H2S could up-regulate the expression of α-subunit of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels in astrocytes, and the channel opener BMS-191011 likewise promoted the transformation of astrocyte into A2 subtype. In conclusion, H2S inhibits the proliferation of A1 astrocytes induced by LPS-based neuroinflammation following cerebral I/R and promotes the transformation of astrocytes into A2 subtype, which may be related to up-regulation of BKCa channels.\n",

      "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most challenging clinical problems in kidney disease due to serious complications and high mortality rate, which can lead to acute lung injury (ALI) through inflammatory reactions and oxidative stress. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has been reported to be involved in the development of renal ischemia-reperfusion through autophagy and it remains unclear whether AMPK/mTOR pathway has an effect on the AKI-induced ALI. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of autophagy-related AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway on inflammatory factors and oxidative stress in an AKI-induced ALI model. The 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups randomly: (i) sham, (ii) ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), (iii) IRI + rapamycin (RA), and (iv) IRI + 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Unilateral flank incisions were made and right kidneys were excised. The left kidney was subjected to 60 min of ischemia followed by 12, 24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion. The levels of Scr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Wet/Dry ratio, indexes of inflammation, and oxidative stress were assayed. Histological examinations were performed. The protein expression of AMPK, mTOR, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, and Beclin-1, ULK1 was evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Compared to the rats from the sham group, IRI rats showed significantly pulmonary damage after AKI with increased Scr, BUN, Wet/Dry ratio, indexes of inflammation, and oxidative stress. The expression of AMPK, LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, Beclin-1, and ULK1 and were increased, while p62 and mTOR were decreased. In addition, RA treatment significantly attenuated lung injury by promoting autophagy through the activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and 3-MA treatment exhibited adverse effects inversely. Therefore, the activation of the AMPK/mTOR pathway after renal IRI induction could significantly attenuate kidney injury and following AKI-induced ALI by inducing autophagy, which alienates inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.\n",

      "The liver displays a remarkable regenerative capacity in response to acute liver injury. In addition to the proliferation of hepatocytes during liver regeneration, non-parenchymal cells, including liver macrophages, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play critical roles in liver repair and regeneration. Liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major cause of increased liver damage during liver resection, transplantation, and trauma. Impaired liver repair increases postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients who underwent liver surgery. Successful liver repair and regeneration after liver IRI requires coordinated interplay and synergic actions between hepatic resident cells and recruited cell components. However, the underlying mechanisms of liver repair after liver IRI are not well understood. Recent technological advances have revealed the heterogeneity of each liver cell component in the steady state and diseased livers. In this review, we describe the progress in the biology of liver non-parenchymal cells obtained from novel technological advances. We address the functional role of each cell component in response to liver IRI and the interactions between diverse immune repertoires and non-hematopoietic cell populations during the course of liver repair after liver IRI. We also discuss how these findings can help in the design of novel therapeutic approaches. Growing insights into the cellular interactions during liver IRI would enhance the pathology of liver IRI understanding comprehensively and further develop the strategies for improvement of liver repair.\n",

      "Increasing evidence suggests that PCSK9 inhibition protects cardiomyocytes against ischemia-reperfusion injury after myocardial infarction. However, it is not clear whether PCSK9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) affects cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) activation after MI. In this study we used SBC-115076, an antagonist of PCSK9, to investigate the role of PCSK9i in the conversion of CFs to cardiac myofibroblasts (CMFs) after MI and provided a basic for its clinical application in cardiac fibrosis after MI. In vivo study, PCSK9i was injected into mice 4 days after MI. Cardiac function and degree of fibrosis were evaluated by echocardiographic and tissue staining after treatment. Western blot showed that PCSK9i treatment decreases expression of α-SMA, collagen and increases expression of Notch1 in border infarct area. Vitro studies showed that PCSK9i decreased the degree of fibrosis, migration, and collagen fiber deposition in CFs. Confocal microscopy imaging also showed that hypoxia contributes to the formation of α-SMA stress filaments, and PCSK9i alleviated this state. Moreover, overexpression of Notch1 further suppress the activation of CFs under hypoxia. These results revealed that SBC-115076 ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction through inhibition of the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts via Notch1/Hes1 signaling.\n",

      "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived exosomes are demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in stroke. We aimed to explore the role and mechanism of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) KLF3 antisense RNA 1 (KLF3-AS1) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes (BMSCs-Exos) in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of BMSCs. A mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo and a BV-2 cell model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/RX) in vitro were established. Cell viability and apoptosis were detected using MTT assay, TUNEL staining and flow cytometry, respectively. Related proteins were determined with western blot and immunohistochemistry, while related RNAs were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Neurological deficit and cerebral infarct volume were evaluated by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and TTC staining, respectively. Our observations indicate that exosomes derived from BMSCs-preconditioned medium exerted neuroprotective effects, as indicated by the increased cell viability and the suppressed apoptosis in OGD/RX-suffered BV-2 cells. KLF3-AS1 expression was upregulated in BMSCs-Exos. Furthermore, KLF3-AS1 knockdown antagonized the protective effects of BMSCs-Exos. Mechanistically, BMSCs-Exos carrying KLF3-AS1 inhibited apoptosis via enhancing autophagy. KLF3-AS1 was found to recruit ETS variant transcription factor 4 (ETV4), which upregulated Sirt1 expression. Knockdown of KLF3-AS1 neutralized the protective effects of BMSCs-Exos on MCAO-induced brain injury, which was then reversed by the treatment with Sirt1 inhibitor EX527. We concluded that KLF3-AS1 derived from BMSCs-Exos promoted autophagy to alleviate I/R injury via ETV4/Sirt1 axis.\n",

      "The Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil exerts neuroprotective effects. We previously showed that fasudil can regulate M1/M2 microglia polarization and inhibit neuroinflammation. Here, the therapeutic effect of fasudil on cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R) injury was investigated using the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in Sprague‑Dawley rats. The effect of fasudil on the phenotype of microglia and neurotrophic factors in the I/R brain and its potential molecular mechanism was also explored. It was found that fasudil ameliorated neurological deficits, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammatory response in rats with cerebral I/R injury. Fasudil also promoted the polarization of microglia into the M2 phenotype, in turn promoting the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, fasudil significantly inhibited the expression of TLR4 and NF‑κB. These findings suggest that fasudil could inhibit the neuroinflammatory response and reduce brain injury after I/R injury by regulating the shift of microglia from an inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti‑inflammatory M2 phenotype, which may be related to the regulation of the TLR4/ NF‑κB signal pathway.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which describes the cell damage and death that occurs after blood and oxygen are restored to ischemic or hypoxic tissue, is a significant factor within the mortality rates of heart disease and stroke patients. At the cellular level, the return of oxygen triggers an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) overload, which both contribute to cell death. Despite the widespread occurrence of IRI in different pathological conditions, there are currently no clinically approved therapeutic agents for its management. In this Perspective, we will briefly discuss the current therapeutic options for IRI and then describe in great detail the potential role and arising applications of metal-containing coordination and organometallic complexes for treating this condition. This Perspective categorizes these metal compounds based on their mechanisms of action, which include their use as delivery agents for gasotransmitters, inhibitors of mCa2+ uptake, and catalysts for the decomposition of ROS. Lastly, the challenges and opportunities for inorganic chemistry approaches to manage IRI are discussed.\n",

      "Ischemic stroke is a refractory disease that endangers human health and safety owing to cerebral ischemia. Brain ischemia induces a series of inflammatory reactions. Neutrophils migrate from the circulatory system to the site of cerebral ischemia and accumulate in large numbers at the site of inflammation across the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, hitchhiking on neutrophils to deliver drugs to ischemic brain sites could be an optimal strategy. Since the surface of neutrophils has a formyl peptide receptor (FPR), this work modifies a nanoplatform surface by the peptide cinnamyl-F-(D)L-F-(D)L-F (CFLFLF), which can specifically bind to the FPR receptor. After intravenous injection, the fabricated nanoparticles effectively adhered to the surface of neutrophils in peripheral blood mediated by FPR, thereby hitchhiking with neutrophils to achieve higher accumulation at the inflammatory site of cerebral ischemia. In addition, the nanoparticle shell is composed of a polymer with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive bond breaking and is encased in ligustrazine, a natural product with neuroprotective properties. In conclusion, the strategy of hitching the delivered drugs to neutrophils in this study could improve drug enrichment in the brain, thereby providing a general delivery platform for ischemic stroke or other inflammation-related diseases.\n",

      "Kidney ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a common cause of acute kidney injury (AKI), is associated with the migration of inflammatory cells into the kidney. Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), a member of the Rho family of small GTPase, plays an important role in inflammatory cell migration by cytoskeleton rearrangement. Here, we investigated the role of Rac1 on kidney I/R injury and macrophage migration. Male mice were subjected to either 25 min of bilateral ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R) or a sham operation. Some mice were administrated with either NSC23766, an inhibitor of Rac1, or 0.9% NaCl (vehicle). Kidney damage and Rac1 activity and expression were measured. The migration and lamellipodia formation of RAW264.7 cells, mouse monocyte/macrophage, induced by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, a chemokine) were determined using transwell migration assay and phalloidin staining, respectively. In sham-operated kidneys, Rac1 was expressed in tubular cells and interstitial cells. In I/R-injured kidneys, Rac1 expression was decreased in tubule cells in correlation with the damage of tubular cells, whereas Rac1 expression increased in the interstitium in correlation with an increased population of F4/80 cells, monocytes/macrophages. I/R increased Rac1 activity without changing total Rac1 expression in the whole kidney lysates. NSC23766 administration blocked Rac1 activation and protected the kidney against I/R-induced kidney damage and interstitial F4/80 cell increase. NSC23766 suppressed monocyte MCP-1-induced lamellipodia and filopodia formation and migration of RAW 264.7 cells. These results indicate Rac1 inhibition protects the kidney against I/R via inhibition of monocytes/macrophages migration into the kidney.\n",

      "Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides three-dimensional structural and semiquantitative imaging of microvasculature in vivo. We developed an OCTA imaging protocol for a murine kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) model to investigate the correlation between renal microvascular changes and ischemic damage. Mice were divided into mild and moderate IRI groups according to the duration of ischemia (10 and 35 mins, respectively). Each animal was imaged at baseline; during ischemia; and at 1, 15, 30, 45, and 60 mins after ischemia. Amplitude decorrelation OCTA images were constructed with 1.5-, 3.0-, and 5.8-ms interscan times, to calculate the semiquantitative flow index in the superficial (50-70 μm) and the deep (220-340 μm) capillaries of the renal cortex. The mild IRI group showed no significant flow index change in both the superfial and the deep layers. The moderate IRI group showed a significantly decreased flow index from 15 and 45 mins in the superficial and deep layers, respectively. Seven weeks after IRI induction, the moderate IRI group showed lower kidney function and higher collagen deposition than the mild IRI group. OCTA imaging of the murine IRI model revealed changes in superficial blood flow after ischemic injury. A more pronounced decrease in superficial blood flow than in deep blood flow was associated with sustained dysfunction after IRI. Further investigation on post-IRI renal microvascular response using OCTA may improve our understanding of the relationship between the degree of ischemic insult and kidney function.\n",

Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) play a key role in the brain functioning by regulating the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons, neuronal plasticity, food intake, peripheral metabolism, and endocrine functions. Insulin and IGF-1 produce multiple effects in the brain, including neuroprotective action in cerebral ischemia and stroke. Experiments in animals and cell cultures have shown that under hypoxic conditions, insulin and IGF-1 improve energy metabolism in neurons and glial cells, promote blood microcirculation in the brain, restore nerve cell functions and neurotransmission, and produce the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects on brain cells. The intranasal route of insulin and IGF-1 administration is of particular interest in the clinical practice, since it allows controlled delivery of these hormones directly to the brain, bypassing the blood-brain barrier. Intranasally administered insulin alleviated cognitive impairments in elderly people with neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders; intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 promoted survival of animals with ischemic stroke. The review discusses the published data and results of our own studies on the mechanisms of neuroprotective action of intranasally administered insulin and IGF-1 in cerebral ischemia, as well as the prospects of using these hormones for normalization of CNS functions and reduction of neurodegenerative changes in this pathology.\n",

      "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays an important role in cardiac protection by regulating various redox signalings associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) induced injury. The goal of the present investigations is the synthesis of a newly designed H2S-releasing ibuprofen derivative, BM-88, and its pharmacological characterization regarding the cardioprotective effects in isolated rat hearts. Cytotoxicity of BM-88 was also estimated in H9c2 cells. H2S-release was measured by an H2S sensor from the coronary perfusate. Increasing concentrations of BM-88 (1.0 to 20.0 µM) were tested in vitro studies. Preadministration of 10 µM BM-88 significantly reduced the incidence of reperfusion-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) from its drug-free control value of 92% to 12%. However, no clear dose dependent reduction in the incidence of reperfusion-induced VF was observed while different concentrations of BM-88 were used. It was also found that 10 µM BM-88 provided a substantial protection and significantly reduced the infarct size in the ischemic/reperfused myocardium. However, this cardiac protection was not reflected in any significant changes in coronary flow and heart rates. The results support the fact that H2S release plays an important role mitigating reperfusion-induced cardiac damage.\n",

      "Enolase-phosphatase 1 (ENOPH1) is a newly identified enzyme associated with stress responses and cell proliferation. Our previous study found that ENOPH1 mediates cerebral microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis under cerebral ischemia conditions. In this study, we systematically provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of ENOPH1 in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfuction induced by early ischemia. ENOPH1 knockout mice (ENOPH1 KO) and wild type (WT) mice were exposed to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 min followed by 3 h of reperfusion in vivo, and brain microvascular endothelial cell lines (bEnd.3 cells) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. BEnd.3 cells were transfected with ENOPH1 shRNA to knockdown ENOPH1 expression. Brain ischemic damage and nerve function was assessed with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and neurological scores. BBB permeability and tight junction (TJ) protein and adherens junction (AJ) proteins expression were analyzed by FITC-dextran staining, western blotting and coimmunofluorescence. The MMP-2/9 activity was analyzed by gelatin zymography. Differential protein expression was assessed by quantitative proteomics. The interaction between ADI1 and MT1-MMP was measured by coimmunoprecipitation assay and coimmunofluorescence. Knockout of ENOPH1 ameliorated cerebral ischemic injury, decreased BBB permeability, inhibited the activity of MMP-2/9, upregulated the expression of TJ/AJ proteins and reversed extracellular matrix destruction after ischemia in vivo. Mechanistic studies have shown that ENOPH1 silencing enhanced the interaction between ADI1 and MT1-MMP by promoting the nuclear translocation of ADI1 to inhibit MT1-MMP in bEnd.3 cells after OGD and decreasing the expression of Tnc and Fn1 to inhibit ECM degradation. Our results reveal that ENOPH1 increases the activity of MMP-2/9, then promotes TJ protein and extracellular matrix degradation, and eventually destroys the stability of the BBB. Therefore, ENOPH1 is a new therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.\n",

      "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the major causes of acute kidney injury (AKI), and experimental work has revealed detailed insight into the inflammatory response in the kidney. T cells and NFκB pathway play an important role in IRI. Therefore, we examined the regulatory role and mechanisms of IkappaB kinase 1 (IKK1) in CD4+T lymphocytes in an experimental model of IRI. IRI was induced in CD4cre and CD4IKK1Δ mice. Compared to control mice, conditional deficiency of IKK1 in CD4+T lymphocyte significantly decreased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, and renal tubular injury score. Mechanistically, lack in IKK1 in CD4+T lymphocytes reduced the ability of CD4 lymphocytes to differentiate into Th1/Th17 cells. Similar to IKK1 gene ablation, pharmacological inhibition of IKK also protected mice from IRI. Together, lymphocyte IKK1 plays a pivotal role in IRI by promoting T cells differentiation into Th1/Th17 and targeting lymphocyte IKK1 may be a novel therapeutic strategy for IRI.\n",

      "Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease that is now the most important cause of death due to brain problems in our country. CircRNAs are RNA circles that have been extensively involved in the disease. We aimed to investigate the mechanism of circ_0129657 in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this study, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot assays were used to assess the expression of circ_0129657, miR-194-5p, and glia maturation factor beta (GMFB). Cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. 5-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyuridine (EdU) assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. Dual-luciferase reporter, RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were used to assess the relationship between miR-194-5p and circ_0129657 or GMFB. Mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was applied to mimic the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our data showed that the levels of circ_0129657 and GMFB were significantly increased and the expression of miR-194-5p was significantly decreased in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). Silencing circ_0129657 expression in OGD-induced HBMECs could promote cell viability and cell proliferation. Moreover, circ_0129657 depletion also could inhibit apoptosis and inflammatory factor secretion. Circ_0129657 functioned as a sponge for miR-194-5p and could regulate GMFB expression via miR-194-5p competition. Furthermore, miR-194-5p downregulation or GMFB restoration could partially reverse the effects of circ_0129657 silencing on cell biological properties in OGD-induced HBMECs. Meanwhile, circ_0129657 knockdown decreased cerebral infarction volume and neurological impairment in MCAO mouse models. In conclusion, our findings suggest that circ_0129657 can inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis and inflammatory factor secretion in HBMECs after oxygen-glucose deprivation via miR-194-5p/GMFB axis, providing evidence that circ_0129657 has the potential as a useful biological molecular marker in the diagnosis of stroke.\n",

      "Local ischemia in the cerebra leads to vascular injury and necrosis. Ferroptosis is involved in the pathophysiological process of many diseases and widely exists when ischemia-reperfusion injury occurs in many organs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Butylphthalide (NBP) on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats model-caused neuron injury. Sprague Dawley Rats were randomly allocated to receive sham and MCAO operation. NBP low-dose (40 mg/kg b.w), and high-dose (80 mg/kg b.w) were administrated in MACO rats. Results showed NBP improves infarct volume, attenuates neuronal apoptosis in the brain tissue of MCAO rats. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), IL-6, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels decreased after NBP administration, while the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the ratio of GSH/GSSG in MACO rats increased. MACO caused non-heme iron accumulation in the brain tissue and Perl's staining confirmed NBP attenuates ferroptosis in MACO rats. The protein expressions of SCL7A11 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) decreased following MCAO, and NBP treatment subsequently increased the expression of SCL7A11 and GPX4. In vitro analysis in cortical neuron cells indicated that the GPX4 inhibitor reverses the inhibition of ferroptosis by NBP, which suggested that the SCL7A11/GPX4 pathway majorly contributed to the NBP ferroptosis protection effect.\n",

This renoprotective effect is suggested to be mediated through activation of Nrf2 and the prevention of the NF-κB activation-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, which may strengthen the potential role of ZnO-NPs or MIL in renal I/RI protection during surgical procedures.\n",

      "Pyroptosis is a new type of programmed cell death, which induces a strong pro-inflammatory reaction. However, the mechanism of pyroptosis after brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and the interaction between different neural cell types are still unclear. This study comprehensively explored the mechanisms and interactions of microglial and neuronal pyroptosisin the simulated I/R environment in vitro. The BV2 (as microglial) and HT22(as neuronal) cells were treated by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Both BV2 and HT22 cells underwent pyroptosis after OGD/R, and the pyroptosis occurred at earlier time point in HT22than that of BV2. Caspase-11 and Gasdermin E expression in BV2 and HT22 cells did not change significantly after OGD/R. Inhibition of caspase-1 or GSDMD activity, or down-regulation of GSDMD expression, alleviated pyroptosis in both BV2 and HT22 cells after OGD/R. Transwell studies further showed that OGD/R-treated HT22 or BV2 cells aggravated pyroptosis of adjacent non-OGD/R-treated cells, which could be relieved by inhibition of caspase-1 or GSDMD. These results suggested that OGD/R induces pyroptosis of microglia and neuronal cells and aggravates cell injury via activation of caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that caspase-1 and GSDMD may be therapeutic targets after cerebral I/R.\n",

      "Extremely anoxia-tolerant animals, such as freshwater turtles, survive anoxia and reoxygenation without sustaining tissue damage to their hearts. In contrast, for mammals, the ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury that leads to tissue damage during a heart attack is initiated by a burst of superoxide (O2·-) production from the mitochondrial respiratory chain upon reperfusion of ischemic tissue. Whether turtles avoid oxidative tissue damage because of an absence of mitochondrial superoxide production upon reoxygenation, or because the turtle heart is particularly protected against this damage, is unclear. Here, we investigated whether there was an increase in mitochondrial O2·- production upon the reoxygenation of anoxic red-eared slider turtle hearts in vivo and in vitro. This was done by measuring the production of H2O2, the dismutation product of O2·-, using the mitochondria-targeted mass-spectrometric probe in vivo MitoB, while in parallel assessing changes in the metabolites driving mitochondrial O2·- production, succinate, ATP and ADP levels during anoxia, and H2O2 consumption and production rates of isolated heart mitochondria. We found that there was no excess production of in vivo H2O2 during 1 h of reoxygenation in turtles after 3 h anoxia at room temperature, suggesting that turtle hearts most likely do not suffer oxidative injury after anoxia because their mitochondria produce no excess O2·- upon reoxygenation. Instead, our data support the conclusion that both the low levels of succinate accumulation and the maintenance of ADP levels in the anoxic turtle heart are key factors in preventing the surge of O2·- production upon reoxygenation.\n",

      "N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) plays key roles in the regulation of biological functions and cellular mechanisms for ischaemia reperfusion (IR) injury in different organs. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of m6A-modified mRNAs in hepatic IR injury. In mouse models, liver samples were subjected to methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In total, 16917 m6A peaks associated with 4098 genes were detected in the sham group, whereas 21,557 m6A peaks associated with 5322 genes were detected in the IR group. There were 909 differentially expressed m6A peaks, 863 differentially methylated transcripts and 516 differentially m6A modification genes determined in both groups. The distribution of m6A peaks was especially enriched in the coding sequence and 3'UTR. Furthermore, we identified a relationship between differentially m6A methylated genes (fold change≥1.5/≤ 0.667, p value≤0.05) and differentially expressed genes (fold change≥1.5 and p value≤0.05) to obtain three overlapping predicted target genes (Fnip2, Phldb2, and Pcf11). Our study revealed a transcriptome-wide map of m6A mRNAs in hepatic IR injury and might provide a theoretical basis for future research in terms of molecular mechanisms.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia triggers a powerful inflammatory reaction involving both peripheral leukocytes and brain resident cells. Recent evidence indicates that their differentiation into a variety of functional phenotypes contributes to both tissue injury and repair. However, the temporal dynamics and diversity of post-stroke immune cell subsets remain poorly understood. To address these limitations, we performed a longitudinal single-cell transcriptomic study of both brain and mouse blood to obtain a composite picture of brain-infiltrating leukocytes, circulating leukocytes, microglia and endothelium diversity over the ischemic/reperfusion time. Brain cells and blood leukocytes isolated from mice 2 or 14 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery were purified by FACS sorting and processed for droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics. The analysis revealed a strong divergence of post-ischemic microglia, macrophages, and neutrophils over time, while such diversity was less evident in dendritic cells, B, T and NK cells. Conversely, brain endothelial cells and brain associated-macrophages showed altered transcriptomic signatures at 2 days post-stroke, but low divergence from sham at day 14. Pseudotime trajectory inference predicted the in-situ longitudinal progression of monocyte-derived macrophages from their blood precursors into day 2 and day 14 phenotypes, while microglia phenotypes at these two time points were not connected. In contrast to monocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils were predicted to be continuously de-novo recruited from the blood. Brain single-cell transcriptomics from both female and male aged mice did not show major changes in respect to young mice, but aged and young brains differed in their immune cell composition. Furthermore, blood leukocyte analysis also revealed altered transcriptomes after stroke. However, brain-infiltrating leukocytes displayed higher transcriptomic divergence than their circulating counterparts, indicating that phenotypic diversification into cellular subsets occurs within the brain in the early and the recovery phase of ischemic stroke. In addition, this resource report contains a searchable database https://anratherlab.shinyapps.io/strokevis/ to allow user-friendly access to our data. The StrokeVis tool constitutes a comprehensive gene expression atlas that can be interrogated at the gene and cell type level to explore the transcriptional changes of endothelial and immune cell subsets from mouse brain and blood after stroke.\n",

Reperfusion or revascularization techniques are essential in reestablishing blood flow to ischemic tissues. This study aims to demonstrate the association between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a revascularization technique, and the electrocardiography (ECG) parameter, QT dispersion (QTd). We conducted a systematic review of the association between PCI and QTd through a literature search in three electronic databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar, for empirical studies published in English. Review Manager (RevMan) 5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England) was used for statistical analysis. Of 3,626 studies, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria, enrolling a total of 1,239 patients. After a successful PCI procedure, QTd and corrected QT (QTc) tremendously reduced at various time intervals with statistical significance in most of the studies. There was a clear association between ECG parameters QTd, QTc, and corrected QT dispersion (QTcd), and PCI, in that there is a considerable reduction in these ECG parameters after PCI treatment.\n",

      "Menthofuran is a monoterpene present in various essential oils derived from species from Mentha genus, and in Brazil, those species are widely used in treating gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Considering the wide pharmacological potential of monoterpenes, including their antioxidant activity, this study aimed to evaluate menthofuran-gastroprotective activity, as well as the involvement of antioxidant mechanisms in this effect. The acute toxicity was evaluated according to the fixed dose method. The antiulcerogenic activity was investigated by using experimental models of gastric ulcers induced by ethanol, indomethacin, and ischemia/reperfusion in rats. The antisecretory gastric activity, the catalase activity, and the gastric wall mucus were determined in pylorus ligated rats. Gastric wall nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) group content, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evaluated in ethanol-induced the gastric ulcer model. Menthofuran (2 g/kg) presented low acute toxicity and showed gastroprotective activity against ethanol-, indomethacin-, and ischemia/reperfusion-induced ulcers. Moreover, menthofuran presented antisecretory activity, reduced the total acidity, and increased pH of gastric secretion. On the other hand, a decrease in mucus content of gastric wall without alteration of gastric juice volume and catalase activity was observed. Interestingly, menthofuran increased NPSH levels and reduced MDA levels and MPO activity. Gastroprotective effects of menthofuran appear to be mediated, at least in part, by the NOS pathway, endogenous prostaglandins, reduced gastric juice acidity, increased concentration of the NPSH groups, and reduced lipidic peroxidation. These findings support the menthofuran as an effective gastroprotective agent, as well as the marked participation of antioxidant mechanisms in this response.\n",

      "Aims: The invasive intramyocardial injection of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) allows for limited repeat injections and shows poor therapeutic efficacy against ischemic heart failure. Intravenous injection is an alternative method because this route allows for repeated, noninvasive, and easy delivery. However, the lack of targeting of MSCs hinders the ability of these cells to accumulate in the ischemic area after intravenous injections. We investigated whether and how the overexpression of colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor beta subunit (CSF2RB) may regulate the cardiac homing of MSCs and their cardioprotective effects against ischemic heart failure. Methods and Results: Adult mice were subjected to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) or sham operations. We observed significantly higher CSF2 protein expression and secretion by the ischemic heart from 1 day to 2 weeks after MI/R. Mouse adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs) were infected with adenovirus harboring CSF2RB or control adenovirus. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-labeled ADSCs were intravenously injected into MI/R mice every three days for a total of 7 times. Compared with ADSCs infected with control adenovirus, intravenously delivered ADSCs overexpressing CSF2RB exhibited markedly increased cardiac homing. Histological analysis revealed that CSF2RB overexpression significantly enhanced the ADSC-mediated proangiogenic, antiapoptotic, and antifibrotic effects. More importantly, ADSCs overexpressing CSF2RB significantly increased the left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac contractility/relaxation in MI/R mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that CSF2RB overexpression increases the migratory capacity and reduces the hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis of ADSCs. We identified STAT5 phosphorylation as the key mechanism underlying the effects of CSF2RB on promoting ADSC migration and inhibiting ADSC apoptosis. RNA sequencing followed by cause-effect analysis revealed that CSF2RB overexpression increases the expression of the ubiquitin ligase RNF4. Coimmunoprecipitation and coimmunostaining experiments showed that RNF4 binds to phosphorylated STAT5. RNF4 knockdown reduced STAT5 phosphorylation as well as the antiapoptotic and promigratory actions of ADSCs overexpressing CSF2RB. Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that CSF2RB overexpression optimizes the efficacy of intravenously delivered MSCs in the treatment of ischemic heart injury by increasing the response of the MSCs to a CSF2 gradient and CSF2RB-dependent STAT5/RNF4 activation.\n",

      "Thrombotic microangiopathy is not a rare complication of kidney transplantation and is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury with extensive thrombosis of the arterioles and capillaries. Various factors can cause thrombotic microangiopathy after kidney transplantation, including surgery, warm and cold ischemia-reperfusion injury, exposure to immunosuppressants, infection, and rejection. Many recent studies on atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have described genetic abnormalities related to excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. The affected patients' genetic backgrounds revealed significant genetic heterogeneity in several genes involved in complement regulation, including the complement factor H, complement factor H-related proteins, complement factor I, complement factor B, complement component 3, and CD46 genes in the alternative complement pathway. Although clinical studies have provided a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases, the diverse triggers present in the transplant environment can lead to thrombotic microangiopathy, along with various genetic predispositions, and it is difficult to identify the genetic background in various clinical conditions. Given the poor prognosis of posttransplant thrombotic microangiopathy, further research is necessary to improve the diagnosis and treatment protocols based on risk factors or genetic predisposition, and to develop new therapeutic agents.\n",

      "Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Delayed tPA administration is associated with increased risks of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and hemorrhagic transformation. Studies have shown that interferon beta (IFNβ) or type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) signaling confers protection against ischemic stroke in preclinical models. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that IFNβ can be co-administered with tPA to alleviate delayed tPA-induced adverse effects in ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the time limit of IFNβ treatment on the extension of tPA therapeutic window and assessed the effect of IFNβ on modulating microglia (MG) phenotypes in ischemic stroke with delayed tPA treatment. Mice were subjected to 40 minutes transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by delayed tPA treatment in the presence or absence of IFNβ at 3h, 4.5h or 6h post-reperfusion. In addition, mice with MG-specific IFNAR1 knockdown were generated to validate the effects of IFNβ on modulating MG phenotypes, ameliorating brain injury, and lessening BBB disruption in delayed tPA-treated MCAO mice. Our results showed that IFNβ extended tPA therapeutic window to 4.5h post-reperfusion in MCAO mice, and that was accompanied with attenuated brain injury and lessened BBB disruption. Mechanistically, our findings revealed that IFNβ modulated MG polarization, leading to the suppression of inflammatory MG and the promotion of anti-inflammatory MG, in delayed tPA-treated MCAO mice. Notably, these effects were abolished in MG-specific IFNAR1 knockdown MCAO mice. Furthermore, the protective effect of IFNβ on the amelioration of delayed tPA-exacerbated ischemic brain injury was also abolished in these mice. Finally, we identified that IFNβ-mediated modulation of MG phenotypes played a role in maintaining BBB integrity, because the knockdown of IFNAR1 in MG partly reversed the protective effect of IFNβ on lessening BBB disruption in delayed tPA-treated MCAO mice. In summary, our study reveals a novel function of IFNβ in modulating MG phenotypes, and that may subsequently confer protection against delayed tPA-exacerbated brain injury in ischemic stroke.\n",

Previous transcriptomic studies of ischemic stroke have typically focused on the 24 hours after CIRI, obscuring the dynamics of cellular subclusters throughout the disease process.

      "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by high incidence and poor prognosis. The regulatory role of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) in HIRI has been reported, but if miR-146a could affect the progression of HIRI-induced ALI has not been reported. The mice HIRI model was established by ligating left hepatic portal vein and hepatic artery for 60 minutes and then treating with reperfusion for 4 hours. Hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) was performed to establish cell model. The binding site between miR-146a and Peroxidase 1 (PRDX1) was predicted and validated. The levels of inflammation factors and redox markers were detected with commercial kits. Significant lower expression of miR-146a and higher expression of PRDX1 in HIRI animal model were observed. miR-146a inhibited the liver injury after HIRI induction through targeting PRDX1. miR-146a inhibited the lung injury caused by HIRI via regulating PRDX1. The inhibition of cell apoptosis and inflammation factors by miR-146a were reversed by pcDNA-PRDX1. This research demonstrated that miR-146a improved ALI caused by HIRI by inhibiting apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative condition through targeting PRDX1. This study might provide a novel thought for the prevention and treatment of ALI caused by HIRI by regulating miR-146a/PRDX1 axis.\n",

      "Backgrounds: The circadian clock protein Rev-erbα is a crucial regulator of circadian rhythms that affects multiple molecular, cellular, and physiology pathways that control susceptibility, injury, and recovery in the neurological disorders. Emerging evidence suggest that Rev-erbα plays a key role in the inflammation and oxidative stress, two pivotal mechanisms in the pathogenesis, progression, and recovery process of ischemic stroke. However, it remains inconclusive whether Rev-erbα activation is protective against ischemic brain damage. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, a master regulator of inflammatory and oxidative responses. Our study aimed to determine whether pharmacological activation of Rev-erbα by SR9009 protects against acute ischemic brain damage partly via Nrf2 pathway. Methods: Adult mice were pretreated with SR9009 or Nrf2 inhibitor all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) for 3 days prior to Sham or middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. After ischemia for 1 h and reperfusion for 24 h, the neurological function and cerebral infarction volume were determined, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity in serum were detected by kit. The mRNA and/or protein level of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Period (Per)1, Brain and muscle arnt-like1 (Bmal1), Circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (Clock), Rev-erbα, Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in cerebral cortex were detected by q-PCR and Western blot. Results: We confirmed that SR9009 activated Rev-erbα gene in the cerebral cortex under basal condition. At 24 h after reperfusion, SR9009 ameliorated acute neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume. Meanwhile, the inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and MDA content levels were significant decreased, SOD and GSH-PX activity were obviously increased, which were markedly blunted (or abolished) by ATRA. SR9009 enhanced the induction of Nrf2 and its downstream target genes HO-1 and NQO1 after ischemic insult. In addition, we found that SR9009 restored Rev-erbα, Bmal1, Clock, Per1 genes expression in the cerebral cortex under ischemic condition. Conclusion: Taken together, Rev-erbα activation by SR9009 protects against ischemic stroke damage, at least, partly through Nrf2 pathway.\n",

      "Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/R) leads to the inevitable clinical consequences of myocardial infarction and subsequent heart failure. Trimetazidine (TMZ), an anti-ischemic agent, exerts protective potential in MI/R but had limited efficacy for some patients. Here we sought to investigate the single and combined application of gentiopicroside (GPS) and TMZ in MI/R. Notably, GPS had little cytotoxicity to cardiomyocytes. GPS attenuated hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death, reactive oxygen species production, lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde releases, and antioxidant stress enzyme superoxide dismutase activity, indicating the protective efficacy of GPS against H/R-induced oxidative injury. Importantly, GPS enhanced the protective efficacy of TMZ against H/R-mediated cardiomyocyte injury. Additionally, GPS mitigated the transcription and releases of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes, which were enhanced after co-treatment with TMZ. Mechanistically, GPS activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling to inhibit H/R-induced NOD-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which was further enhanced after costimulation with TMZ. Importantly, blocking the AMPK signaling reversed the protective roles of GPS and its combination with TMZ in H/R-induced oxidative insult and inflammation. In vivo, both GPS and TMZ alleviated the abnormal cardiac structure, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and cardiac dysfunction in MI/R rats, which were further enhanced after administration with GPS and TMZ together. Furthermore, GPS intensified TMZ-mediated inhibition of oxidative injury, inflammation, and the AMPK/NLRP3 signaling in MI/R rats. Collectively, GPS enhances the protective efficacy of TMZ against MI/R injury through AMPK activation-mediated inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, implying a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of MI/R.\n",

Ferritinophagy is selective autophagy mediated by nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), which regulates iron homeostasis in the body. Upon iron depletion or starvation, ferritinophagy is activated, releasing large amounts of Fe2+ and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to ferroptosis. This plays a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of many diseases, such as metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, tumors, cardiomyopathy, and ischemia-reperfusion ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      "Physiologic Ca2+ entry via the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU) participates in energetic adaption to workload but may also contribute to cell death during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The MCU has been identified as the primary mode of Ca2+ import into mitochondria. Several groups have tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ import via MCU is detrimental during I/R injury using genetically-engineered mouse models, yet the results from these studies are inconclusive. Furthermore, mitochondria exhibit unstable or oscillatory membrane potentials (ΔΨm) when subjected to stress, such as during I/R, but it is unclear if the primary trigger is an excess influx of mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+), reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, or other factors. Here, we critically examine whether MCU-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during I/R is involved in ΔΨm instability, or sustained mitochondrial depolarization, during reperfusion by acutely knocking out MCU in neonatal mouse ventricular myocyte (NMVM) monolayers subjected to simulated I/R. Unexpectedly, we find that MCU knockout does not significantly alter mCa2+ import during I/R, nor does it affect ΔΨm recovery during reperfusion. In contrast, blocking the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger (mNCE) suppressed the mCa2+ increase during Ischemia but did not affect ΔΨm recovery or the frequency of ΔΨm oscillations during reperfusion, indicating that mitochondrial ΔΨm instability on reperfusion is not triggered by mCa2+. Interestingly, inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport or supplementation with antioxidants stabilized I/R-induced ΔΨm oscillations. The findings are consistent with mCa2+ overload being mediated by reverse-mode mNCE activity and supporting ROS-induced ROS release as the primary trigger of ΔΨm instability during reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Irisin is a muscle-derived hormone that promotes the survival of motor neurons and enhances muscle size following injury. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effects and mechanism(s) of action of irisin in response to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Right-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) models were generated in C57BL/6 J mice. Mouse neuronal cell lines (NSC-34) were used to confirm the molecular mechanisms of the protection afforded by irisin in response to CIRI. We found that irisin (250 μg/kg) improved cerebral function and reduced the cerebral infarct volume following CIRI. Irisin also protected neuronal cells against ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induced apoptosis, assessed via TUNEL, and cleaved Caspase-3 staining. Western blotting of neuronal tissue from irisin treated I/R mice showed lower expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-9 (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01) and increased levels of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 (P < 0.01 & P < 0.001 vs. I/R). Irisin also reduced the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) characterized through malondialdehyde (MDA) assays. Irisin was found to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through the suppression of mitochondrial fission-linked dynamin-related protein 1 in CIRI mice (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 v. I/R cohort). Moreover, mitochondrial fusion-related protein (Mfn2) and Opa1 expression were rescued following irisin treatment (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01 v. I/R cohort). Cell-based assays showed that irisin activates PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the neurons of CIRI mice. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of irisin on NSC-34 cell-survival, mitochondrial function, and ROS generation were reversed by VS-5584, a highly specific PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor. Collectively, these data highlight the ability of irisin to alleviate CIRI in vivo and in vitro. The mechanisms of action of irisin include the attenuation of apoptosis through the prevention of mitochondrial fission and increased mitochondrial fusion and the alleviation of oxidative stress through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. We therefore identify irisin as a much-needed therapeutic for CIRI.\n",

Therefore, we performed this study to clarify the role of GATA6 in neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis in cerebral I/R injury. The cerebral I/R injury-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as well as the downstream factors of GATA6 were predicted bioinformatically. Moreover, the relations between GATA6 and miR-193b and that between miR-193b and ATG7 were evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Besides, neurons were treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), followed by overexpression of GATA6, miR-193b, and ATG7 alone or in combination to assess neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis. At last, in vivo experiments were performed to explore the impacts of GATA6/miR-193b/ATG7 on neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-stimulated cerebral I/R injury. It was found that GATA6 and miR-193b were poorly expressed in cerebral I/R injury. GATA6 transcriptionally activated miR-193b to downregulate ATG7. Additionally, GATA6-mediated miR-193b activation suppressed neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis in OGD-treated neurons by inhibiting ATG7. Furthermore, GATA6/miR-193b relieved cerebral I/R injury by restraining neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis via downregulation of ATG7 in vivo. In summary, GATA6 might prevent neuronal autophagy and ferroptosis to alleviate cerebral I/R injury via the miR-193b/ATG7 axis.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is a common neurological disease. Homeobox A11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been demonstrated as an important regulator in diverse human cancers. However, its function and regulatory mechanism in ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) have received wide attraction because of its neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to explore the possible link between Dex and HOXA11-AS in protecting neuronal cells from by ischemia/reperfusion-induced apoptosis. We used oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) mouse model to test the link. We found that Dex significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced DNA fragmentation, cell viability and apoptosis, and rescued the decreased HOXA11-AS expression after ischemic damage in Neuro-2a cells. Gain-/loss-of-function studies revealed that HOXA11-AS promoted proliferation, inhibited apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells exposed to OGD/R. Knockdown of HOXA11-AS decreased the protective effect of Dex on OGD/R cells. HOXA11-AS was found to transcriptionally regulate microRNA-337-3p (miR-337-3p) expression as evidenced by luciferase reporter assay, while miR-337-3p expression was upregulated following ischemia in vitro and in vivo. Besides, knockdown of miR-337-3p protected OGD/R-induced apoptotic death of Neuro-2a cells. Furthermore, HOXA11-AS functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and competed with Y box protein 1 (Ybx1) mRNA for directly binding to miR-337-3p, which protected ischemic neuronal death. Dex treatment protected against ischemic damage and improved overall neurological functions in vivo.

      "SHPL-49 ((2R,3S,4S,5R,6R)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-6-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl) butoxy) tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol) is a novel glycoside derivative obtained from structural modification of salidroside, which is isolated from the medicinal plant Rhodiola rosea L. SHPL-49 was administered to rats with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) for 5 days, and it was found that SHPL-49 could alleviate the cerebral infarct volume and reduce the neurological deficit score. Moreover, the effective time window of SHPL-49 in the pMCAO model was from 0.5 to 8 h after embolization. In addition, the result of immunohistochemistry showed that SHPL-49 could increase the number of neurons in the brain tissue and reduce the occurrence of apoptosis. Morris water maze and Rota-rod experiments showed that SHPL-49 could improve neurological deficits, repair neurocognitive and motor dysfunction, and enhance learning and memory ability in the pMCAO model after 14 days of SHPL-49 treatment. Further in vitro experiments showed that SHPL-49 significantly reduced the calcium overload of PC-12 cells and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), decreased the production of malondialdehyde (MDA). Furthermore, SHPL-49 could reduce cell apoptosis by increasing protein expression ratio of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 to pro-apoptotic factor Bax in vitro. SHPL-49 also regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in ischemic brain tissue, and even inhibited the caspase cascade of pro-apoptotic proteins Cleaved-caspase 9 and Cleaved-caspase 3. Taken together, SHPL-49 exhibited neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury through multiple pathways, such as alleviating calcium overload, reducing oxidative stress damage, and inhibiting apoptosis.\n",

      "Neurological disorders with various etiologies impacting the nervous system are prevalent in clinical practice. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) molecules are functional RNA molecules exceeding 200 nucleotides in length that do not encode proteins, but participate in essential activities. Research indicates that lncRNAs may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, and may be potential targets for their treatment. Phytochemicals in traditional Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) have been found to exert neuroprotective effects by targeting lncRNAs and regulating gene expression and various signaling pathways. We aim to establish the development status and neuroprotective mechanism of phytochemicals that target lncRNAs through a thorough literature review. A total of 369 articles were retrieved through manual and electronic searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and CNKI databases from inception to September 2022. The search utilized combinations of natural products, lncRNAs, neurological disorders, and neuroprotective effects as keywords. The included studies, a total of 31 preclinical trials, were critically reviewed to present the current situation and the progress in phytochemical-targeted lncRNAs in neuroprotection. Phytochemicals have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies of various neurological disorders by regulating lncRNAs. These disorders include arteriosclerotic ischemia-reperfusion injury, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, glioma, peripheral nerve injury, post-stroke depression, and depression. Several phytochemicals exert neuroprotective roles through mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptosis, autophagy regulation, and antagonism of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Some phytochemicals targeted lncRNAs and served a neuroprotective role by regulating microRNA and mRNA expression. The emergence of lncRNAs as pathological regulators provides a novel direction for the study of phytochemicals in CHM. Elucidating the mechanism of phytochemicals regulating lncRNAs will help to identify new therapeutic targets and promote their application in precision medicine.\n",

      "Cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIR) is one of the clinical manifestations encountered during the management of stroke. High prevalence of intracranial arterial calcification is reported in stroke patients. However, the impact of vascular calcification (VC) in the outcome of CIR and the efficacy of mechanical preconditioning (IPC) and pharmacological conditioning with sodium thiosulphate (STS) in ameliorating IR remains unclear. Two experimental models namely carotid artery occlusion (n = 36) and brain slice models (n = 18) were used to evaluate the efficacy of STS in male Wistar rats. IR was inflicted in rat by occluding carotid artery for 30 min followed by 24-h reperfusion after STS (100 mg/kg) administration. Brain slice model was used to reconfirm the results to account blood brain barrier permeability. Further, brain slice tissue was utilised to evaluate the efficacy of STS in VC rat brain by measuring the histological alterations and biochemical parameters. Pre-treatment of STS prior to CIR in intact animal significantly reduced the IR-associated histopathological alterations in brain, declined oxidative stress and improved the mitochondrial function found to be similar to IPC. Brain slice model data also confirmed the neuroprotective effect of STS similar to IPC in IR challenged tissue slice. Higher tissue injury was noted in VC brain IR tissue than normal IR tissue. Therapeutic efficacy of STS was evident in VC rat brain tissues and normal tissues subjected to IR. On the other hand, IPC-mediated protection was noted only in IR normal and adenine-induced VC brain tissues not in high-fat diet (HFD) induced VC brain tissues. Based on the results, we concluded that similar to IPC, STS was effective in attenuating IR injury in CIR rat brain. Vascular calcification adversely affected the recovery protocol of brain tissues from ischemic insult. STS was found to be an effective agent in ameliorating the IR injury in both adenine and HFD induced vascular calcified rat brain, but IPC-mediated neuroprotection was absent in HFD-induced VC brain tissues.\n",

      "Cardiac contractile function requires high energy from mitochondria, and Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Via local Ca2+ transfer at close mitochondria-SR contacts, cardiac excitation feedforward regulates mitochondrial ATP production to match surges in demand (excitation-bioenergetics coupling). However, pathological stresses may cause mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, excessive reactive oxygen species production and permeability transition, risking homeostatic collapse and myocyte loss. Excitation-bioenergetics coupling involves mitochondria-SR tethers but the role of tethering in cardiac physiology/pathology is debated. Endogenous tether proteins are multifunctional; therefore, nonselective targets to scrutinize interorganelle linkage. Here, we assessed the physiological/pathological relevance of selective chronic enhancement of cardiac mitochondria-SR tethering.\n",

Remarkably, the linker decreased female vulnerability to acute massive β-adrenergic stress. It also reduced myocyte death and mitochondrial calcium-overload-associated myocardial impairment in ex vivo ischemia/reperfusion injury.\n",

      "Background: Ischemic stroke seriously threatens human health because of high rates of morbidity, mortality and disability. This study compared the effects of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and butylphthalide (NBP) on in vitro and in vivo ischemic stroke models. Methods: Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (t-MCAO/R) model was established in mice, and the cultured primary cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Cerebral infarct volume, neurobehavioral indices, antioxidant activity, ATP level and lactic acid content were determined. The neuroprotective effects of NAD+ or NBP were compared using sirtuin inhibitor niacinamide (NAM). Results: Intraperitoneal injection of NBP within 4 h or intravenous injection of NAD+ within 1 h after t-MCAO/R significantly reduced the volume of infarcts, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits. Administration of NAD+ and NBP immediately after t-MCAO/R in mice showed similar neuroprotection against acute and long-term ischemic injury. Both NAD+ and NBP significantly inhibited the accumulation of MDA and H2O2 and reduced oxidative stress. NAD+ was superior to NBP in inhibiting lipid oxidation and DNA damage. Furthermore, although both NAD+ and NBP improved the morphology of mitochondrial damage induced by ischemia/reperfusion, NAD+ more effectively reversed the decrease of ATP and increase of lactic acid after ischemia/reperfusion compared with NBP. NAD+ but not NBP treatment significantly upregulated SIRT3 in the brain, but the sirtuin inhibitor NAM could abolish the protective effect of NAD+ and NBP by inhibiting SIRT1 or SIRT3. Conclusions: These results confirmed the protective effects of NAD+ and NBP on cerebral ischemic injury. NBP and NAD+ showed similar antioxidant effects, while NAD+ had better ability in restoring energy metabolism, possibly through upregulating the activity of SIRT1 and SIRT3. The protection provided by NBP against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion may be achieved through SIRT1.\n",

We investigated the efficacy of an interleukin-17A neutralizing antibody in a multi-centre preclinical randomized controlled trial using a murine ischaemia reperfusion stroke model. Twelve-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 45 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in four centres. Mice were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either an anti-interleukin-17A (500 µg) or isotype antibody (500 µg) intravenously 1 h after reperfusion. The primary endpoint was infarct volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging three days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Secondary analysis included mortality, neurological score, neutrophil infiltration and the impact of the gut microbiome on treatment effects. Out of 136 mice, 109 mice were included in the analysis of the primary endpoint. Mixed model analysis revealed that interleukin-17A neutralization significantly reduced infarct sizes (anti-interleukin-17A: 61.77 ± 31.04 mm3; IgG control: 75.66 ± 34.79 mm3; P = 0.01). Secondary outcome measures showed a decrease in mortality (hazard ratio = 3.43, 95% confidence interval = 1.157-10.18; P = 0.04) and neutrophil invasion into ischaemic cortices (anti-interleukin-17A: 7222 ± 6108 cells; IgG control: 28 153 ± 23 206 cells; P < 0.01). There was no difference in Bederson score. The analysis of the gut microbiome showed significant heterogeneity between centres (R = 0.78, P < 0.001, n = 40). Taken together, neutralization of interleukin-17A in a therapeutic time window resulted in a significant reduction of infarct sizes and mortality compared with isotype control. It suggests interleukin-17A neutralization as a potential therapeutic target in stroke.\n",

      "Studies on the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics were carried out more than half a century ago. Subsequently, many cell and animal experiments attempted to verify the findings. However, in clinical trials, the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics were not observed. These contradictory results suggest a mismatch between basic research and clinical trials. The Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable X (STAIR) proposed that the emergence of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) would provide a proper platform to verify the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics because the haemodynamics of patients undergoing EVT is very close to the ischaemia-reperfusion model in basic research. With the widespread use of EVT, it is necessary for us to re-examine the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics to guide the use of anesthetics during EVT because the choice of anesthesia is still based on team experience without definite guidelines. In this paper, we describe the research status of anesthesia in EVT and summarize the neuroprotective mechanisms of some anesthetics. Then, we focus on the contradictory results between clinical trials and basic research and discuss the causes. Finally, we provide an outlook on the neuroprotective effects of anesthetics in the era of endovascular therapy.\n",

      "The regenerative capacity of the central nervous system is very limited and few effective treatments are currently available for spinal cord injury. It is therefore a priority to develop new drugs that can promote structural and functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Previous studies have shown that peptides can promote substantial repair and regeneration of injured tissue. While amphibians have a pronounced ability to regenerate the spinal cord, few studies have investigated the effect of amphibian spinal cord-derived peptides on spinal cord injury. Here we report for the first time the successful identification and isolation of a new polypeptide, VD11 (amino acid sequence: VDELWPPWLPC), from the spinal cord of an endemic Chinese amphibian (Odorrana schmackeri). In vitro experiments showed that VD11 promoted the secretion of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in BV2 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, as well as the proliferation and synaptic elongation of PC12 cells subjected to hypoxia. In vivo experiments showed that intravertebral injection of VD11 markedly promoted recovery of motor function in rats with spinal cord injury, alleviated pathological damage, and promoted axonal regeneration. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and western blotting showed that VD11 may affect spinal cord injury through activation of the AMPK and AKT signaling pathways. In summary, we discovered a novel amphibian-derived peptide that promotes structural and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.\n",

To better understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, in this study we compared hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury and simple hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats. First, based on the conventional Rice-Vannucci model of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, we established a rat model of hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury by creating a common carotid artery muscle bridge. Then we performed tandem mass tag-based proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins between the hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury model and the conventional Rice-Vannucci model and found that the majority were mitochondrial proteins. We also performed transmission electron microscopy and found typical characteristics of ferroptosis, including mitochondrial shrinkage, ruptured mitochondrial membranes, and reduced or absent mitochondrial cristae. Further, both rat models showed high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and low levels of myelin basic protein, which are biological indicators of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and indicate similar degrees of damage. Finally, we found that ferroptosis-related Ferritin (Fth1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 were expressed at higher levels in the brain tissue of rats with hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury than in rats with simple hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Based on these results, it appears that the rat model of hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion brain injury is more closely related to the pathophysiology of clinical reperfusion. Reperfusion not only aggravates hypoxic-ischemic brain injury but also activates the anti-ferroptosis system.\n",

      "Previous studies have shown that the receptor tyrosine kinase Eph receptor A4 (EphA4) is abundantly expressed in the nervous system. The EphA4 signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating motor neuron ferroptosis in motor neuron disease. To investigate whether EphA4 signaling is involved in ferroptosis in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury, in this study we established a rat model of spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury by clamping the left carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. We found that spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury increased EphA4 expression in the neurons of anterior horn, markedly worsened ferroptosis-related indicators, substantially increased the number of mitochondria exhibiting features consistent with ferroptosis, promoted deterioration of motor nerve function, increased the permeability of the blood-spinal cord barrier, and increased the rate of motor neuron death. Inhibition of EphA4 largely rescued these effects. However, intrathecal administration of the ferroptosis inducer Erastin counteracted the beneficial effects conferred by treatment with the EphA4 inhibitor. Mass spectrometry and a PubMed search were performed to identify proteins that interact with EphA4, with the most notable being Beclin1 and Erk1/2. Our results showed that inhibition of EphA4 expression reduced binding to Beclin1, markedly reduced p-Beclin1, and reduced Beclin1-XCT complex formation. Inhibition of EphA4 also reduced binding to p-Erk1/2 and markedly decreased the expression of c-Myc, transferrin receptor 1, and p-Erk1/2. Additionally, we observed co-localization of EphA4 and p-Beclin1 and of EphA4 and p-ERK1/2 in neurons in the anterior horn. In conclusion, EphA4 participates in regulating ferroptosis of spinal motor neurons in the anterior horn in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion injury by promoting formation of the Beclin1-XCT complex and activating the Erk1/2/c-Myc/transferrin receptor 1 axis.\n",

      "In the central nervous system, the formation of fibrotic scar after injury inhibits axon regeneration and promotes repair. However, the mechanism underlying fibrotic scar formation and regulation remains poorly understood. M2 macrophages regulate fibrotic scar formation after injury to the heart, lung, kidney, and central nervous system. However, it remains to be clarified whether and how M2 macrophages regulate fibrotic scar formation after cerebral ischemia injury. In this study, we found that, in a rat model of cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion, fibrosis and macrophage infiltration were apparent in the ischemic core in the early stage of injury (within 14 days of injury). The number of infiltrated macrophages was positively correlated with fibronectin expression. Depletion of circulating monocyte-derived macrophages attenuated fibrotic scar formation. Interleukin 4 (IL4) expression was strongly enhanced in the ischemic cerebral tissues, and IL4-induced M2 macrophage polarization promoted fibrotic scar formation in the ischemic core. In addition, macrophage-conditioned medium directly promoted fibroblast proliferation and the production of extracellular matrix proteins in vitro. Further pharmacological and genetic analyses showed that sonic hedgehog secreted by M2 macrophages promoted fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and that this process was mediated by secretion of the key fibrosis-associated regulatory proteins transforming growth factor beta 1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9. Furthermore, IL4-afforded functional restoration on angiogenesis, cell apoptosis, and infarct volume in the ischemic core of cerebral ischemia rats were markedly impaired by treatment with an sonic hedgehog signaling inhibitor, paralleling the extent of fibrosis. Taken together, our findings show that IL4/sonic hedgehog/transforming growth factor beta 1 signaling targeting macrophages regulates the formation of fibrotic scar and is a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.\n",

      "Chronic kidney diseases affect a substantial percentage of the adult population worldwide. This observation emphasizes the need for novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the onset and progression of renal diseases. Recent advances in genomics have uncovered a previously unanticipated link between the non-coding genome and human kidney diseases. Here we screened and analysed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) previously identified in mouse kidneys by genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, for conservation in humans and differential expression in renal tissue from healthy and diseased individuals. Our data suggest that LINC01187 is strongly down-regulated in human kidney tissues of patients with diabetic nephropathy and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, as well as in murine models of kidney diseases, including unilateral ureteral obstruction, nephrotoxic serum-induced glomerulonephritis and ischemia/reperfusion. Interestingly, LINC01187 overexpression in human kidney cells in vitro inhibits cell death indicating an anti-apoptotic function. Collectively, these data suggest a negative association of LINC01187 expression with renal diseases implying a potential protective role.\n",

      "Damage to peritubular capillaries is a key process that contributes to acute kidney injury (AKI) progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) plays a critical role in maintaining the renal microvasculature. However, the physiological role of VEGFA in various AKI durations remains unclear. A severe unilateral ischemia‒reperfusion injury model was established to provide an overview of VEGFA expression and the peritubular microvascular density from acute to chronic injury in mouse kidneys. Therapeutic strategies involving early VEGFA supplementation protecting against acute injury and late anti-VEGFA treatment for fibrosis alleviation were analyzed. A proteomic analysis was conducted to determine the potential mechanism of renal fibrosis alleviation by anti-VEGFA. The results showed that two peaks of extraglomerular VEGFA expression were observed during AKI progression: one occurred at the early phase of AKI, and the other occurred during the transition to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Capillary rarefaction progressed despite the high expression of VEGFA at the CKD stage, and VEGFA was associated with interstitial fibrosis. Early VEGFA supplementation protected against renal injury by preserving microvessel structures and counteracting secondary tubular hypoxic insults, whereas late anti-VEGFA treatment attenuated renal fibrosis progression. The proteomic analysis highlighted an array of biological processes related to fibrosis alleviation by anti-VEGFA, which included regulation of supramolecular fiber organization, cell-matrix adhesion, fibroblast migration, and vasculogenesis. These findings establish the landscape of VEGFA expression and its dual roles during AKI progression, which provides the possibility for the orderly regulation of VEGFA to alleviate early acute injury and late fibrosis.\n",

      "Anti-oxidant stress is a potential strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Here, we found a novel free radical scavenger termed as CZK, which is derived from alkaloids contained in Clausena lansium. In this study, we first compared cytotoxicity and biological activity between CZK and its parent's compound Claulansine F. It was found that CZK had lower cytotoxicity and improved anti-oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury than its parent's compound. Free radical scavenging test showed that CZK had a strong inhibitory effect on hydroxyl free radicals with the IC50 of 77.08 nM. Intravenous injection of CZK (50 mg/kg) significantly alleviated ischemia-reperfusion injury, manifested by reduced neuronal damage and decreased oxidative stress. Consistent with the findings, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were increased. Molecular docking predicted that CZK might be combined with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) complex. Our results also confirmed that CZK upregulated the contents of Nrf2 and its target gene products Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H: Quinone Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). In conclusion, CZK had a potential therapeutic effect for ischemic stroke by activating Nrf2-mediated antioxidant system.\n",

However, five pivotal trials in 2015(MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, EXTEND-IA, SWIFT PRIME, and REVASCAT), using newer-generation devices(e.g., stent retrievers), have shown stroke thrombectomy to clearly improve the functional outcome of patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery or the M1 portion of the middle cerebral artery(baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 6; baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score ≥ 6), and who could receive thrombectomy within 6 h of symptom onset . In 2018, the efficacy of stroke thrombectomy for late-presenting patients with up to 16-24 h of onset and those who had a mismatch between neurological severity and ischemic core volume was also established by the DAWN and DEFUSE 3 trials. In 2022, the efficacies of stroke thrombectomy for patients with a large ischemic core or basilar artery occlusion were identified.

      "Renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury results in damage to the renal tubules and causes impairments in sodium [Na+] reabsorption. Given the inability to conduct mechanistic renal I/R injury studies in vivo in humans, eccrine sweat glands have been proposed as a surrogate model given the anatomical and physiological similarities. We tested the hypothesis that sweat Na+ concentration is elevated following I/R injury during passive heat stress. We also tested the hypothesis that I/R injury during heat stress will impair cutaneous microvascular function. Fifteen young healthy adults completed ∼160 min of passive heat stress using a water-perfused suit (50°C). At 60 min of whole body heating, one upper arm was occluded for 20 min followed by a 20-min reperfusion. Sweat was collected from each forearm via an absorbent patch pre- and post-I/R. Following the 20-min reperfusion, cutaneous microvascular function was measured via local heating protocol. Cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated as red blood cell flux/mean arterial pressure and normalized to CVC during local heating to 44°C. Na+ concentration was log-transformed and data were reported as a mean change from pre-I/R (95% confidence interval). Changes in sweat sodium concentration from pre-I/R differed between arms post-I/R (experimental arm: +0.97 [+0.67 - 1.27] [LOG] Na+; control arm: +0.68 [+0.38 - 0.99] [LOG] Na+; P < 0.01). However, CVC during the local heating was not different between the experimental (80 ± 10%max) and control arms (78 ± 10%max; P = 0.59). In support of our hypothesis, Na+ concentration was elevated following I/R injury, but likely not accompanied by alterations in cutaneous microvascular function.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the present study, we have demonstrated that sweat sodium concentration is elevated following ischemia-reperfusion injury during passive heat stress. This does not appear to be mediated by reductions in cutaneous microvascular function or active sweat glands, but may be related to alterations in local sweating responses during heat stress. This study demonstrates a potential use of eccrine sweat glands to understand sodium handling following ischemia-reperfusion injury, particularly given the challenges of in vivo studies of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in humans.\n",

      "An ischemic stroke usually causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and excessive oxidative stress (OS) levels. Kinsenoside (KD), a major effective compound extracted in Chinese herbal medicine Anoectochilus roxburghii (Orchidaceae), has anti-OS effects. The present study focused on exploring KD's protection against OS-mediated cerebral endothelial cell damage and BBB damage within the mouse model. Intracerebroventricular administration of KD upon reperfusion after 1 h ischemia decreased infarct volumes, neurological deficit, brain edema, neuronal loss, and apoptosis 72 h post-ischemic stroke. KD improved BBB structure and function, as evidenced by a lower 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose pass rate of the BBB and upregulation of tight junction (TJ) proteins such as occludin, claudin-5, and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). KD protected bEnd.3 endothelial cells from oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury in an in-vitro study. Meanwhile, OGD/R reduced transepithelial electronic resistance, whereas KD significantly increased TJ protein levels. Furthermore, based on in-vivo and in-vitro research, KD alleviated OS in endothelial cells, which is related to nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation as well as Nrf2/haem oxygenase 1 signaling protein stimulation. Our findings demonstrated that KD might serve as a potential compound for treating ischemic stroke involving antioxidant mechanisms.\n",

      "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a multifactorial process caused by transient tissue hypoxia and the following reoxygenation, commonly occurring in liver transplantation and hepatectomy. Hepatic I/R can induce a systemic inflammatory response, liver dysfunction, or even multiple organ failure. Although we have previously reported that taurine could attenuate acute liver injury after hepatic I/R, only a tiny proportion of the systemically injected taurine could reach the targeted organ and tissues. In this present study, we prepared taurine nanoparticles (Nano-taurine) by coating taurine with neutrophil membranes and investigated the protective effects of Nano-taurine against I/R-induced injury and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that Nano-taurine restored liver function by declining AST and ALT levels and reducing histology damage. Nano-taurine decreased inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) and oxidants including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) was increased, while prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2) was decreased upon administration of Nano-taurine, suggesting that inhibiting ferroptosis may be involved in the mechanism during hepatic I/R injury.

However, the effects of 2i-10 and the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on pathologic brain in cardiac I/R injury are unknown. We hypothesized that 2i-10 and NAC offer similar neuroprotection levels against dendritic spine reduction through attenuation of brain inflammation, loss of tight junction integrity, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive gliosis, and suppression of AD protein expression in rats with cardiac I/R injury. Male rats were allocated to either sham or acute cardiac I/R group (30 min of cardiac ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion). Rats in cardiac I/R group were given one of following treatments intravenously at the onset of reperfusion: vehicle, 2i-10 (20 or 40 mg/kg), and NAC (75 or 150 mg/kg). The brain was then used to determine biochemical parameters. Cardiac I/R led to cardiac dysfunction with dendritic spine loss, loss of tight junction integrity, brain inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with 2i-10 (both doses) effectively reduced cardiac dysfunction, tau hyperphosphorylation, brain inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, dendritic spine loss, and improved tight junction integrity. Although both doses of NAC effectively reduced brain mitochondrial dysfunction, treatment using a high dose of NAC reduced cardiac dysfunction, brain inflammation, and dendritic spine loss. In conclusion, treatment with 2i-10 and a high dose of NAC at the onset of reperfusion alleviated brain inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, consequently reducing dendritic spine loss in rats with cardiac I/R injury.\n",

A total of 20 C57BL/6 male mice (10 control, 10 GIK) sustained a hindlimb IR injury using a 2.5-hour rubber band tourniquet. Immediately prior to tourniquet placement, a subcutaneous osmotic pump was placed which infused control mice with saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and treated mice with GIK (40% glucose, 50 U/l insulin, 80 mEq/L KCl, pH 4.5) at a rate of 16 µl/hr for 26.5 hours. At 24 hours following tourniquet removal, bilateral (tourniqueted and non-tourniqueted) gastrocnemius muscles were triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)-stained to quantify percentage muscle viability. Bilateral peroneal muscles were used for gene expression analysis, serum creatinine and creatine kinase activity were measured, and a validated murine ethogram was used to quantify pain before euthanasia. GIK treatment resulted in a significant protection of skeletal muscle with increased viability (GIK 22.07% (SD 15.48%)) compared to saline control (control 3.14% (SD 3.29%)) (p = 0.005). Additionally, GIK led to a statistically significant reduction in gene expression markers of cell death (CASP3, p < 0.001) and inflammation (NOS2, p < 0.001; IGF1, p = 0.007; IL-1β, p = 0.002; TNFα, p = 0.012), and a significant reduction in serum creatine kinase (p = 0.004) and creatinine (p < 0.001). GIK led to a significant reduction in IR-related pain (p = 0.030). Systemic GIK infusion during and after limb ischaemia protects murine skeletal muscle from cell death, kidneys from reperfusion metabolites, and reduces pain by reducing post-ischaemic inflammation.\n",

Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure increases asthma and respiratory infection hospitalizations and contributes to sudden unexpected infant death. Few pediatric hospitalist-led smoking cessation studies are formal quality improvement (QI), with most at academic institutions and studying caregivers.To increase SHS exposure/tobacco use screening, smoking cessation discharge instructions, and Smokers' Helpline referrals for community hospital pediatric patients/caregivers through QI.All pediatric, newborn, and NICU admissions were eligible. The baseline period was December 2019 through November 2020 and intervention period December 2020 through June 2021. Interventions included hospitalist education, standardizing documentation, visual reminders, and Helpline wallet cards. The primary measure was monthly percentage of patients screened for SHS exposure/tobacco use. Secondary measures were percentage of patients/caregivers positive for SHS exposure/tobacco use who received (1) discharge instructions or (2) Helpline referral. Length of stay was a balancing measure. Primary and balancing measures were analyzed with statistical process control. Secondary measures were monitored on run charts.Average SHS exposure/tobacco use screening rates increased from 14% to 90%, meeting special cause variation beginning December 2020. Median discharge instructions increased from 0% to 56%. Helpline referrals increased from 0% to 17%. Length of stay remained approximately 2 days.Pediatrician-led QI can increase SHS exposure/tobacco use screening and interventions in the community hospital setting to encourage smoke exposure reduction and smoking cessation for patients and caregivers.\""
