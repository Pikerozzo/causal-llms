# Causal Graph Identification by Large Language Models

Advances in causal inference are vital across multiple fields and contexts. A correct and complete understanding of the causal relationships behind the system of interest is a fundamental requirement for making accurate decisions.
Several methods and techniques can be used to identify causal relationships with the task called causal discovery, but many of these approaches present different flaws and weaknesses. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used as a new assistant to aid human efforts and contributing to the task of causal analysis. This project aims to evaluate the ability of LLMs in identifying causal relationships and causal graphs from natural language texts. Specifically, the LLM used in the project is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, which is one of the most important and advanced LLMs recently developed. We also present a set of techniques that can be used to improve the accuracy of LLM results. The project involved implementing a software infrastructure to collect textual data and use the GPT API for conducting causal discovery. The results showed that LLMs provide non-trivial contribution in helping with the identification of causal graphs. The application of LLMs to tasks of this nature is still in its early stages and has some limitations, but it has achieved some promising results and revealed new opportunities.
